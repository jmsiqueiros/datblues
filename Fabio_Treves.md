Treves's [[nickname]] is \"il Puma di Lambrate\" (Lambrate's Cougar), mimicking the British bluesman [[John Mayall]], known as the \"Manchester's Lion\". [[Lambrate]] is the quarter of Milan where Treves grew up.\n\n==Life and career==\nBorn and raised in [[Milan]], Fabio Treves became interested in music at a young age, helped by the father's passion for a variety of musical genres, including [[classical music]], [[jazz]], [[blues]], and Portuguese [[Fado]]. Treves' interest in music led him to study a wide range of [[musical instrument]]s, including [[bass (instrument)|bass]], [[organ (music)|organ]], [[trumpet]], and [[alto sax]]. During the 1960s he began playing what would become his signature instrument, the [[harmonica]].\n\nHe settled near Milan as a blues harmonica player, inspired by [[Sonny Terry]], [[Little Walter]], [[Paul Butterfield]], [[Alan Wilson (musician)|Alan Wilson]], and [[Sonny Boy Williamson II]].\n\nIn 1967, he played with his first band, the Friday Blues Group. He later joined the Simonluca e l'Enorme Maria band, which performed at the [[Festival di Sanremo]] in 1972. The following year, he again took part in the Festival, this time as a chorister for [[Fausto Leali]], in the song \"La Bandiera di Sole.\"\n\nIn 1974, Treves founded the first Italian blues band, the Treves Blues Band. Soon after, he met the Texan guitarist and harmonicist Cooper Terry after Terry's move to Italy, and the two began a long musical collaboration. During his career, Treves has played with [[Dave Kelly (musician)|Dave Kelly]], [[Sunnyland Slim]], [[Johnny Shines]], [[Homesick James]], [[Willie Mabon]], [[Billy Branch]], [[Dave Kelly (musician)|Dave Kelly]], [[Paul Jones (singer)|Paul Jones]], [[Alexis Korner]], [[Bob Margolin]], [[Sam Lay]], [[Louisiana Red]], [[Gordon Smith (musician)|Gordon Smith]], [[Son Seals]], and [[Eddie Boyd]]. He met [[Frank Zappa]] during his Italian visit and remains the only Italian musician to have played with Zappa on stage.\n\nTreves has participated in many [[music festival]]s in Italy and around the world. He continues to publish blues music in Italy, having released more than ten [[album]]s to date.\n\nHis collaborations have reached many levels of Italian music, having has worked with artists including [[Angelo Branduardi]], [[Pierangelo Bertoli]],  [[Eugenio Finardi]], [[Riccardo Cocciante]], [[Mina (singer)|Mina]], and [[Ivan Graziani]], as well as some non-blues collaborations with [[Articolo 31]].\n\n==Discography==\n===Treves Blues Band===\n* 1975: 'Treves Blues Band'' (Red Record)\n* 1980: ''Treves Blues Band & Mike Bloomfield Live'' (Mama Barley Records, MB 0001)\n* 1980: ''Treves Blues Band 2'' (Young Records)\n* 1985: ''Treves Blues Band 3'' (Buscemi Records)\n* 1996: ''Treves Blues Band Live!''
