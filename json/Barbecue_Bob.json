His [[nickname]] came from the fact that he was a [[chef|cook]] in a [[barbecue]] restaurant. One of the two extant photographs of Bob show him playing his [[guitar]] while wearing a full length white apron and cook's hat.\n\n==Early life==\nHe was born in [[Walnut Grove, Georgia|Walnut Grove]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. He and his brother, [[Charley Lincoln|Charlie Hicks]], together with [[Curley Weaver]], were taught how to play the guitar by Curley's mother, Savannah \"Dip\" Weaver.<ref name= barlow>Barlow, William. ''\"Looking Up At Down\": The Emergence of Blues Culture''. Temple University Press (1989), pp. 195\u201396. ISBN 0-87722-583-4.</ref> Bob began playing the 6-string guitar but picked up the [[Twelve string guitar|12-string guitar]] after moving to [[Atlanta, Georgia]] in 1923-1924. He became one of the prominent performers of the newly developing early Atlanta blues style.\n\nIn Atlanta, Hicks worked a variety of jobs, playing music on the side.  While working at Tidwells' Barbecue in a north Atlanta suburb, Hicks came to the attention of [[Columbia Records]] talent scout Dan Hornsby.  Hornsby recorded him and decided to use Hicks's job as a gimmick, having him pose in chef's whites and hat for publicity photos and dubbing him \"Barbecue Bob\".<ref name=barlow/>\n\n==Career==\nDuring his short career he [[sound recording and reproduction|recorded]] 68 [[gramophone record|78-rpm]]  sides. He recorded his first side, \"Barbecue Blues\", in March 1927.  The [[gramophone record|record]] quickly sold 15,000 copies and made him a best selling [[musician|artist]] for [[Columbia Records|Columbia]]'s race series. Despite this initial success, it was not until his second recording session, in [[New York City|New York]] during June 1927, that he firmly established himself on the race market. At this session he recorded \"Mississippi Heavy Water Blues\", a song inspired by the major floods taking place in [[Great Mississippi Flood of 1927|Mississippi]] at that time.<ref name=\"russell\">{{cite book\n| first= Tony\n| last= Russell\n| year= 1997\n| title= The Blues - From Robert Johnson to Robert Cray\n| edition= \n| publisher=Carlton Books Limited \n| location= Dubai\n| pages= 90\n| isbn= 1-85868-255-X}}</ref>  This song, as well as his other blues releases, gained considerable popularity, and his records sold much better than those of other local blues musicians.<ref name=barlow/>\n\nThe two part [[duet (music)|duet]] with crosstalk, \"It Won't Be Long Now\" was recorded with his brother Charlie (a/k/a Charlie Lincoln, or Laughing Charlie) in Atlanta on  November 5, 1927. In April 1928, Bob recorded two sides with the female [[singing|vocalist]] Nellie Florence, whom he had known since childhood, and also produced \"Mississippi Low Levee Blues\", a sequel to \"Mississippi Heavy Water Blues\". In April 1930, he recorded \"We Sure Got Hard Times Now\", which contains bleak references to the early effects of [[The Depression]]. Although Barbecue Bob remained predominantly a blues musician, he also recorded a few traditional and spiritual songs including \"[[When the Saints Go Marching In]]\", \"[[Poor Boy Blues|Poor Boy, Long Ways from Home]]\" and \"Jesus' Blood Can Make Me Whole\".\n\nBarbecue Bob also recorded as a member of The Georgia Cotton Pickers in December 1930, a group that included guitarist [[Curley Weaver]] and harmonica player [[Buddy Moss]].  As a group they recorded a handful of sides including their own adaptation of [[Blind Blake]]'s \"Diddie Wa Diddie\" (recorded as \"Diddle-Da-Diddle\") and the [[Mississippi Sheiks]]' \"[[Sitting on Top of the World]]\" (recorded as \"I'm On My Way Down Home\"). These were the last recordings that Bob recorded. \n\nHe died in [[Lithonia, Georgia]], of a combination of [[tuberculosis]] and [[pneumonia]] brought on by [[influenza]], at the age of 29, on October 21, 1931. His recording of \"Mississippi Heavy Water Blues\" (about the 1927 flood) was apparently played at his graveside before burial.\n\n==Musical style==\nBob developed a \"flailing\" or \"frailing\" style of playing guitar more often associated with the traditional [[clawhammer]] [[banjo]] (as did his brother, and, initially, Curley Weaver). He used a [[bottleneck guitar|bottleneck]] regularly on his 12-string guitar, playing in an elemental style that relied on an [[open tuning|open]] Spanish tuning reminiscent of [[Charley Patton]].  He had a strong voice that he embellished with growling and [[falsetto]], and a percussive singing style.<ref name=barlow/>\n\n==Influence==\nBob had some influence on Atlanta blues musicians such as the young [[Buddy Moss]] (who played harmonica with him on The Georgia Cotton Pickers recordings), but his way of playing was quickly overshadowed by the finger-picked [[Piedmont blues]] style that rose in popularity by the late 1920s/early 30s as can be heard in the development of the recordings of [[Curley Weaver]]. Barbecue Bob's \"[[Motherless Child Blues]]\" was recorded and performed on stage by [[Eric Clapton]]. [[John Fahey]] attributes his arrangement of \"Poor Boy a Long Ways From Home\" to Barbecue Bob in his 1979 \"Best Of\" book of tablature. More correctly, Fahey attributes the song to his persona \"Blind Joe Death,\" and writes \"Death learned this from an old Columbia record by Barbecue Bob [14246-D], which the Death household at one time possessed.\" Bob's elder brother, Charley, also played blues and was recorded by Columbia under the name \"Laughing\" Charley Lincoln. However, he never received the same acclaim as his brother.\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of blues musicians]]\n*[[List of Country blues musicians]]\n*[[List of guitarists]]\n*[[List of nicknames of blues musicians]]\n*[[List of Piedmont blues musicians]]\n*[[Yazoo Records]]\n\n==Recording sessions==\n*Atlanta, 25 March 1927\n*New York City, 15 June 1927\n*New York City, 16 June 1927\n*Atlanta, 5 November 1927\n*Atlanta, 9 November 1927\n*Atlanta, 10 November 1927\n*Atlanta, 13 April 1928\n*Atlanta, 21 April 1928\n*Atlanta, 26 October 1928\n*Atlanta, 27 October 1928\n*Atlanta, 2 November 1928\n*Atlanta, 11 April 1929\n*Atlanta, 17 April 1929\n*Atlanta, 18 April 1929\n*Atlanta, 30 October 1929\n*Atlanta, 3 November 1929\n*Atlanta, 6 November 1929\n*Atlanta, 17 April 1930\n*Atlanta, 18 April 1930\n*Atlanta, 23 April 1930\n*Atlanta, 5 December 1930\n*Atlanta, 7 December 1930\n*Atlanta, 8 December 1930\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n*Swinton, Paul.
