He was also referred to as '''Blind Snooks Eaglin''' in his early years.\n\nBorn '''Fird Eaglin, Jr.''', his vocal style was reminiscent of [[Ray Charles]]; in the 1950s, when he was in his late teens, he would sometimes bill himself as \"Little Ray Charles\". Generally regarded as a legend of New Orleans music, he played a wide range of music within the same concert, album, or even song: [[blues]], [[rock and roll]], [[jazz]], [[country music|country]], and [[Latin music|Latin]].<ref name=\"Music\">{{cite book\n| first= Paul\n| last= Du Noyer\n| year= 2003\n| title= The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Music\n| edition= 1st\n| publisher= Flame Tree Publishing \n| location= Fulham, London\n| isbn= 1-904041-96-5\n| page= 161}}</ref> In his early years, he also played some straight-ahead acoustic blues.<ref name=\"Music\"/>\n\nHis ability to play a wide range of songs and make them his own earned him the nickname \"the human jukebox.\" Eaglin claimed in interviews that his musical repertoire included some 2,500 songs.<ref name=bluesaccess /> \n\nAt live shows, he did not usually prepare set lists, and was unpredictable, even to his bandmates. He played songs that came to his head, and he also took requests from the audience.\n\n==Career==\n===Childhood===\nEaglin lost his sight not long after his first birthday after being stricken with [[glaucoma]], and spent several years in the hospital with other ailments. Around the age of five Eaglin received a guitar from his father; he taught himself to play by listening to and playing along with the radio. A mischievous youngster, he was given the nickname \"Snooks\" after a radio character named [[Baby Snooks]].\n\n===Early years===\nIn 1947, at the age of 11, Eaglin  won a talent contest organized by the [[radio station]] WNOE by playing \"[[Twelfth Street Rag]]\".<ref name=bluesaccess /><ref name=\"offbeat\">''[[OffBeat (music magazine)|OffBeat]]'' magazine, February 1995 issue \"Snooks Eaglin on Parade\"</ref><ref name=\"bsr8\">''Blues & Soul Records Magazine'' No. 8, Mar. 31, 1996 (Blues Interactions) \"Snooks Eaglin Interview\"</ref> Three years later, he dropped out of the school for the blind to become a professional musician. In 1952, Eaglin joined the Flamingoes, a local seven-piece band started by [[Allen Toussaint]]. The Flamingoes did not have a bass player, and according to Eaglin, he played both the guitar and the bass parts at the same time on his guitar. He stayed with The Flamingoes for several years, until their dissolution in the mid-1950s. \n\nAs a solo artist, his recording and touring were inconsistent, and for a man with a career of about 50 years, his discography is rather slim. His first recording was in 1953, playing guitar at a recording session for [[James \"Sugar Boy\" Crawford]].\n\nThe first recordings under his own name came when [[Harry Oster]], a folklorist from [[Louisiana State University]], found him playing in the streets of New Orleans. Oster made recordings of Eaglin between 1958 and 1960 during seven sessions which later became records on various labels including [[Folkways Records|Folkways]], Folklyric, and [[Bluesville Records|Prestige/Bluesville]].<ref name=\"bsr6\">''Blues & Soul Records Magazine'' No. 6, Sept. 20, 1995 (Blues Interactions) \"Snooks Eaglin Story & Discography\"</ref> These recordings were in folk blues style, Eaglin with an acoustic guitar without a band.\n\n===1960s and 1970s===\nFrom 1960 to 1963, Eaglin recorded for [[Imperial Records|Imperial]].<ref name=\"Music\"/> He played electric guitar on Imperial sessions with backup from a band including  [[James Booker]] on piano and [[Smokey Johnson]] on drums. He recorded  a total of 26 tracks which can be heard on ''The Complete Imperial Recordings''. Much of the material on Imperial was written by [[Dave Bartholomew]]. Unlike the Harry Oster recordings, these works on Imperial are New Orleans R&B in the style for which he is widely known today.<ref name=\"Music\"/> After Imperial, in 1964, he recorded alone at his home with a guitar for the Swedish Broadcasting Corporation, released as ''I Blueskvarter 1964: Vol.3''.<ref>[http://www.jeffersonbluesmag.com/component/option,com_wrapper/Itemid,50/lang,sv/ ]{{dead link|date=March 2014}}</ref> For the remainder of the 1960s, he apparently made no recordings.\n\nHis next work came on the Swedish label Sonet in 1971. Another album ''Down Yonder'' was released in 1978 featuring [[Ellis Marsalis, Jr.|Ellis Marsalis]] on piano. Apart from his own work, he joined recording sessions with [[Professor Longhair]] in 1971 and 72 (''Mardi Gras in Baton Rouge''). He also played some funky guitar on [[The Wild Magnolias]]' first album recorded in 1973.\n\n===Black Top and later years===\nHe joined Nauman and Hammond Scott of [[Black Top Records]] in the 1980s which led to a [[recording contract]] with the label.<ref name=\"Music\"/> Eaglin's Black Top years were the most consistent years of his recording career. Between 1987 and 1999, he recorded four studio albums and a live album, and appeared as a guest on a number of recordings by other Black Top artists, including [[Henry Butler]], [[Earl King]], and [[Tommy Ridgley]].\n\nAfter Black Top Records closed its doors, Eaglin released ''The Way It Is'' on Money Pit Records, produced by the same Scott brothers of Black Top. In 1997, Eaglin's version of \"[[St. James Infirmary Blues|St. James Infirmary]]\", was featured in a [[United Kingdom|UK]] [[television advertisement]] for [[Budweiser (Anheuser-Busch)|Budweiser]] [[lager]].<ref name=\"russell\">{{cite book\n| first= Tony\n| last= Russell\n| year= 1997\n| title= The Blues: From Robert Johnson to Robert Cray\n| edition= \n| publisher= Carlton Books Limited \n| location= Dubai\n| pages= 108\u2013109\n| isbn= 1-85868-255-X}}</ref>\n\n===Death===\nEaglin died of a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] at Ochsner Medical Center in New Orleans on February 18, 2009.<ref name=\"picayune\" /><ref name=\"ap\">[http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5iNnNJ1kLZCjLZ3TEYB_EtVeNzy2QD96EBTSG0 ]{{dead link|date=March 2014}}</ref> He had been diagnosed with [[prostate cancer]] in 2008 and had been hospitalized for treatment.<ref name=\"ap\" /><ref>[http://offbeat.com/artman/publish/article_3519.shtml ]{{dead link|date=March 2014}}</ref> He was scheduled to make a comeback appearance at the [[New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival]] in Spring of 2009.<ref name=\"picayune\" /><ref name=\"ap\" />  In honor of his contributions to New Orleans music, he was depicted in an artist's rendering on the cover of the \"Jazz Fest Bible\" edition of ''[[OffBeat (music magazine)|Offbeat]]'' magazine,  for the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival in 2009.\n\nFor many years, Eaglin lived in St. Rose in the suburbs of New Orleans with his wife Dorothea. Though he did not play many live shows, he regularly performed at [[Rock n' Bowl]] in New Orleans, and also at the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival.<ref name=\"Music\"/>\n\n==Discography==\n===Original albums===\n*1958 ''New Orleans Street Singer'' recordings made by Dr [[Harry Oster]], of [[Louisiana State University]].
