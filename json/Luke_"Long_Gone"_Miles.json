Suitably inspired, Miles moved to [[Houston]], [[Texas]], in 1952, with the single aim of meeting [[Lightnin' Hopkins]].  Miles stated, \"I went to Houston for one reason. I went to see Lightnin\u2019 Hopkins. That's what I went for and that's what I did. Lightnin' Hopkins taught me just about everything about blues singing. The first time I ever sang in front of an audience was in 1952 with Lightnin'. The first day I met Lightnin' he named me \"Long Gone\" \u2026 and I've been Long Gone Miles ever since\".<ref name=\"TD\"/>\n\nAccording to Ed Pearl, \"Miles appeared on Lightnin's doorstep in Houston a long while back, and Lightnin' wanted to close the door. And Luke proceeded to just go to sleep on his doorstep.... he was a real country guy. So Lightnin' took a fancy to him and let him hang around and he was a good singer, and Lightnin' sometimes let him perform with him on stage\".<ref name=\"Govenar\">{{cite book\n| first= Alan\n| last= Govenar\n| year= 2010\n| title= Lightnin' Hopkins: His Life and Blues\n| edition= 1st\n| publisher= [[Independent Publishers Group|Chicago Review Press]]\n| location= [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]], United States\n| isbn= 978-1-55652-962-7\n| page= }}</ref>\n\nNervous at his first concert, Miles dropped the microphone.  However, he persevered and played at local [[nightclub|clubs]], and subsequently appeared on several of Hopkins recordings, which included Hopkins' '[[live album]]', ''Country Blues'' (1960).<ref name=\"TD\"/><ref name=\"Wirz\"/> In 1961, Miles relocated to [[Los Angeles]] but, with Hopkins' career starting to be \"rediscovered\" and booming, the two parted ways.<ref name=\"TD\">{{cite web |url=http://www.tdblues.com/?p=1417 |title=Luke \"Long Gone\" Miles |author= |date= |publisher=tdblues.com |accessdate=November 15, 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn 1962, Miles recorded two [[Single (music)|singles]] for [[Smash Records]], accompanied by [[Brownie McGhee]] and [[Sonny Terry]].<ref name=\"Wirz\"/> The [[A-side and B-side|b-side]] to both singles was the anti-war song \"War Time Blues\", where Miles expoused, \"Well, when I get my examination card, I want the doctor tell me I too doggone old\".<ref name=\"Guido\"/> Also in 1962, Miles teamed up with the guitarist, [[Willie Chambers]], and they performed together regularly for two years. In 1964, Miles released his ''Country Born'' [[album]] on [[Pacific Jazz Records|World Pacific]].  In addition, Miles recorded singles for Two Kings Records in 1965, and four years later a further one, \"Hello Josephine\", for [[Kent Records|Kent]].<ref name=\"TD\"/> A live recording of Miles was made at the [[Ash Grove (music club)|Ash Grove]], Los Angeles in 1966, where Miles was accompanied on acoustic guitar by Bernie Pearl, the brother of the Ash Grove proprietor, Ed Pearl.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wolfgangsvault.com/long-gone-miles-and-bernie-pearl/concerts/ash-grove-january-16-1966.html |title=Long Gone Miles and Bernie Pearl Concert - Los Angeles, 1966 |author=Alan Bershaw |date= |work= |publisher=Wolfgangsvault.com |accessdate=November 15, 2011}}</ref>\n\nHowever, in 1970, Miles lived up to his [[stage name]], and disappeared for a long time from performing and recording. He never spoke to, or heard from, Hopkins again.<ref name=\"TD\"/> The later album releases were ''Country Boy'' (1984), which included mainly previously unreleased tracks recorded in 1962; and ''Riding Around in My V8 Ford'' (2008) composed of tracks recorded live in [[Venice, Los Angeles|Venice, California]], in 1985.<ref name=\"Wirz\"/>\n\nMiles died on November 22, 1987, in Los Angeles, aged 62.<ref name=\"TD\"/>\n\n==Discography==\n===Albums===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!
