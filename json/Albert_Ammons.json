Ammons''' in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]], his parents were pianists, and he had learned to play by the age of ten. His interest in boogie-woogie is attributed to his close friendship with [[Meade Lux Lewis]] and also his father's interest in the style.  Both Albert and Meade would practice together on the piano in the Ammons household.  From the age of ten, Ammons learned about chords by marking the depressed keys on the family [[pianola]] (player piano) with a pencil and repeated the process until he had mastered it. <ref>Silvester, Peter, A Left Hand Like God: A Study of Boogie-Woogie, p. 91-92</ref>  He also played [[percussion]] in the [[Drum and bugle corps (classic)|drum and bugle corps]] as a [[adolescence|teenager]] and was soon performing with [[band (music)|bands]] on the Chicago [[nightclub|club]] scene. After [[World War I]] he became interested in the blues, learning by listening to Chicago pianists [[Hersal Thomas]] and the brothers Alonzo and [[Jimmy Yancey]].<ref>Santelli, Robert. ''The Big Book of Blues'', Penguin Books, page 13, (2001) - ISBN 0-14-100145-3</ref> \n\nIn the early to mid-1920s Ammons worked as a [[taxi cab|cab]] driver for the Silver Taxicab Company. In 1924 he met back up with boyhood friend and fellow taxi driver Meade Lux Lewis. Soon the two players began working as a team, performing at club parties. Ammons started his own band at the [[Club DeLisa]] in 1934 and remained at the club for the next two years.<ref name=\"russell\">{{cite book\n| first= Tony\n| last= Russell\n| year= 1997\n| title= The Blues - From Robert Johnson to Robert Cray\n| edition= \n| publisher=Carlton Books Limited \n| location= Dubai\n| pages= 88\n| isbn= 1-85868-255-X}}</ref> \nDuring that time he played with a five piece unit that included [[Guy Kelly]], Dalbert Bright, Jimmy Hoskins, and [[Israel Crosby]]. Ammons also [[sound recording and reproduction|recorded]] as Albert Ammons's Rhythm Kings for [[Decca Records]] in 1936. The Rhythm Kings' version of \"Swanee River Boogie\" sold a million copies. \n\nAmmons moved from Chicago to [[New York City|New York]], where he teamed up with another pianist, [[Pete Johnson]].<ref name=\"russell\"/> The two performed regularly at the [[Caf\u00e9 Society]],<ref name=\"russell\"/> occasionally joined by Lewis, and performed with other jazz musicians such as [[Benny Goodman]] and [[Harry James]]. \n\nIn 1938 Ammons appeared at [[Carnegie Hall]] with Johnson and Lewis at ''[[From Spirituals to Swing]]'', an event that helped launch the boogie-woogie craze.<ref name=\"russell\"/> Two weeks later, [[record producer]] [[Alfred Lion]], who had attended [[John H. Hammond]]'s ''[[From Spirituals to Swing]]'' [[concert]] on December 23, 1938, which had introduced Ammons and Lewis, started [[Blue Note Records]], recording nine Ammons [[solo (music)|solos]] including \"The Blues\" and \"Boogie Woogie Stomp\", eight by Lewis and a pair of [[duet (music)|duets]] in a one-day session in a rented [[recording studio|studio]].<ref>Vladimir, Bogdanov.

He continued to tour as a solo artist, and between 1946 and 1949 recorded his last sides for [[Mercury Records]], with bassist Israel Crosby, and took on the position of staff pianist with the [[Lionel Hampton]] Orchestra. In 1949 he played at [[President of the United States|President]] [[Harry S. Truman]]'s inauguration.<ref>Feather, Leonard G. ''Encyclopedia of Jazz'', Horizon Press, page 101, (1960) - ISBN 0-8180-1203-X</ref>\nDuring the last few years of his life Ammons played mainly in Chicago's ''Beehive Club'' and the ''Tailspin Club'', and just four days before he died he had been at the Yancey apartment listening to [[Don Ewell]] and Jimmy Yancey play. Albert himself could only play one song, having just regained the use of his hands after a temporary paralysis. <ref>Silvester, p. 186 </ref><ref>Olderen, Martin van, ''Albert Ammons - King of Blues and Boogie Woogie 1907-1949'', liner notes, Oldie Blues OL 2807, 1975</ref>  Albert Ammons died on December 2, 1949, in Chicago<ref name=\"dead rock\"/> and was interred at the [[Lincoln Cemetery (Blue Island)|Lincoln Cemetery]], at Kedzie Avenue in [[Blue Island, Illinois|Blue Island]], [[Worth Township, Cook County, Illinois|Worth Township]], [[Cook County, Illinois|Cook County]], Illinois.\n\n==Legacy==\nAmmons has had wide influence on countless pianists, such as [[Dave Alexander (blues musician)|Dave Alexander]], [[Dr. John]], [[Hadda Brooks]], [[Johnnie Johnson (musician)|Johnnie Johnson]], [[Ray Bryant]], [[Erroll Garner]], [[Katie Webster]], [[Axel Zwingenberger]], and the [[Germany|German]] pianist [[Joerg Hegemann]].
