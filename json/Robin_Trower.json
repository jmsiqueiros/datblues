In 1962, Trower formed a group that became [[The Paramounts]], later including Westcliff High School pupil [[Gary Brooker]]. The Paramounts disbanded in 1966 to pursue individual projects.  During this time, Trower created a local three-piece band called 'The Jam' (not to be confused with [[The Jam|the later group with Paul Weller]]). Trower then joined Brooker's new band Procol Harum following the success of their debut single \"[[A Whiter Shade of Pale]]\" in 1967, remaining with them until 1971 and appearing on Procol Harum's first five albums.\n\nBefore launching his own [[eponymous]] band, he joined singer [[Frankie Miller]], bass player [[James Dewar (rock vocalist)|James Dewar]], and former [[Jethro Tull (band)|Jethro Tull]] drummer [[Clive Bunker]] to form the short-lived combo Jude.<ref name=\"NME Rock 'N' Roll Years\">{{cite book\n| first= John\n| last= Tobler\n| year= 1992\n| title= NME Rock 'N' Roll Years\n| edition= 1st\n| publisher= Reed International Books Ltd\n| location= London\n| page= 233\n| id= CN 5585}}</ref>  This outfit did not record and soon split up.\n\nTrower retained Dewar as his bassist, who took on lead vocals as well, and recruited drummer [[Reg Isidore]] (later replaced by [[Bill Lordan]]) to form the Robin Trower Band in 1973.<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/>\n\nPerhaps Trower's most famous album is ''[[Bridge of Sighs (album)|Bridge of Sighs]]'' (1974).{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}  This album, along with his first and third solo albums, was produced by his former Procol Harum bandmate, organist [[Matthew Fisher]]. Despite differences, Trower's early power trio work was noted for [[Jimi Hendrix|Hendrixesque]] influences.<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/>\n\nTrower is an influential guitarist who has inspired other guitar legends such as [[Robert Fripp]], who praised him for his bends and the quality of his sounds, and took lessons from him.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.procolharum.com/99/rt_fripp.htm |title=Fripp on Trower |publisher=Procolharum.com |date=19 November 1996 |accessdate=2011-10-21}}</ref>\n\t\nIn the early 1980s, Trower teamed up with former [[Cream (band)|Cream]] bassist [[Jack Bruce]] and his previous drummers Lordan and Isidore, for two albums, ''BLT'' (Bruce, Lordan, Trower) and ''Truce'' (Trower, Bruce, Isidore).<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/>  After those albums, he released another album with James Dewar on vocals titled ''Back It Up'' in 1983.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/r20536 |title=Back It Up |work=AllMusic |accessdate=2011-12-23}}</ref>  Robin Trower was dropped from Chrysalis Records afterwards.<ref>\n{{cite book\n  | last = Muise\n  | first = Dan\n  | title = Gallagher, Marriott, Derringer & Trower: their lives and music\n  | publisher = [[Hal Leonard]]\n  | series = Rock Chronicles\n  | year = 2002\n  | page = 273\n  | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=JI4LHXgz7YEC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA273#v=onepage&q&f=false\n  | format = Google Books\n}}\n</ref>\n[[File:Robin Trower Liri Blues 2005.jpg|thumb|240px|left|Trower at the [[Liri Blues Festival]], Italy, in 2005]]\n\nIn 1991 Trower was also a part of the Night Of The Guitars II European tour organised by [[Sting (musician)|Sting]] and [[The Police]] manager [[Miles Copeland III|Miles Copeland]]. The tour featured [[Ronnie Montrose]], [[Saga]]'s [[Ian Crichton]], [[Dave Sharman]], [[Jan Akkerman]] and [[Laurie Wisefield]].\n\nThirteen albums later, Trower's album, ''Living Out of Time'' (2003), features the return of veteran bandmates [[Dave Bronze]] on bass, vocalist [[Davey Pattison]] (formerly with [[Ronnie Montrose|Ronnie Montrose's]] band [[Gamma (band)|Gamma]]) and [[Pete Thompson]] on drums\u2014the same line-up as the mid 1980s albums ''Passion'' and ''Take What You Need''.\n\nWith the same bandmates Trower gave a concert on his 60th birthday in [[Bonn]], [[Germany]]. The concert was recorded by the German television channel [[Westdeutscher Rundfunk|WDR]]. It was then released on [[DVD]] and subsequently on [[CD]] throughout Europe and later the US under the title ''[[Living Out Of Time: Live]]''. Trower toured the United States and Canada in the summer and autumn of 2006.\n\nIn 2007 Trower released a third recording with [[Jack Bruce]], ''Seven Moons'', featuring [[Gary Husband]] on drums.\n\nA 2008 world tour began in [[Ft. Pierce, Florida]] on 16 January 2008.  Joining Davey Pattison and Pete Thompson was [[Glenn Letsch]] (formerly of Gamma) playing bass.  European dates began in April. The 29 March 2008 show at the Royal Oak Music Theater in [[Royal Oak, Michigan]] was released as a [[double album]] on V12 Records.\n\nAs his \"big hero\" he referenced the early [[James Brown]] where blues is crossing over into rock and roll.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.guitarplayer.com/article/robin-trower/5524 | title=Robin Trower Interview by Darrin Fox | work=Guitar Player | date=17 August 2011 | accessdate=6 March 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Equipment==\nIn Procol Harum Trower typically played Gibson guitars.  Upon launching his solo career Trower changed to a Fender Stratocaster almost exclusively. \nDuring a tour with Jethro Tull, Robin arrived early for a sound check and found Martin Barre\u2019s Stratocaster (which Barre used for slide playing) propped up against an amplifier. Trower picked up the guitar, plugged it in, and with a shout which resounded around the auditorium yelled, \"This is it!\"\n\"I then switched to Strat\" he says. \"Up to then I had been playing Les Pauls.\"<ref>\n{{cite book\n  | last = Hunter\n  | first = Dave\n  | title = The Fender Stratocaster: The Life & Times of the World's Greatest Guitar & Its Players\n  | publisher = [[Voyageur Press]]\n  | year = 2013\n  | page = 178\n  | url = http://books.google.pl/books?id=bScQAgAAQBAJ&lpg=PA178&ots=F-A6pwdOzB&pg=PA178#v=onepage&q&f=true\n  | format = Google Books\n}}\n</ref>\n[[File:Robin Trower 3 - Robin Trower Band - 1975.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Trower in 1975]]Since then Trower has been a longtime proponent of the [[Fender Stratocaster]].  He currently uses his custom-built Strat (made by the [[Fender Custom Shop]]) which comes in Black, Arctic White and Midnight Wine Burst.  The guitar is equipped with a 1950s reissue pick-up in the neck position, a 1960s reissue in the middle position, and a Texas Special at the bridge.<ref>Guitar Player April 2008</ref>  Other features included a custom C-shaped maple neck featuring a large headstock with a Bullet truss-rod system, locking machine heads and a maple fingerboard with narrow-spaced [[abalone]] dot position inlays and 21 frets.  The Strats he plays live are an exact model of his signature guitar, which is entirely unmodified.  During live performances and on most of his albums, his [[guitar tuning|guitar is tuned]] a full step down to a [[D tuning|DGCFAD]] tuning.\n\nTrower uses between one and three 100-watt [[Marshall Amplification|Marshall]] heads with four to six cabinets on stage. While he usually uses two JCM 800s and a JCM 900, he also links [[Marshall 1959|100-watt Marshall Plexi heads]]. In studio sessions, Trower uses a mix of amplifiers, such as a Fender Blues Junior and Cornell Plexi Amplifers models to acquire different tonality. Recently, Trower has been using Marshall Vintage Modern 2466 heads live.\n\nHe has recently been using Fulltone pedals and effects.  He favours the OCD, Distortion Pro, Fat Boost, CLYDE Deluxe Wah, Deja Vibe 2, Soul-Bender, and a BOSS Chromatic Tuner. He runs his Deja Vibe into his distortion pedal to get his famous tone. He was given his own signature Fulltone Robin Trower Overdrive in late 2008.\n\nFor his 2009 and 2011 US tours Robin was using his Fender Custom Shop Signature Stratocaster into a Fulltone Deja Vibe 2, Fulltone Wahfull, Fulltone Clyde Standard Wah, Fulltone Full Drive, Fulltone Robin Trower Overdrive and Boss TU-2 Chromatic Tuner into two Marshall Vintage Modern 2466 heads.\n\n==Discography==\n\n===With Procol Harum===\n* 1967  ''[[Procol Harum (album)|Procol Harum]]''\n* 1968  ''[[Shine on Brightly]]'' (Trower sings backup on \"Wish Me Well\")\n* 1969  ''[[A Salty Dog]]'' (Trower sings lead on \"Crucifiction Lane\")\n* 1970  ''[[Ain't Nothin' to Get Excited About]]'' (members of Procol Harum, as Liquorice John Death)\n* 1970  ''[[Home (Procol Harum)|Home]]''\n* 1971  ''[[Broken Barricades]]'' (Trower sings lead on \"Song For A Dreamer\")\n* 1991  ''[[The Prodigal Stranger]]''\n* 1995  ''[[The Long Goodbye (Procol Harum album)|The Long Goodbye]]''<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\">{{cite book\n| first= Martin C.\n| last= Strong\n| year= 2000\n| title= The Great Rock Discography\n| edition= 5th\n| publisher= Mojo Books\n| location= Edinburgh\n| pages= 776\u2013777\n| isbn= 1-84195-017-3}}</ref>\n\n===With Robin Trower Band===\n\n====Studio albums====\n\n* 1973  ''[[Twice Removed from Yesterday]]''  \u2013 Certified Gold by RIAA\n* 1974  ''[[Bridge of Sighs (album)|Bridge of Sighs]]''  \u2013 Certified Gold by RIAA<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.riaa.org/goldandplatinumdata.php?table=SEARCH |title=Recording Industry Association of America |publisher=RIAA |accessdate=2011-10-21}}</ref>\n* 1975  ''[[For Earth Below (album)|For Earth Below]]''  \u2013 Certified Gold by RIAA\n* 1976  ''[[Long Misty Days (album)|Long Misty Days]]''  \u2013 Certified Gold by RIAA\n* 1977  ''[[In City Dreams]]''  \u2013 Certified Gold by RIAA\n* 1978  ''[[Caravan to Midnight]]''\n* 1980  ''[[Victims of the Fury]]''\n* 1983  ''[[Back It Up (Robin Trower album)|Back It Up]]''\n* 1987  ''[[Passion (Robin Trower album)|Passion]]''\n* 1988  ''[[Take What You Need]]''\n* 1990  ''[[In the Line of Fire (Robin Trower album)|In the Line of Fire]]''\n* 1994  ''[[20th Century Blues (Robin Trower album)|20th Century Blues]]''\n* 1997  ''[[Someday Blues]]''\n* 2000  ''[[Go My Way (album)|Go My Way]]''\n* 2004  ''[[Living Out of Time]]''\n* 2005  ''[[Another Days Blues]]''\n* 2009  ''[[What Lies Beneath (Robin Trower album)|What Lies Beneath]]''<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography 2\">{{cite book\n| first= Martin C.\n| last= Strong\n| year= 2000\n| title= The Great Rock Discography\n| edition= 5th\n| publisher= Mojo Books\n| location= Edinburgh\n| pages= 1005\u20131006\n| isbn= 1-84195-017-3}}</ref>\n* 2010 ''[[The Playful Heart]]''\n* 2013 ''[[Roots And Branches]]''\n\n====Live albums====\n\n* 1976  ''[[Robin Trower Live]]''\n* 1985  ''[[Beyond the Mist]]''\n* 1992  ''[[Live in Concert (Robin Trower album)|Live in Concert]]''\n* 1996  ''[[In Concert (Robin Trower album)|In Concert]]''\n* 1996  ''[[King Biscuit Flower Hour Presents Robin Trower]]''\n* 1999  ''[[This Was Now '74-'98]]''\n* 2005  ''[[Living Out Of Time: Live]] (Note: Also available on [[DVD]])\n* 2008  ''[[RT@RO.08]]''\n* 2011  ''[[Robin Trower at The BBC 1973-1975]]''\n\n====Compilation====\n\n* 1991  ''[[Essential Robin Trower]]''\n\n===With Bryan Ferry ===\n* 1993  ''[[Taxi (Bryan Ferry album)|Taxi]]'' ([[Bryan Ferry]])\n* 1994  ''[[Mamouna]]'' ([[Bryan Ferry]])\n* 2007  ''[[Dylanesque (album)|Dylanesque]]'' ([[Bryan Ferry]])\n\n===With Jack Bruce===\n* 1981  ''[[B.L.T.]]''\n* 1982  ''[[Truce (album)|Truce]]''\n* 1989  ''[[No Stopping Anytime]]'' (compilation)\n* 2008  ''[[Seven Moons]]''\n* 2009  ''[[Seven Moons Live]]'' (live)\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Robin Trower}}\n* [http://www.trowerpower.com/ TrowerPower.com] \u2013 Official website\n* [http://members.shaw.ca/stevesplace/Whatsnew2.htm Shaw.ca] \u2013 The complete history of The Robin Trower Band (fan site)\n* [http://www.modernguitars.com/archives/001649.html ModernGuitars.com] \u2013 2006 Robin Trower Interview with Brian D.
