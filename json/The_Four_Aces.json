Originally, Alberts sang with Mahoney playing behind him, and later they added Vaccaro on trumpet and Silvestri on drums.<ref name=vghof/> They played locally in the Philadelphia area, and Alberts started his own record label, [[Victoria Records (1952)|Victoria Records]], when they could not find a distributor to release their first record, \"[[(It's No) Sin]]\".<ref name=vghof/> It sold a million copies, and [[Decca Records]] soon signed the group, billing them as The Four Aces featuring Al Alberts.\n\nAlberts left the group in 1958 to try to make it as a soloist, but never made the charts. He was replaced as lead singer by Fred Diodati, who had attended South Philadelphia High School a few years after Alberts. After Alberts had left the group, Mahoney and Vaccaro also left. Silvestri never left the group, but led three new members: Diodati, Tony Alesi, and Joe Giglio. The Original Aces later asked Silvestri to rejoin the original group, and he did.\n\nIt was then that Diodati led a new line-up, which consisted of Diodati, Alesi, Giglio, and Harry Heisler. After almost 19 years with the group, Alesi developed a medical condition that forced him to leave the group. {{As of|2013}} the Four Aces members are Diodati, Giglio, Heisler, and Danny Colingo.  These members sing all the songs the original Four Aces had made popular at one time.\n\nIn 1975, Diodati, Alesi, Giglio, and Heisler were awarded the right to the name in a court suit in which the original members tried to re-establish their right.<ref name=vghof/> The court allowed the founding members to tour as \"The Original Four Aces, Featuring Al Alberts\", which they did, finally retiring the act in 1987. Diodati, Giglio, Heisler, and Colingo continue to legally use the name of the Four Aces and perform the songs made popular by the Original Four Aces.\n\nThe founding lead singer, Alberts, died of [[Death by natural causes|natural causes]] on November 27, 2009 at age 87.<ref>[http://www.thedeadrockstarsclub.com/2009b.html Thedeadrockstarsclub.com] - accessed April 2011</ref>  Mahoney died on July 12, 2012 of complications from Alzheimer's Disease at age 86.<ref>{{cite web|last=Naedele|first=Walter|title=David A.
