One of his earliest involvements was playing the [[bass guitar]] for the 1953 recording of \"Tin Pan Alley\" by Jimmy Wilson.<ref name=\"AMG\"/> His own efforts yielded the [[instrumental]] track, \"Johnny's House Party (Parts 1 & 2)\" on the Music City [[record label|label]], which reached number 13 on the [[United States|US]] ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs|R&B]] [[record chart|chart]] in June 1957. The [[gramophone record|record]] billed the act as 'John Heartsman, the Rhythm Rocker and the Gaylarks'.<ref name=\"Whitburn\">{{cite book |title= Top R&B/Hip-Hop Singles: 1942\u20131995|last=Whitburn |first=Joel |authorlink=Joel Whitburn |year=1996 |publisher=Record Research |page=188}}</ref> \n\nHis session work continued into the early 1960s, and he played on Tiny Powell's \"My Time After Awhile\", and Al King's [[cover version]] of \"[[Reconsider Baby]]\". Heartman's guitar playing technique involved imaginative use of the guitar's volume control, producing \"an eerie moan\".<ref name=\"AMG\"/> Heartsman's later work included playing in show bands, appearing in concert in [[Bar (establishment)|cocktail lounge]] settings, and as the touring organist for [[Joe Simon (musician)|Joe Simon]].  He spent 1970-1973 in Midland, Texas, as the houseband leader at The Chateau Club.  It was here that he hired young blues guitarist and singer/songwriter [[Jay Boy Adams]].  Adams credits Heartsman as one of his musical mentors.  By the late 1980s, Heartsman had reverted to playing the blues, and he released his debut [[album]], ''Sacramento'', in 1987.<ref name=\"AMG\"/> It was described by one reviewer as \"a great success\".<ref name=\"Encyc\"/> He had previously appeared at the [[San Francisco Blues Festival]] in 1985. The record producer, Dick Shurman, oversaw Heartsman's ''The Touch'', released by [[Alligator Records]] in 1991.<ref name=\"AMG\"/>\n\nOver the years, Heartsman's songwriting ability saw him pen tracks for Jesse James (\"Are You Gonna Leave Me\"), [[Roy Buchanan]] (\"Goose Grease\"), [[John P.
