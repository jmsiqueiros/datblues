Next to [[Muddy Waters]], Dixon is recognized as the most influential person in shaping the post-[[World War II]] sound of the [[Chicago blues]].<ref name=\"Trager2004\">Trager, Oliver (2004). ''Keys to the Rain: The Definitive Bob Dylan Encyclopedia''. Billboard Books. pp. 298\u2013299. ISBN 0-8230-7974-0</ref>\n\nDixon's songs have been recorded by countless musicians in many [[genre]]s as well as by various ensembles in which he participated. A short list of the his most famous compositions includes \"[[Hoochie Coochie Man]]\", \"[[I Just Want to Make Love to You]]\", \"[[Little Red Rooster]]\", \"[[My Babe]]\", \"[[Spoonful]]\", and \"[[You Can't Judge a Book by the Cover]]\".  These tunes were written during the peak of [[Chess Records]], 1950\u20131965, and performed by [[Muddy Waters]], [[Howlin' Wolf]], [[Little Walter]], and [[Bo Diddley]]; they influenced a worldwide generation of musicians.<ref>Dicaire, David (1999). ''Blues Singers: Biographies of 50 Legendary Artists of the Early 20th Century''. McFarland. p. 87. ISBN 0-7864-0606-2</ref>\n\nDixon also was an important link between the blues and [[rock and roll]], working with [[Chuck Berry]] and [[Bo Diddley]] in the late 1950s.  His songs were covered by some of the biggest [[musicians|artists]] of more recent times, such as [[Bob Dylan]], [[Cream (band)|Cream]], [[Jeff Beck]], [[The Doors]], [[Jimi Hendrix]], [[Led Zeppelin]], and [[The Rolling Stones]].  For a more comprehensive list of Willie Dixon's songs and artists who have recorded them, see [[List of songs written by Willie Dixon]].\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early life===\nDixon was born in [[Vicksburg, Mississippi|Vicksburg]], Mississippi on July 1, 1915.<ref name=\"amg\">{{cite web|last=Eder |first=Bruce |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/willie-dixon-mn0000959770 |title=Willie Dixon - Music Biography, Credits and Discography |publisher=AllMusic |accessdate=2013-03-13}}</ref> His mother Daisy often rhymed the things she said, a habit her son imitated. At the age of seven, young Dixon became an admirer of a band that featured pianist [[Little Brother Montgomery]]. Dixon was first introduced to [[blues]] when he served time on prison farms in Mississippi as an early teenager. He later learned how to sing harmony from local carpenter Leo Phelps. Dixon sang bass in Phelps' group The Jubilee Singers, a local [[gospel music|gospel]] quartet that regularly appeared on the Vicksburg radio station WQBC. Dixon began adapting poems he was writing as songs, and even sold some tunes to local music groups.\n\n===Adulthood===\nDixon left Mississippi for Chicago in 1936. A man of considerable stature, at 6 and a half feet and weighing over 250 pounds, he took up boxing; he was so successful that he won the Illinois State [[Golden Gloves]] [[Championship (professional wrestling)|Heavyweight Championship]] (Novice Division) in 1937.<ref name=\"Snowden1997\">Snowden, Don (1997).</ref> Dixon turned professional as a boxer and worked briefly as [[Joe Louis]]' sparring partner. After four fights, Dixon left boxing after getting into a fight with his manager over being cheated out of money.\n\nDixon met [[Leonard Caston]] at the boxing gym where they would harmonize at times. Dixon performed in several vocal groups in Chicago but it was Caston that got him to pursue music seriously.<ref name=\"Castonbio1\">{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p63195|pure_url=yes}}|title=Leonard Caston|last=Eder|first=Bruce|year=2010 |work=Biography of Leonard Caston|publisher=Rovi Corporation|accessdate=May 2, 2010}}</ref> Caston built him his first bass, made of a tin can and one string. Dixon's experience singing bass made the instrument familiar. He also learned the guitar.\n\nIn 1939, Dixon was a founding member of the Five Breezes, with Caston, Joe Bell, Gene Gilmore and Willie Hawthorne. The group blended blues, [[jazz]], and vocal harmonies, in the mode of the [[Ink Spots]]. Dixon's progress on the [[Upright bass]] came to an abrupt halt during the advent of World War II when he resisted the draft as a [[conscientious objector]] and was imprisoned for ten months.<ref name=\"amg\"/>  After the war, he formed a group named the Four Jumps of Jive and then reunited with Caston, forming the Big Three Trio, who went on to record for [[Columbia Records]].\n\n===Pinnacle of career===\n[[File:Jlwandwilliedixon.jpg|thumb|240px|left|Dixon, right, with friend [[Joe Louis Walker]], left]]\nDixon signed with [[Chess Records]] as a recording artist, but began performing less, being more involved with administrative tasks for the label. By 1951, he was a full-time employee at Chess, where he acted as producer, [[Artists and repertoire|talent scout]], [[session musician]] and staff songwriter. He was also a producer for Chess subsidiary [[Checker Records]]. His relationship with Chess was sometimes strained, although he stayed with the label from 1948 to the early 1960s. During this time Dixon's output and influence were prodigious.  From late 1956 to early 1959, he worked in a similar capacity for [[Cobra Records]], where he produced early singles for [[Otis Rush]], [[Magic Sam]], and [[Buddy Guy]].<ref>\n{{cite book\n  | last = Dixon\n  | first = Willie\n  | coauthors = Snowden, Don\n  | title = I Am the Blues\n  | publisher = Da Capo Press\n  | year = 1989\n  | pages = 103\u2013112\n  | url =\n  | id =\n  | isbn = 0-306-80415-8}}\n</ref>  He later recorded on [[Bluesville Records]].<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.wirz.de/music/blvilfrm.htm\n|title=Prestige Bluesville discography\n|accessdate=2006-11-17\n|publisher=Wirz.de\n}}</ref>  From the late 1960s until the middle 1970s, Dixon ran his own record label, [[Yambo Records]], along with two subsidiary labels, Supreme and Spoonful.  He released his 1971 album ''Peace?'' on Yambo, as well as singles by [[McKinley Mitchell]], [[Lucky Peterson]] and others.<ref>\n{{cite book\n  | last = Dixon\n  | first = Willie\n  | coauthors = Snowden, Don\n  | title = I Am the Blues\n  | publisher = Da Capo Press\n  | year = 1989\n  | page = 244\n  | url =\n  | id =\n  | isbn = 0-306-80415-8}}\n</ref>\n\nDixon is considered one of the key figures in the creation of [[Chicago blues]].

The organization works to preserve the blues\u2019 legacy and to secure copyrights and royalties for blues musicians who were exploited in the past. Speaking with the simple eloquence that was a hallmark of his songs, Dixon claimed, \"The blues are the roots and the other musics are the fruits. It\u2019s better keeping the roots alive, because it means better fruits from now on. The blues are the roots of all American music. As long as American music survives, so will the blues.\"\nIn 1977, unhappy with the royalties rate from ARC Music, he and Muddy Waters sued the Chess-owned publishing company, and with the proceeds from the lawsuit set up Hoochie Coochie Music.<ref>Inaba, Mitsutoshi (2010). ''Willie Dixon: Preacher of the Blues''. Scarecrow Press. p. 67. ISBN 0-8108-6993-4</ref>\n\nIn 1987, Dixon received an out-of-court settlement from Led Zeppelin after suing them for plagiarism, in relation to their use of his music for \"[[Bring It On Home (Sonny Boy Williamson II song)|Bring It On Home]]\" and his lyrics from his composition \"You Need Love\" (1962) for their track \"[[Whole Lotta Love]]\".<ref>Inaba, Mitsutoshi (2010).
