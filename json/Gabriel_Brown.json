By the late 1930s, Brown appeared as a singer on [[Cincinnati]] radio, and took part in the show ''St. Louis Woman''. He found employment with the [[civil service]], working for the [[Signal Corps (United States Army)|Army Signal Corps]] in [[Asbury Park, New Jersey|Asbury Park]], [[New Jersey]]. Brown had Joe Davis as his [[record producer]] on his first full recording session in 1943, and the twosome worked together until Brown's final sessions in 1952.<ref name=\"AMG\"/>\n\nIn 1945 Brown sang, \"I can't have no luck at all, the jinx is on me.\"<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.bellaonline.com/articles/art61162.asp\n|title=Folklore and Mythology Site |author=Phyllis Doyle Burns |date= |work= |publisher=Bellaonline.com |accessdate=May 25, 2011}}</ref>\n  \nSeveral of Brown's recordings were not released during his lifetime, and some of those that were issued were not always promoted tastefully or accurately. In the late 1940s, various tracks were licensed to [[Coral Records]]. Eventually Davis worked in [[Artists and repertoire|A&R]] for [[MGM Records]], and Brown followed him to that label, where he was promoted as a [[popular music|pop]] singer.
