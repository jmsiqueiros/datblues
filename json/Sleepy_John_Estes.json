Not long after, Estes accidentally lost the sight in his right eye when a friend threw a rock at him.<ref name=\"allaboutjazz\"/> At the age of 19, while working as a field hand, he began to perform professionally. The venues were mostly local parties and picnics, with the accompaniment of [[Hammie Nixon]], a [[harmonica]] player, and [[Yank Rachell|James \"Yank\" Rachell]], a [[guitarist]] and [[mandolin]] player. He would continue to work on and off with both [[musician]]s for more than fifty years.<ref name=\"7digital\"/>\n\nEstes made his debut as a [[sound recording and reproduction|recording]] artist in [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]], [[Tennessee]] in 1929, at a session organized by [[Ralph Peer]] for [[Victor Records]].<ref name=\"allaboutjazz\"/> He recorded the tracks \"Drop Down Mama\" and \"Someday Baby Blues\" with Nixon in 1935. He later worked with [[Son Bonds]] and Charlie Pickett.<ref name=\"russell\">{{cite book\n| first= Tony\n| last= Russell\n| year= 1997\n| title= The Blues: From Robert Johnson to Robert Cray\n| edition= \n| publisher= Carlton Books Limited\n| location= Dubai\n| isbn= 1-85868-255-X\n| page= 110}}</ref>\nHe later recorded for the [[Decca Records|Decca]] and [[Bluebird Records|Bluebird]] [[record label|labels]], with his last pre-war recording session taking place in 1941.<ref name=\"allaboutjazz\"/> He made a brief return to recording at [[Sun Studio]] in Memphis in 1952, recording \"Runnin' Around\" and \"Rats in My Kitchen\", but otherwise was largely out of the public eye for two decades.\n\nEstes was a fine singer, with a distinctive \"crying\" vocal style. He frequently teamed with more capable musicians, like \"Yank\" Rachell, Hammie Nixon, and the piano player Jab Jones. Estes sounded so much like an old man, even on his early records, that blues revivalists reportedly delayed looking for him because they assumed he would have to be long dead, and because fellow musician [[Big Bill Broonzy]] had written that Estes had died. By the time he was tracked down, by Bob Koester and [[Samuel Charters]] in 1962, he had become completely blind and was living in [[poverty]]. He resumed touring and recording, working with Nixon on tour and on works released on the [[Delmark Records]] label.<ref name=\"russell\"/> His later records are generally considered less interesting than his pre-war output. Estes, Nixon and Rachell appeared at the [[Newport Folk Festival]] in 1964.<ref>[http://www.oldies.com/artist-biography/Sleepy-John-Estes.html Oldies.com biography of Estes]</ref>\n\n[[Bob Dylan]] mentions Estes in the sleeve notes to ''[[Bringing It All Back Home]]'' (1965).<ref>[http://www.john-meekings.co.uk/jestes.html Blues fansite observation&nbsp;\u2013 accessed February 2008]</ref>\n\nMany of Estes' original songs were based on events in his own life or on people he knew from his home town of Brownsville, Tennessee, such as the local lawyer (\"Lawyer Clark Blues\"), local auto mechanic (\"Vassie Williams' Blues\"), or an amorously inclined teenage girl (\"Little Laura Blues\").<ref name=\"russell\"/> \"Lawyer Clark Blues\" referenced the lawyer, and later judge and senator, Hugh L. Clarke. Clarke and his family lived in Brownsville, and according to the song let Estes 'off the hook' for an offense.\n\nHe also dispensed advice on agricultural matters (\"Working Man Blues\") and chronicled his own attempt to reach a recording studio for a session by hopping a freight train (\"Special Agent (Railroad Police Blues)\"). His [[lyrics]] combined keen observation with an ability to turn an effective phrase.<ref name=ChartersShowersOfRain>{{cite book\n | last       = Charters\n | first      = Samuel\n | title      = Sweet As the Showers of Rain\n | year       = \n | publisher  = Oak Publications\n | pages      = 68\u201382\n | chapter    = \n | isbn       = \n}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal\n  | first = Samuel\n  | last = Charters\n  | title = Sleepy John Estes, 1929\u20131940, ''liner notes\n  | postscript = <!--None-->}}\n</ref>\n\nSome accounts attribute his nickname \"''Sleepy''\" to a [[blood pressure]] disorder and/or [[narcolepsy]].
