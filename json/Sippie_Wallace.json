Her early career in local tent shows gained her the billing \"The Texas Nightingale\". Between 1923 and 1927, she recorded over 40 songs for [[Okeh Records]], many written by herself or her brothers, [[George W. Thomas|George]] and [[Hersal Thomas]].<ref>Santelli, Robert. ''The Big Book of Blues'', Penguin Books, pg. 486, (2001) - ISBN 0-14-100145-3</ref> Her accompanists included [[Louis Armstrong]], [[Johnny Dodds]], [[Sidney Bechet]], [[King Oliver]], and [[Clarence Williams (musician)|Clarence Williams]]. Among the top female blues vocalists of her era, Wallace ranked with [[Ma Rainey]], [[Ida Cox]], [[Alberta Hunter]], and [[Bessie Smith]].\n\nIn the 1930s, she left show business to become a church organist, singer, and choir director in [[Detroit, Michigan|Detroit]], and performed secular music only sporadically until the 1960s, when she resumed her career. Wallace was nominated for a [[Grammy Award]] in 1982, and was inducted into the [[Michigan Women's Hall of Fame]] in 1993.<ref>[http://hall.michiganwomenshalloffame.org/ Michigan Women's Hall of Fame]</ref>\n\n==Biography==\nWallace was born in [[Plum Bayou]], [[Arkansas]], one of 13 children, and later moved with her family as a child to [[Houston]], [[Texas]].<ref>Gates, Professor Henry Louis. ''Africana: The Encyclopedia of the African and African American Experience'', Basic Civitas Books, page 1956, (1999) - ISBN 0-465-00071-1</ref> In her youth Wallace sang and played the [[piano]] in Shiloh Baptist Church, where her father was a [[deacon]], but in the evenings the children took to sneaking out to tent shows. By her mid-teens, they were playing in those tent shows. By performing in the various Texas shows, she built a solid following as a spirited blues singer. {{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}\n\nWallace came from a musical family: her brother [[George W. Thomas]] became a notable [[pianist]], [[bandleader]], [[composer]], and [[music publisher (sheet music)|music publisher]]; her other brother [[Hersal Thomas]] was a [[pianist]] and [[composer]]; and her niece (George's daughter) [[Hociel Thomas]] was a [[pianist]] and [[composer]]. {{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}\n\n==Marriage==\nIn 1915 Wallace moved to [[New Orleans, Louisiana]] with brother Hersal; two years later she married Matt Wallace, and changed her name.\n\n==Career==\nAfter following her brothers to [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]] in 1923, Wallace worked her way into the city's bustling jazz scene. Her reputation led to a recording contract with [[Okeh Records]] in 1923. Wallace's first recorded songs, \"Shorty George\" and \"Up the Country Blues\", the former written with her brother George, sold well enough to make Wallace a blues star in the early 1920s.<ref>Santelli, Robert. ''The Big Book of Blues'' (2001), page 486</ref> Other successful recordings followed, including \"Special Delivery Blues\" (with [[Louis Armstrong]]), \"Bedroom Blues\" (written by George and Hersal Thomas), and \"I'm a Mighty Tight Woman\". Her younger brother Hersal died of food poisoning in 1926 at age 16.\n\nWallace moved to [[Detroit, Michigan|Detroit]] in 1929. Her husband Matt and brother George both died in 1936. Wallace for some 40 years was a singer and [[Organ (music)|organ]] player at the Leland Baptist Church in [[Detroit, Michigan|Detroit]]. [[Mercury Records]] reissued \"Bedroom Blues\" in 1945. Aside from an occasional performance or recording date, Wallace did little in the blues until she launched a comeback in 1966 after her longtime friend [[Victoria Spivey]] coaxed her out of retirement and on the folk and blues festival circuit.\n\nIn 1966 Wallace recorded an album on Halloween night, [[Copenhagen, Denmark]], ''Women Be Wise'', with [[Roosevelt Sykes]] and [[Little Brother Montgomery]] sharing the piano stool.<ref>[http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/discography/index.jsp?pid=1438&aid=82143 Billboard: Women Be Wise]</ref> Another 1966 album ''Sings the Blues'', on the latter song, Wallace accompanied herself on piano; otherwise she is backed by either [[Roosevelt Sykes]] or [[Little Brother Montgomery]] on piano. Includes Wallace's signature song, \"Women Be Wise\", \"Don't Advertise Your Man\". The album helped inspire blues-pop singer [[Bonnie Raitt]] to take up the blues in the late 1960.<ref>Dicaire, David. ''Blues Singers: Biographies of 50 Legendary Artists of the Early 20th Century'', McFarland & Company, page 204, (1999) - ISBN 0-7864-0606-2</ref> In 1971 Raitt recorded a rendition of Sippie Wallace's \"Women Be Wise\" on her self-titled album ''Bonnie Raitt''. Wallace toured and recorded with Raitt in the 1970s and 1980s, while continuing to perform on her own.<ref>[http://www.allaboutjazz.com/php/musician.php?id=11142 All About Jazz: Sippie Wallace]</ref> The bond between Wallace and Raitt helped bridge the gap between two generations of blues queens.\n\nWallace recorded on [[Louis Armstrong]] album, ''Louis Armstrong and the Blues Singers'' (1966), singing \"A Jealous Woman Like Me\", \"Special Delivery Blues\", \"Jack O'Diamond Blues\", \"The Mail Train Blues\" and \"I Feel Good\". Wallace also recorded an album of old blues standards with her friend [[Victoria Spivey]], called ''Sippie Wallace and Victoria Spivey'', which came out in 1970 on Spivey's own self-named label. In 1981, Wallace recorded an album ''Sippie'' for [[Atlantic Records]], which earned a her a 1983 [[Grammy]] nomination,<ref>[http://theenvelope.latimes.com/factsheets/awardsdb/env-awards-db-search,0,7169155.htmlstory?searchtype=all&query=Sippie&x=9&y=7 Grammy Awards Database]</ref> and also won the 1982 [[W. C. Handy Award]] for Best Blues Album of the Year.<ref>[http://www.blues.org/handys/pastyears.php4?YearId=24 The Blues Foundation 1982]</ref> Wallace's backup group on were pianist Jim Dapogny's Chicago Jazz Band, consisting of cornetist Paul Klinger, trombonist Bob Smith and Russ Whitman and Peter Ferran on reeds.\n\nIn 1966 and 1967 she appeared at the [[Newport Folk Festival]], toured Europe with the [[American Folk Blues Festival]], e.g. [[Copenhagen, Denmark]] in 1966, the [[Chicago Blues Festival]], 1967, the [[Ann Arbor Blues Festival]], 1972, and appeared at [[Lincoln Center]] in [[New York]], 1977. She played herself in the documentary ''Jammin' with the Blues Greats'' (1982).<ref>[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0298942/ imdb: \"Jammin' with the Blues Greats\"]</ref>\n\nOn July 22, 1982 at the Montreux Jazz Festival, Sippie shared the stage with the King of the Blues, B.B. King, which was filmed and later broadcast.\n\nThen in [[Ann Arbor, Michigan]] she got together with German [[boogie woogie]] pianist [[Axel Zwingenberger]], with whom she recorded a studio album in 1983. Wallace included many of her own groundbreaking compositions as well as other classic blues songs, on his album, ''And the Friends of Boogie, Vol. 1: Sippie Wallace'', released in 1984. In 1984 she traveled to Germany to tour with Zwingenberger, where they also recorded the only complete live album she ever did: ''An Evening With Sippie Wallace'' for Vagabond Records.\n\n==Death==\nIn March 1986, following a concert in [[Germany]] at [[Burghausen, Alt\u00f6tting|Burghausen]] Jazz Festival, she suffered a severe stroke, was hospitalized, returned to the US, and died on her 88th birthday at Sinai Hospital in [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]].<ref>[http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G2-3435000203.html Sippie Wallace Encyclopedia Biography]</ref> She is buried at Trinity Cemetery, [[Detroit]], [[Wayne County, Michigan]].<ref>[http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&GRid=6894516 Trinity Cemetery]</ref>\n\n==Documentary==\nIn 1986, Rhapsody Films and producer Roberta Grossman released ''Sippie Wallace: Blues Singer and Song Writer'', a documentary about Sippie Wallace, who is represented in this film portrait by means of concert footage, interviews, historic rare recordings and photographs.<ref>[http://class.csueastbay.edu/music/MRC/VHS/VHS.htm California State University Video Tape Library: \"Sippie Wallace: Blues Singer and Song Writer\"]</ref>\n\n==Selective discography==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Year\n!Title\n!Genre\n!Label\n|-\n|1982\n|''Sippie''\n|Blues\n|Atlantic\n|-\n|1970\n|''Sippie Wallace and Victoria Spivey''\n|Blues\n|Spivey\n|-\n|1966\n|''Sings the Blues''\n|Blues\n|Storyville\n|-\n|1966\n|''Women Be Wise''\n|Blues\n|Alligator\n|-\n|1923\n|''1923-1929''\n|Blues\n|Document\n|}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.redhotjazz.com/wallace.html Sippie Wallace on RedHotJazz] - Biography with audio files of some of her early recordings.\n* [http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fwaal Handbook of Texas online biography]\n* [http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=sippie+wallace Videos on YouTube]\n* {{findagrave|6894516}}\n\n{{Michigan Women's Hall of Fame}}\n\n{{Authority control|VIAF=69117111}}\n{{Persondata <!-- Metadata: see [[Wikipedia:Persondata]]. -->\n| NAME              =Thomas, Beulah\n| ALTERNATIVE NAMES =Wallace, Sippie\n| SHORT DESCRIPTION =American blues and jazz singer\n| DATE OF BIRTH     =November 1, 1898\n| PLACE OF BIRTH    =[[Houston]], [[Texas]], United States\n| DATE OF DEATH     =November 1, 1986\n| PLACE OF DEATH    =[[Detroit]], [[Michigan]], United States\n}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Wallace, Sippie}}\n[[Category:Classic female blues singers]]\n[[Category:1898 births]]\n[[Category:1986 deaths]]\n[[Category:African-American musicians]]\n[[Category:American blues singers]]\n[[Category:American female singers]]\n[[Category:Blues Hall of Fame inductees]]\n[[Category:Deaths from stroke]]\n[[Category:American singer-songwriters]]\n[[Category:Disease-related deaths in Michigan]]\n[[Category:Musicians from Houston, Texas]]"}]}}}}
