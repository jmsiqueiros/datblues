Over time he became skilled in pre-Piedmont finger picking and [[slide guitar]] techniques. He continued working on the farm until he was shot in a fight, as a result of which he lost his right leg and began working full-time as a [[musician]].<ref name=\"piedmont\"/> In 1923 he moved to [[Atlanta, Georgia]] and began playing on street corners, but also served a period in [[prison]] for [[rum-running|bootleg]]ging [[Distilled beverage|liquor]].  \n\nIn 1926, he was heard playing on the streets of Atlanta and was [[sound recording and reproduction|recorded]] for the first time by [[Columbia Records]].  They released \"New Prison Blues\", written while in prison and the first country blues to be issued on the label.<ref>[[Samuel Charters]]. ''[[The Country Blues (book)|The Country Blues]]''. New York: [[Da Capo Press]], 1975, p.148.</ref> Over the next three years Columbia recorded him on several occasions, often accompanied by a small group including Henry Williams on guitar and [[Eddie Anthony]] on [[fiddle]].  His recorded repertoire covered [[ballads]], [[ragtime]], and [[jazz]], as well as blues.\n\nHowell continued to play around the Atlanta area for several years, but also began selling bootleg liquor again.  After the mid 1930s he only performed occasionally and, in 1952, his left leg was removed as a result of [[Diabetes mellitus|diabetes]], confining him to a [[wheelchair]]. A single track by Howell was issued on ''[[The Country Blues]]'' in 1959, and in 1963 he was \"rediscovered\" in dire poverty in Atlanta by folklorist and field researcher [[George Mitchell (music historian)|George Mitchell]] and his high-school class-mate, Roger Brown. They recorded Howell at the age of 75 with the results issued on LP by [[Testament Records (USA)|Testament Records]] thirty-four years after his last recorded sessions, one of Mitchell's first field-recording sessions in his long career.<ref name=\"amg\">[{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p219143/biography|pure_url=yes}} Allmusic biography]</ref>  Howell died in Atlanta in 1966.<ref name=\"amg\"/>\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of blues musicians]]\n*[[List of Piedmont blues musicians]]\n*[[List of Country blues musicians]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.cascadeblues.org/History/JoshuaHowell.htm  Cascadeblues.org Biography]\n*[http://toto.lib.unca.edu/sounds/piedmontblues/howell.html East Coast Piedmont Blues website - Howell bio]\n*[http://www.wirz.de/music/howell.htm Illustrated Peg Leg Howell discography]\n\n{{Authority control|VIAF=22330128}}\n\n{{Persondata <!-- Metadata: see [[Wikipedia:Persondata]]. -->\n| NAME              = Howell, Joshua Barnes\n| ALTERNATIVE NAMES = Howell, Peg Leg\n| SHORT DESCRIPTION = [[African American]] [[blues]] singer and guitarist\n| DATE OF BIRTH     = March 5, 1888\n| PLACE OF BIRTH    = [[Eatonton, Georgia]], United States\n| DATE OF DEATH     = August 11, 1966\n| PLACE OF DEATH    = [[Atlanta, Georgia]], United States\n}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Howell, Peg Leg}}\n[[Category:1888 births]]\n[[Category:1966 deaths]]\n[[Category:African-American musicians]]\n[[Category:American blues guitarists]]\n[[Category:American blues singers]]\n[[Category:Piedmont blues musicians]]\n[[Category:Country blues musicians]]"}]}}}}
