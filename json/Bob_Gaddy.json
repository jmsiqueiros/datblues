He is best remembered for his recordings of \"Operator\" and \"Rip and Run,\" and musical work he undertook with [[Larry Dale]], [[Wild Jimmy Spruill]], [[Sonny Terry]] and [[Brownie McGhee]].<ref name=\"Dead\">{{cite web|author=Doc Rock |url=http://thedeadrockstarsclub.com/1996.html |title=The Dead Rock Stars Club 1996 - 1997 |publisher=Thedeadrockstarsclub.com |date= |accessdate=2014-01-25}}</ref>\n\n==Biography==\nGaddy was born in [[Vivian, West Virginia]], a small town based around [[coal mining]].<ref name=\"AMG\"/><ref name=\"NYT\"/> He learned to play the piano at a young age, both playing and singing in his local church. In 1943 he was [[Conscription|conscripted]] and served in the [[United States Navy|Navy]], being stationed in [[California]].  He progressed from learning the [[blues]] and, using his [[gospel music|gospel]] background, graduated towards the [[boogie-woogie]] playing style.<ref name=\"NYT\"/> \n\nHe played in blues [[nightclub|clubs]] in [[Oakland, California|Oakland]] and [[San Francisco]], but after [[World War II]] finished he relocated to [[New York City|New York]] in 1946. Gaddy later commented \"I came to New York just to visit, because I was on my way to the West Coast. Somehow or other, I just got hooked on it. New York got into my system and I've been stuck here ever since.\"<ref name=\"NYT\"/>  \n\nHe found work as a blues pianist, and in the late 1940s Gaddy provided accompaniment to both [[Brownie McGhee]] and [[Sonny Terry]]. He later backed [[Larry Dale]], and befriended [[Champion Jack Dupree]].  Dupree penned \"Operator\" for Gaddy, one of his best selling numbers.<ref name=\"NYT\"/> Gaddy recorded firstly for Jackson Records with his debut [[single (music)|single]] being \"Bicycle Boogie\" in 1952. Gaddy later spent time with the Jax, [[Dot Records|Dot]] and Harlem record labels, before joining [[Hy Weiss]]' Old Town Records in 1956. It was here that Gaddy had his most commercially successful period, particularly with \"I Love My Baby,\" \"Paper Lady,\" and \"Rip and Run.\" His earlier recordings often had McGhee in the [[recording studio]] with Gaddy, although his Old Town recordings utilised the [[guitarist]]s [[Wild Jimmy Spruill|Jimmy Spruill]] and Joe Ruffin, plus [[saxophone|saxophonist]] Jimmy Wright.<ref name=\"AMG\"/> \n\nGaddy ceased his [[sound recording and reproduction|recording]] activities around 1960.  However, along with his long time friend Larry Dale, Gaddy remained a mainstay of the ongoing New York blues scene.<ref name=\"AMG\">{{cite web |url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p173355/biography|pure_url=yes}} |title=Bob Gaddy|author=Dahl, Bill |publisher=[[Allmusic]] |accessdate=May 22, 2010}}</ref>  \n\nIn April 1988, Gaddy, Dale and Spruill reunited to play at the Tramps nightclub in New York.<ref name=\"NYT\">{{cite web|author=Jon Pareles |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1988/04/29/arts/pop-jazz-new-york-rockers-singing-the-blues-loudly-and-clearly.html |title=POP/JAZZ; New York Rockers Singing the Blues Loudly and Clearly - New York Times |location=New York City |publisher=Nytimes.com |date=1988-04-29 |accessdate=2014-01-25}}</ref>\n\nBob Gaddy died of [[lung cancer]] in [[the Bronx]], New York in July 1997, at the age of 73.<ref name=\"Dead\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cdbaby.com/cd/mojobluesband2 |title=Mojo Blues Band &#124; Blues Parade 2000 &#124; CD Baby Music Store |publisher=Cdbaby.com |date= |accessdate=2014-01-25}}</ref>\n\n==Discography==\n===Singles===\n*\"I (Believe You Got A Sidekick)\" / \"Bicycle Boogie\" (1952) - Jackson Records - Bob Gaddy & His Alley Cats\n*\"No Help Wanted\" / \"Little Girl's Boogie\" (1953) - Jax Records - Bob Gaddy & His Alley Cats\n*\"Evil Man Blues\" / \"Doctor Gaddy's Blues\" (1954) - Dot Records - Doctor Gaddy & His Orchestra\n*\"Blues Has Walked in My Room\" / \"Slow Down Baby\" (1955) - Harlem Records - Doctor Gaddy & His Keys\n*\"Operator\" / \"I Love My Baby\" (1956) - Old Town Records - Doctor Gaddy & His Keys\n*\"Paper Lady\" / \"Out Of My Name\" (1957) - Old Town Records - Doctor Gaddy & His Keys\n*\"Woe Woe Is Me\" / \"Rip and Run\" (1958) - Old Town Records - Doctor Gaddy & His Keys\n*\"Take My Advice\" / \"You Are the One\" (1959) - Old Town Records\n*\"Till The Day I Die\"/ \"I'll Go My Way\" (1959) - Old Town Records<ref name=\"Wirz\"/>\n\n===Compilation albums===\n*''Rip and Run'' (1986) - [[Ace Records (US)|Ace]]\n*''Bob Gaddy & Friends: Bicycle Boogie 1947 - 1960'' (1987) - Moonshine\n*''Harlem Blues Operator'' (1995) - Ace<ref name=\"NYT\"/><ref name=\"Wirz\">{{cite web|url=http://www.wirz.de/music/dalefrm.htm|title=Larry Dale discography|publisher=Wirz.de|accessdate=2014-01-25}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/bob-gaddy-mn0000061513/discography |title=Bob Gaddy &#124; Discography |publisher=AllMusic |date=1924-02-04 |accessdate=2014-01-25}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Biography}}\n*[[List of East Coast blues musicians]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.wirz.de/music/gaddy.htm Illustrated Bob Gaddy discography]\n\n{{Authority control|VIAF=64195731}}\n{{Persondata<!-- Metadata: see [[Wikipedia:Persondata]] -->\n| NAME              =Gaddy, Bob\n| ALTERNATIVE NAMES =\n| SHORT DESCRIPTION =[[United States|American]] [[East Coast blues]] and [[rhythm and blues]] pianist, singer and songwriter\n| DATE OF BIRTH     =February 4, 1924\n| PLACE OF BIRTH    =Vivian, [[West Virginia]], United States\n| DATE OF DEATH     =July 24, 1997\n| PLACE OF DEATH    =[[The Bronx]], [[New York City|New York]], United States\n}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Gaddy, Bob}}\n[[Category:1924 births]]\n[[Category:1997 deaths]]\n[[Category:American blues pianists]]\n[[Category:Songwriters from West Virginia]]\n[[Category:American male singers]]\n[[Category:American blues singers]]\n[[Category:American rhythm and blues musicians]]\n[[Category:Deaths from lung cancer]]\n[[Category:Cancer deaths in New York]]\n[[Category:East Coast blues musicians]]\n[[Category:Musicians from West Virginia]]"}]}}}}
