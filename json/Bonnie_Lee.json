Instead she did later tour with the Famous Georgia Minstrels, meeting both [[Clarence \"Gatemouth\" Brown]] and [[Big Mama Thornton]].<ref name=\"Tribune\"/><ref name=\"AMG\"/>\n\nIn 1958 she moved to [[Chicago]], and chose the [[stage name]] of Bonnie Lee, working as both a [[dancer]] and singer.  Two years later she signed a [[recording contract]] with [[J. Mayo Williams]]' Ebony Records [[record label|label]]. The downside was Williams' insistence on her being billed as Bonnie \"Bombshell\" Lane on her first [[single (music)|single]], \"Sad and Evil Woman.\" It was a name she disliked but, after the single failed to sell, she returned to the Chicago [[jazz]] and blues [[nightclub]]s. She was later billed as Bonnie Lee Murray, using her then husband's surname.<ref name=\"Tribune\"/>\n\nIn 1967 Lee first appeared on the bill with the [[pianist]] [[Sunnyland Slim]], and their working arrangement included residencies at a number of Chicago clubs. This led her, at the end of the 1970s, to release further singles via the Slim owned record label, Airway  Records.<ref name=\"AMG\"/> After suffering health problems at the end of that decade, Lee then enjoyed a long professional partnership with [[Willie Kent]]. For many years the combination of Lee backed by Willie Kent and the Gents, became a regular feature in B.L.U.E.S., a noted Chicago club. There she sang her most famous numbers; \"I\u2019m Good\" and \"[[Need Your Love So Bad]].\"<ref name=\"Tribune\">{{cite web |url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/2006/sep/13/news/chi-0609130082sep13|title=Bonnie Lee: 1931 - 2006|author=Jensen, Trevor |publisher=[[Chicago Tribune]] |accessdate=January 19, 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn 1982, and partnered with [[Zora Young]] and [[Big Time Sarah]] as 'Blues with the Girls', Lee toured [[Europe]] and cut a joint album in [[Paris]], [[France]].<ref name=\"russell\">{{cite book\n| first= Tony\n| last= Russell\n| year= 1997\n| title= The Blues: From Robert Johnson to Robert Cray\n| edition= \n| publisher= Carlton Books Limited \n| location= Dubai\n| page= 195\n| isbn= 1-85868-255-X}}</ref> In 1992 Lee guested on [[Magic Slim]]'s album, ''44 Blues,'' with [[John Primer]].
