In 1956 it was noted that he appeared at 342 shows. King continues to appear at 100 shows a year.\n\nOver the years, King has developed one of the world's most identifiable guitar styles. He borrowed from [[Blind Lemon Jefferson]], [[T-Bone Walker]] and others, integrating his precise and complex vocal-like string bends and his left hand vibrato, both of which have become indispensable components of rock guitarists' vocabulary. His economy and  phrasing has been a model for thousands of players.<ref name=AllmusicBio/> King has mixed [[blues]], [[jazz]], [[swing music|swing]], mainstream pop and [[jump blues|jump]] into a unique sound. In King's words, \"When I sing, I play in my mind; the minute I stop singing orally, I start to sing by playing [[Lucille (guitar)|Lucille]].\"\n\n==Early life==\nKing was born in a cabin on a cotton plantation outside of [[Berclair, Mississippi]], to Albert King and Nora Ella Farr on September 16, 1925. Although, King considers the nearby city of [[Indianola, MS]] to be his home. In 1930, his father left the family, and his mother married another man. King was raised by his maternal grandmother Elnora Farr in [[Kilmichael, Mississippi]].<ref name=\"jazz\"/>\n\nAs a kid, King sang in the gospel choir at Elkhorn Baptist Church in Kilmichael. It seems that at the age of 12, he purchased his first guitar for $15.00,<ref name=\"jazz\"/> although another source indicates he was given his first guitar by [[Bukka White]], his mother's first cousin (King's grandmother and White's mother were sisters).<ref>{{cite book |title=The B.B.

White took him in for the next ten months.<ref name=\"jazz\"/> However, King shortly returned to Mississippi, where he decided to prepare himself better for the next visit, and returned to [[West Memphis, Arkansas]], two years later in 1948. He performed on Sonny Boy Williamson's radio program on [[KWEM Radio|KWEM]] in West Memphis, where he began to develop an audience. King's appearances led to steady engagements at the Sixteenth Avenue Grill in West Memphis and later to a ten-minute spot on the Memphis radio station [[WDIA]]. ''King's Spot'' became so popular, it was expanded and became the ''Sepia Swing Club''.\n\nInitially he worked at WDIA as a singer and disc jockey, gaining the nickname '''[[Beale Street]] Blues Boy''', which was later shortened to '''Blues Boy''' and finally to ''B.B.''<ref>''B.B.'' is normally written with periods, but no space between the letters.</ref><ref>''History of Rock & Roll''.

Many of King's early recordings were produced by [[Sam Phillips]], who later founded [[Sun Records]]. Before his RPM contract, King had debuted on [[Bullet Records]] by issuing the single \"Miss Martha King\" (1949), which did not chart well. \"My very first recordings [in 1949] were for a company out of Nashville called Bullet, the Bullet Record Transcription company,\" King recalls. \"I had horns that very first session. I had [[Phineas Newborn]] on piano; his father played drums, and his brother, [[Calvin Newborn|Calvin]], played guitar with me. I had [[Tuff Green]] on bass, [[Ben Branch]] on tenor sax, his brother, Thomas Branch, on trumpet, and a lady trombone player. The Newborn family were the house band at the famous Plantation Inn in West Memphis.\"<ref>[http://www.bluesaccess.com/No_37/bb_talk.html ''Blues Access'' Interview] by Wayne Robins, Spring 1999.

King Review, under the leadership of Millard Lee. The band initially consisted of Calvin Owens and Kenneth Sands (trumpet), Lawrence Burdin (alto saxophone), [[George Coleman]] (tenor saxophone),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allaboutjazz.com/php/article.php?id=1078 |title=George Coleman: This Gentleman can PLAY |publisher=All About Jazz |accessdate=February 17, 2010}}</ref> [[Floyd Newman]] (baritone saxophone), Millard Lee (piano), [[George Joyner]] (bass) and Earl Forest and Ted Curry (drums). Onzie Horne was a trained musician elicited as an arranger to assist King with his compositions. By his own admission, he cannot play chords well<ref>''U2 Rattle and Hum'' DVD, 1988</ref> and always relies on [[improvisation]]. This was followed by tours across the USA with performances in major theaters in cities such as Washington, D.C., Chicago, Los Angeles, Detroit and St. Louis, as well as numerous gigs in small clubs and [[juke joint]]s of the southern US states.\n\nIn the winter of 1949, King played at a dance hall in [[Twist, Arkansas]]. In order to heat the hall, a barrel half-filled with kerosene was lit, a fairly common practice at the time. During a performance, two men began to fight, knocking over the burning barrel and sending burning fuel across the floor. The hall burst into flames, which triggered an evacuation. Once outside, King realized that he had left his guitar inside the burning building. He entered the blaze to retrieve his beloved instrument, a Gibson hollow electric. The next day, King learned that the two men were fighting over a woman named Lucille. King named that first guitar Lucille, as well as every one he owned since that experience, as a reminder never again to do something as stupid as run into a burning building for a replaceable guitar.\n\nKing meanwhile toured the entire \"[[Chitlin' circuit]]\" and 1956 became a record-breaking year, with 342 concerts booked. The same year he founded his own record label, Blues Boys Kingdom, with headquarters at Beale Street in Memphis. There, among other projects, he produced artists such as Millard Lee and Levi Seabury.\n\nIn the 1950s, B.B. King became one of the most important names in [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]] music, amassing an impressive list of hits including \"[[3&nbsp;O'Clock Blues]]\",<ref name=pc4>{{Pop Chronicles|4|4}}</ref> \"You Know I Love You,\" \"Woke Up This Morning,\" \"Please Love Me,\" \"When My Heart Beats like a Hammer,\" \"Whole Lotta Love,\" \"You Upset Me Baby,\" \"[[Every Day I Have the Blues]]\", \"Sneakin' Around,\" \"Ten Long Years,\" \"Bad Luck,\" \"[[Sweet Little Angel]]\", \"On My Word of Honor,\" and \"Please Accept My Love.\" King was extremely busy during this period and made 342 appearances and 3 recording sessions in 1956 alone. In 1962, King signed to [[ABC-Paramount Records]], which was later absorbed into [[MCA Records]], and this hence into his current label, [[Geffen Records]]. In November 1964, King recorded the ''[[Live at the Regal]]'' album at the [[Regal Theater, South Side (Chicago)|Regal Theater]] in Chicago, Illinois.\n\nKing won a 1970 [[Grammy Award]] for the song \"[[The Thrill Is Gone]]\";<ref>Rees, Dafydd & Crampton, Luke (1991). ''Rock Movers & Shakers'', ABC-CLIO, p.287. ISBN 0-87436-661-5</ref> his version became a hit on both the pop and R&B [[record chart|charts]], which was rare during that time for an R&B artist. It also gained the number 183 spot in ''Rolling Stone'' magazine's ''[[500 Greatest Songs of All Time]]''. He gained further visibility among rock audiences as an opening act on [[The Rolling Stones]]' [[The Rolling Stones American Tour 1969|1969 American Tour]]. King's mainstream success continued throughout the 1970s with songs like \"To Know You is to Love You\" and \"I Like to Live the Love\".\n\nKing was inducted into the [[Blues Hall of Fame]] in 1980, and into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 1987. In 2004 he was awarded the international [[Polar Music Prize]], given to artists \"in recognition of exceptional achievements in the creation and advancement of music.\"<ref name=\"Polar Music Prize\">[http://www.polarmusicprize.se/2/ Polar Music Prize Winners]{{Dead link|date=February 2010}}</ref>\n\n[[File:BBKing07.JPG|left|thumb|B.B. King in concert in France 1989]]\nFrom the 1980s onward he has continued to maintain a highly visible and active career, appearing on numerous television shows and performing 300 nights a year. In 1988, King reached a new generation of fans with the single \"[[When Love Comes to Town]]\", a collaborative effort between King and the Irish band [[U2]] on their ''[[Rattle and Hum]]'' album. Also that year King played for the [[1988 Republican National Convention]] at the behest of [[Lee Atwater]], chairman of the Republican Party. King has remained friendly with the Bush Family ever since and in 1990 was awarded the Presidential Medal of the Arts by [[George H.W. Bush]] and the [[Medal of Freedom]] by [[George W. Bush]] in 2008. In 2000, King teamed up with guitarist [[Eric Clapton]] to record ''[[Riding with the King (B.B. King and Eric Clapton album)|Riding With the King]]''. In 1998, King appeared in ''[[Blues Brothers 2000|The Blues Brothers 2000]]'', playing the part of the lead singer of the Louisiana Gator Boys, along with Clapton, [[Dr. John]], [[Koko Taylor]] and [[Bo Diddley]].\n\n===2006\u2013present: farewell tour and later activities===\nOn 2006, King went on a \"farewell\" world tour, although he has been active ever since it ended. partly supported by Northern Irish guitarist [[Gary Moore]], with whom King had previously toured and recorded, including the song \"[[Since I Met You Baby (song)|Since I Met You Baby]]\". It started in the [[UK]], and continued with performances in the [[Montreux Jazz Festival]] and in Z\u00fcrich at the Blues at Sunset. During his show in Montreux at the Stravinski Hall he jammed with [[Joe Sample]], [[Randy Crawford]], [[David Sanborn]], [[Gladys Knight]], Lella James, Andre Beeka, Earl Thomas, [[Stanley Clarke]], [[John McLaughlin (musician)|John McLaughlin]], [[Barbara Hendricks]] and [[George Duke]]. The European leg of the Farewell Tour ended in Luxembourg on September 19, 2006, at the [[D'Coque]] Arena (support act: [[Todd Sharpville]]). In November and December, King played six times in Brazil.\n\nIn June 2006, King was present at a memorial of his first radio broadcast at the Three Deuces Building in [[Greenwood, Mississippi]], where an official marker of the [[Mississippi Blues Trail]] was erected.
