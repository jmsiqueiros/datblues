She sometimes used the [[pseudonym]]s of Bessie Williams (although she was not alone in using this name), Jane White, Dixie Gray, Rosa Green and Mazie Leroy.<ref name=\"AMG\"/> Brown was active as a recording artist from 1923 to the mid-1930s. Her best known tracks were \"I Wanna Jazz Some More\" and \"[[It's De-Lovely]]\". Little is known of her life outside of her music.\n\n==Career==\nThe bulk of Brown's recording work occurred in 1923 and 1924, although in the 1930s she waxed one track, with [[Les Brown (bandleader)|Les Brown]]'s Band of Renown. It was a working of [[Cole Porter]]'s song, \"[[It's De-Lovely]]\".<ref name=\"AMG\"/>\n\nThe title of her 1924 track, \"I Wanna Jazz Some More\", is misleading.  The word 'jazz' was used as a euphemism for bodily fluid, and not as a reference to the musical art form.  In the manner of the time, several of Brown's songs used [[Innuendo|sexual innuendo]], but not all her tracks were similarly slanted.  It is also probable that contractual agreements with [[record label]]s saw her record elsewhere under a number of assumed names, some of which are difficult to verify.<ref name=\"AMG\"/>\n\nHer debut session produced the songs \"Evil Blues\" and \"Mean Eyes (Too Late Blues)\".  The former track had the notation accompanied by Rickett Stars, almost certainly another stage name. Her main musical partner was the [[songwriter]] LeRoy Morton, who also acted as manager for [[Clara Smith]]. On the [[Okeh Records|Okeh]] label, Brown and Morton recorded \"He's Never Gonna Throw Me Down\" and \"Keep on Going\". One of her later recording pseudonyms, Mazie Leroy, might have connections to the association with him.<ref name=\"AMG\">{{cite web |first= |last= |url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p543366/biography|pure_url=yes}} |title=Biography by Eugene Chadbourne |publisher=Allmusic.com |accessdate=September 30, 2011}}</ref> As was becoming more common then, much of Brown's material came via the music publishing arm of her record label.  A later session saw her record \"Family Skeleton Blues\", one of her more beguiling sides.<ref name=\"AMG\"/> Amongst her accompanists was [[James \"Bubber\" Miley]].<ref>{{cite book\n| first= A.
