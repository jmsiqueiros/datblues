(1981): ''Blues Who's Who''. New York, Da Capo Press, pp. 594-595</ref> was an [[United States|American]] [[blues]] singer, [[mandolin]] player and guitarist, significant as one of the first of the new generation of [[electric blues]] artists to record in Chicago after the Second World War, and as one of the few mandolin players to have been active in blues music in the post-war era.  His nickname, \"Man\", came from his use of the mandolin.\n\n==Life and career==\nYoung was born in [[Vicksburg, Mississippi|Vicksburg]], Mississippi,<ref name=\"russell\">{{cite book\n| first= Tony\n| last= Russell\n| year= 1997\n| title= The Blues - From Robert Johnson to Robert Cray\n| edition= \n| publisher=Carlton Books Limited \n| location= Dubai\n| pages= 194\n| isbn= 1-85868-255-X}}</ref> and played in string bands in Mississippi in the 1930s.  He also claimed to have worked with [[Sleepy John Estes]] in Tennessee before moving to Chicago in 1940.  By 1943 he was working with [[Sonny Boy Williamson I|John Lee \"Sonny Boy\" Williamson]] and [[Muddy Waters]] and in the late 1940s he became a regular player on [[Maxwell Street]], often with his cousin, guitarist [[Johnny Williams (blues musician)|Johnny Williams]], as well as playing in clubs with Williams and [[Little Walter]].  His first recording was made in 1947 for the Ora Nelle label and featured Young singing \"Money Taking Woman\" on the [[A-side and B-side|A-side]], accompanied by Williams, who sang \"Worried Man Blues\" on the [[A-side and B-side|B-side]].  A second session in late 1948, with Young and Williams joined by [[Snooky Pryor]] on [[harmonica]], resulted in a single being released under the name \"Man Young\" on the Planet label.  A further session for the [[J.O.B. Records|J.O.B.]] label was unissued, and after a session playing guitar behind Snooky Pryor for [[Vee-Jay]] Young retired from performance for a time in the 1950s.<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://hubcap.clemson.edu/~campber/planetmarvel.html|title=Planet and Marvel|publisher=hubcap.clemson.edu|accessdate=2008-05-13}}</ref><ref>Rowe, M. (1981): ''Chicago Blues: the city and the music'', New York: Da Capo Press</ref>\n\nThe rise of white interest in blues in the early 1960s resulted in Young emerging from retirement in 1963, and he recorded for a number of labels including [[Vanguard Records|Vanguard]], [[Testament Records (USA)|Testament]], [[Arhoolie Records|Arhoolie]] and [[Blue Horizon]] in the 1960s and early 1970s.<ref>Leadbitter, M., Fancourt, L. and Pelletier, P.
