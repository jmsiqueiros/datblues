He has been called \"the father of modern blues harp\". While in his teens he joined [[Yank Rachell]] and [[Sleepy John Estes]] playing with them in Tennessee and [[Arkansas]], and in 1934 settled in [[Chicago]].<ref name=\"billboard\"/>\n\n===Early recordings===\nSonny first recorded for [[Bluebird Records]] in 1937 and his first recording, \"[[Good Morning, School Girl]]\", became a [[Standard (music)|standard]].<ref name=\"billboard\"/>  He was hugely popular among black audiences throughout the southern United States as well as in the midwestern industrial cities such as [[Detroit]] and his home base in Chicago, and his name was synonymous with the blues harmonica for the next decade. Other well-known recordings of his include \"[[Sugar Mama Blues]]\", \"Shake the Boogie\", \"You Better Cut That Out\", \"Sloppy Drunk\", \"[[Early in the Morning (Sonny Boy Williamson I song)|Early in the Morning]]\" and \"[[Stop Breaking Down]]\" and \"Hoodoo Hoodoo\" aka \"Hoodoo Man Blues\". In 1947 \"Shake the Boogie\" made #4 on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'''s [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs|Race Records]] chart.<ref name=\"billboard\"/>  Williamson's style influenced a large number of blues harmonica performers, including [[Billy Boy Arnold]], [[Junior Wells]], [[Sonny Terry]], [[Little Walter]], and [[Snooky Pryor]] among many others.  He was the most widely heard and influential blues harmonica player of his generation.  His music was also influential on many of his non-harmonica playing contemporaries and successors, including [[Muddy Waters]] (who had played guitar with Williamson in the mid-1940s) and [[Jimmy Rogers]] (whose first recording in 1946 was as a harmonica player, performing an uncanny imitation of Williamson's style); Rogers later recorded Williamson's songs \"My Little Machine\" and \"Sloppy Drunk\" on [[Chess Records]], and Waters recorded \"Good Morning Little Schoolgirl\" in September 1963 for his Chess ''Folk Singer'' LP and again in the 1970s when he moved to [[Johnny Winter]]'s Blue Sky label on [[Sony Music|CBS]].\n\n===1940s===\nHe was popular enough that by the 1940s, another blues harp player, [[Sonny Boy Williamson II|Aleck/Alex \"Rice\" Miller]], from [[Mississippi]], began also using the name Sonny Boy Williamson. John Lee is said to have objected to this, though no legal action took place, possibly due to the fact that Miller did not release any records during Williamson's lifetime, and that Williamson played mainly around the [[Chicago]] area, while Miller seldom ventured beyond the [[Mississippi Delta]] region until after Williamson's death.  In 1942, John Lee allegedly confronted Miller, but according to Miller's friend and guitarist [[Robert Lockwood]], \"Big Sonny Boy [Miller] chased Little Sonny Boy [Williamson] away from there. He couldn't play with Rice. Rice Miller could play Sonny Boy's stuff better than he could play it!\"<ref>{{citation | last= Shurman |first= Dick |title = liner notes, Sonny Boy Williamson, His Best| year= 1997}}</ref>\n\n===Death and musical legacy===\nWilliamson recorded prolifically both as a bandleader and a sideman over the entire course of his career, mainly for the [[Bluebird Records|Bluebird]] record label. Before Bluebird moved to Chicago, where it eventually became part of RCA Records, many early sessions took place at the [[Leland Tower]], a hotel in [[Aurora, Illinois]]. The top-floor nightclub at the Leland, known as \"The Sky Club\", was used for live big band broadcasts on a local radio station, was utilized during off-hours as a recording studio for Williamson's early sessions, as well as those of other Bluebird artists. \n\nWilliamson's final recording session took place in Chicago in December 1947, backing [[Big Joe Williams]].  On June 1, 1948, John Lee Williamson was killed in a robbery on Chicago's South Side, as he walked home from a performance at The Plantation Club at 31st St. and Giles Ave., a tavern just a block and a half away from his home at 3226 S. Giles. Williamson's final words are reported to have been \"Lord have mercy\".<ref>{{cite book |last= Green |first= Jonathon |title= Famous Last Words |publisher= Kyle Cathie |year= 2002 |isbn=978-1856264655}}</ref>\n\nHis legacy has been somewhat overshadowed in the post-war blues era by the popularity of the musician who appropriated his name, [[Sonny Boy Williamson II|Rice Miller]], who after Williamson's death went on to record many popular blues songs for Chicago's [[Checker Records]] label and others, and toured Europe several times during the 'blues revival' in the early 1960s. \n\nWilliamson is buried at the former site of The Blairs Chapel Church, southwest of Jackson, Tennessee. In 1991, a red granite marker was purchased by fans and family to mark the site of his burial. A Tennessee historical marker, also placed in 1991, indicates the place of his birth and describes his influence on blues music. The historical marker is located south of Jackson on [[Tennessee State Route 18|TN Highway 18]], at the corner of Caldwell Road.\n\n==Studio albums==\n* The Original Sonny Boy (Saga) 2005\n* Bluebird Blues (RCA Victor Europe) 2003\n\n==See also==\n* [[Sonny Boy Williamson II]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.blues.org/halloffame/inductees.php4?YearId=25 Blues Foundation Hall of Fame]\n*[http://www.onthisveryspot.com/search.php?ss=Sonny_Boy_Williamson Sonny Boy Williamson gravesite and historical marker]\n*[http://www.stcelibart.com/StCelibart/Sonny%20Boy.html Sonny Boy<!-- bot-generated title -->] at www.stcelibart.com\n*{{Find a Grave|8395191}}\n\n{{Persondata <!-- Metadata: see [[Wikipedia:Persondata]]. -->\n| NAME              = Williamson, Sonny Boy\n| ALTERNATIVE NAMES = Williamson, John Lee\n| SHORT DESCRIPTION = American blues musician\n| DATE OF BIRTH     = March 30, 1914\n| PLACE OF BIRTH    = [[Jackson, Tennessee]], [[United States]]\n| DATE OF DEATH     = June 1, 1948\n| PLACE OF DEATH    = [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]], United States\n}}\n\n{{Sonny Boy Williamson I}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Williamson 1, Sonny Boy}}\n[[Category:1914 births]]\n[[Category:1948 deaths]]\n[[Category:People from Jackson, Tennessee]]\n[[Category:Harmonica blues musicians]]\n[[Category:Chicago blues musicians]]\n[[Category:Country blues musicians]]\n[[Category:Electric blues musicians]]\n[[Category:American blues musicians]]\n[[Category:American blues harmonica players]]\n[[Category:Murdered musicians]]\n[[Category:Bluebird Records artists]]"}]}}}}
