In St. Louis, he worked with some of the early blues pioneers, including [[J.D. Short]].<ref name= barlow/>\n\nTownsend was one of the only [[musician|artists]] known to have recorded in nine consecutive decades. He first recorded in 1929 and remained active up to 2006.

He recorded on several different labels, including [[Columbia Records]] and [[Folkways Records]].<ref name=\"russell\">{{cite book\n| first= Tony\n| last= Russell\n| year= 1997\n| title= The Blues - From [[Robert Johnson (musician)|Robert Johnson]] to [[Robert Cray]]\n| edition= \n| publisher=Carlton Books Limited\n| location= Dubai\n| pages= 177\u20138\n| isbn= 1-85868-255-X}}</ref>\n[[File:03.24.2010 001.jpg|thumb|Memorial plaque for Townsend in his hometown, Shelby, Mississippi]]\nArticulate and self-aware with an excellent memory, Townsend gave many invaluable interviews to Blues enthusiasts and scholars.
