In 1916 he married and moved to Webb Jennings' Plantation near [[Drew, Mississippi]], close to the [[Dockery Plantation]].  There he met other musicians including [[Charlie Patton]] and [[Willie Brown (musician)|Willie Brown]].<ref name=trail>[http://www.nps.gov/history/delta/blues/people/tommy_johnson.htm Trail of the Hellhound: Tommy Johnson.<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n==Career==\nBy 1920 he had become an alcoholic and itinerant musician, based in Crystal Springs but traveling widely around the South, sometimes accompanied by [[Papa Charlie McCoy]].  In 1928 he made his first recordings with McCoy for [[Victor Records]].<ref name=\"AMG\"/>  The recordings included \"Canned Heat Blues\", in which he sang of drinking [[methanol]] from the cooking fuel [[Sterno]].<ref name=\"AMG\"/> The song features the refrain \"canned heat, mama, sure, Lord, killing me.\" The blues group [[Canned Heat]] took their name from this song.<ref name=\"AMG\"/>  Johnson's \"Big Road Blues\" inspired Canned Heat's song, \"[[On the Road Again (Canned Heat song)|On the Road Again]]\". A significantly different version of the song appears as \"Canned Heat\" on the ''Big Road Blues'' album by [[K. C. Douglas]].\n\nHe recorded two further sessions, in August 1928, and for [[Paramount Records]] in December 1929. He did not record again, mistakenly believing that he had signed away his right to record. This resulted in a legal settlement with The [[Mississippi Sheiks]] who had used Johnson's \"Big Road Blues\" melody in their successful \"Stop and Listen\". Johnson was party to the copyright settlement, but was too drunk at the time to understand what he had signed to.<ref>Evans, David. ''Tommy Johnson''. Studio Vista (1971), ''p''. 68. ISBN 978-0289701515</ref>\n\nJohnson's recordings established him as the premier [[Delta blues]] vocalist of his day, with a powerful voice that could go from a growl to a falsetto. He was also an accomplished guitarist. His style influenced later blues singers such as [[Robert Nighthawk]] and [[Howlin' Wolf]],<ref name=trail>as well as [[country singer]] [[Hank Williams]] [http://www.nps.gov/history/delta/blues/people/tommy_johnson.htm Trail of the Hellhound: Tommy Johnson<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> whose song \"I Asked for Water (She Brought Me Gasoline)\" was based on Johnson's \"Cool Water Blues\".<ref name=\"AMG\"/>  He was a talented composer, blending fragments of folk poetry and personalized [[lyrics]] into set guitar accompaniments to craft striking blues compositions such as \"Maggie Campbell\".<ref>Barlow, William. ''\"Looking Up At Down\": The Emergence of Blues Culture''. Temple University Press (1989), p. 42. ISBN 0-87722-583-4.</ref>\n\nTo enhance his fame, Johnson cultivated a sinister persona. According to his brother LeDell, he claimed to have [[Deal with the Devil|sold his soul]] to [[the devil]] in exchange for his mastery of the guitar.<ref name=trail>[http://www.nps.gov/history/delta/blues/people/tommy_johnson.htm Trail of the Hellhound: Tommy Johnson <!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref name = \"Evans22\">Evans, David. ''Tommy Johnson''. Studio Vista (1971), ''p''. 22. ISBN 978-0289701515</ref> This story was later also associated with [[Robert Johnson]], to whom Tommy Johnson was unrelated. Tommy Johnson also played tricks with his guitar, playing it between his legs and behind his head, and throwing it in the air while playing.<ref name=\"AMG\"/>\n\nJohnson remained a popular performer in the [[Jackson, Mississippi metropolitan area|Jackson area]] through the 1930s and 1940s, sometimes performing with [[Ishman Bracey]].<ref name=\"AMG\"/> He was highly influential on other performers, partly because he was willing to teach his style and his repertoire. Tommy Johnson's influence on local traditions is discussed by David Evans in ''Tommy Johnson'' and ''''Big Road Blues. Tradition & Creativity in the Folk Blues''.<ref>Evans, David. ''Big Road Blues. Tradition & Creativity in the Folk Blues''. Da Capo (1982). ISBN 0-306-80300-3</ref>\n\n==Death==\nHe died of a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] after playing at a party in 1956.<ref name=\"AMG\"/> He is buried in the Warm Springs Methodist Church Cemetery outside of Crystal Springs, Mississippi.<ref name=\"AMG\"/> In 2001 a headstone was commissioned through the [[Mt. Zion Memorial Fund]], a Mississippi non-profit corporation, by the family of Tommy Johnson and paid for by musician [[Bonnie Raitt]]. The large, granite memorial engraved with Johnson's portrait was not placed on Johnson's grave for several years afterward, however, due to an ongoing dispute between Tommy Johnson's family (led by his niece, Vera Johnson Collins), the owners of farm property encircling the cemetery, and the Copiah County Board of Supervisors in regard to a deteriorated road preventing access to the burial site. This issue was resolved in October 2012, when it was announced that the headstone would reach its final destination on October 26.<ref>{{Cite web | title =Miss. bluesman getting long overdue grave marker publisher =Associated Press | date =October 25, 2012 | url =http://www.knoxnews.com/news/2012/oct/25/miss-bluesman-getting-long-overdue-grave-marker/ | accessdate =October 25, 2012 }}</ref> The headstone had been on public display in the Crystal Springs, Mississippi Public Library since being unveiled on October 20, 2001.

This character describes selling his soul to the devil to play guitar. In the film, Tommy Johnson plays a number of songs originally recorded by blues musician [[Skip James]], and also accompanies the [[Soggy Bottom Boys]], a band consisting of the film's three main protagonists plus Johnson, on \"[[Man of Constant Sorrow]]\". The story of Tommy Johnson selling his soul to the devil was first told by Tommy Johnson's brother, LaDell Johnson, and reported by David Evans in his 1971 biography of Johnson.<ref name = \"Evans22\"/> This legend was subsequently transferred to the blues musician [[Robert Johnson]].<ref>Wald, Elijah, 2004, ''Escaping The Delta: Robert Johnson and the Invention of the Blues'', pp. 265\u2013276.</ref>\n\n==Discography==\n'''Victor Recordings, 1928, Memphis, TN'''\n*[http://tommyjohnson.skyrock.com/2447495141-Cool-Drink-Of-Water-Blues-1928-Memphis.html \"Cool Drink Of Water Blues\"]\n*[http://tommyjohnson.skyrock.com/2447499849-Big-Road-Blues-1928-Memphis.html \"Big Road Blues\"]\n*[http://tommyjohnson.skyrock.com/2447503201-Bye-Bye-Blues-1928-Memphis.html \"Bye-Bye Blues\"]\n*[http://tommyjohnson.skyrock.com/2447507733-Maggie-Campbell-Blues-1928-Memphis.html \"Maggie Campbell Blues\"]\n*[http://tommyjohnson.skyrock.com/2447511929-Canned-Heat-Blues-1928-Memphis.html \"Canned Heat Blues\"]\n*[http://tommyjohnson.skyrock.com/2447531611-Lonesome-Home-Blues-1928-Memphis.html \"Lonesome Home Blues (Take 1)\"]\n*[http://tommyjohnson.skyrock.com/2447531611-Lonesome-Home-Blues-1928-Memphis.html \"Lonesome Home Blues (Take 2)\"]\n*[http://tommyjohnson.skyrock.com/2447515733-Big-Fat-Mama-Blues-1928-Memphis.html \"Big Fat Mama Blues\"]\n\n'''Paramount Recordings, 1929, Grafton, WI'''\n*[http://tommyjohnson.skyrock.com/2447541631-I-Wonder-To-Myself-1929-Grafton.html \"I Wonder To Myself\"]\n*[http://tommyjohnson.skyrock.com/2447543765-Slidin-Delta-1929-Grafton.html \"Slidin' Delta\"]\n*[http://tommyjohnson.skyrock.com/2447531611-Lonesome-Home-Blues-1928-Memphis.html \"Lonesome Home Blues\"]\n*[http://tommyjohnson.skyrock.com/2447548069-Morning-Prayer-Blues-1929-Grafton.html \"Untitled Song, take 1 (Morning Prayer Blues)\"]\n*[http://tommyjohnson.skyrock.com/2447549687-Boogaloosa-Woman-1929-Grafton.html \"Untitled Song, take 2 (Boogaloosa Woman)\"]\n*[http://tommyjohnson.skyrock.com/2447545317-Black-Mare-Blues-1929-Grafton.html \"Black Mare Blues (take 1)\"]\n*[http://tommyjohnson.skyrock.com/2447545317-Black-Mare-Blues-1929-Grafton.html \"Black Mare Blues (take 2)\"]\n*[http://tommyjohnson.skyrock.com/2447553105-Ridin-Horse-1929-Grafton.html \"Ridin' Horse\"]\n*[http://tommyjohnson.skyrock.com/2447551847-Alcohol-And-Jake-Blues-1929-Grafton.html \"Alcohol And Jake Blues\"]\n*[http://tommyjohnson.skyrock.com/2447540079-I-Want-Someone-To-Love-Me-1929-Grafton.html \"I Want Someone To Love Me\"]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.tommyjohnsonblues.com/index.html  Tommy Johnson Blues Foundation site]\n* [http://www.wirz.de/music/johnsont.htm Illustrated Tommy Johnson discography]\n*[http://www.tom-graves.com/id12.html Site for \"Crossroads:  The Life and Afterlife of Blues Legend Robert Johnson\"] with links and material related to Tommy Johnson\n* [http://www.harptab.com/lyrics/ly5159.shtml  Canned Heat Blues Lyrics]\n* [https://archive.org/details/Cannedheat MP3 Audio file of \"Canned Heat Blues\" on The Internet Archive]\n* [http://www.paramountshome.org/modules.php?op=modload&name=PagEd&file=index&topic_id=&page_id=81 Tommy Johnson on Paramount Records]{{Dead link|date=April 2009}}\n* {{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p398|label=Tommy Johnson}}\n*{{Worldcat id|lccn-n84-11691}}\n\n{{Authority control|VIAF=27257077}}\n\n{{Persondata <!-- Metadata: see [[Wikipedia:Persondata]]. -->\n| NAME              =Johnson, Tommy\n| ALTERNATIVE NAMES =\n| SHORT DESCRIPTION = [[United States|American]] [[delta blues]] musician\n| DATE OF BIRTH     = 1896\n| PLACE OF BIRTH    = [[Terry, Mississippi]], [[United States]]\n| DATE OF DEATH     = November 1, 1956\n| PLACE OF DEATH    = [[Crystal Springs, Mississippi]], United States\n}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Johnson, Tommy}}\n[[Category:1896 births]]\n[[Category:1956 deaths]]\n[[Category:People from Hinds County, Mississippi]]\n[[Category:African-American musicians]]\n[[Category:Delta blues musicians]]\n[[Category:Country blues musicians]]\n[[Category:American blues guitarists]]\n[[Category:Country blues singers]]\n[[Category:Blues Hall of Fame inductees]]\n[[Category:American blues musicians]]\n[[Category:Blues musicians from Mississippi]]\n[[Category:Deaths from myocardial infarction]]\n[[Category:Paramount Records artists]]\n\n{{Link GA|fr}}"}]}}}}
