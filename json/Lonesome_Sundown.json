He returned to Donaldsonville by 1948 and, inspired by [[Muddy Waters]] and [[John Lee Hooker]], began taking guitar lessons from a cousin.  In 1953, after a brief period as a truck driver in [[Jeanerette, Louisiana]], he moved again to work at the Gulf Oil Refinery in [[Port Arthur, Texas]].  By this time he had begun to take his music more seriously, jamming at local clubs, and in 1955 was invited by [[Clifton Chenier]] to sit in with his new band, the Zydeco Ramblers, at the Blue Moon Club in [[Lake Charles, Louisiana|Lake Charles]]. Chenier offered him the post of second guitarist in the band, alongside first guitarist [[Phillip Walker]]. Green toured with them as far as [[Chicago]] and [[Los Angeles]], where Chenier's recording of \"The Cat's Dreaming\" was inspired by Green falling asleep during a session, and where Green auditioned for producer [[Bumps Blackwell]] but failed to get a contract.<ref name=\"broven\"/><ref name=\"AMG\">{{cite web|author=Bill Dahl |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/lonesome-sundown-mn0000830718/biography |title=Lonesome Sundown &#124; Biography |publisher=AllMusic |date= |accessdate=2014-01-27}}</ref><ref name=\"Offbeat\">{{cite web |first= |last= |url=http://www.offbeat.com/2003/09/01/cornelius-green-lonesome-sundown/|title=Masters of Louisiana Music: Cornelius Green \"Lonesome Sundown\" by Jeff Hannusch |publisher=Offbeat.com |accessdate=November 23, 2009}}</ref><ref name=\"russell\">{{cite book\n| first= Tony\n| last= Russell\n| year= 1997\n| title= The Blues: From Robert Johnson to Robert Cray\n| edition= \n| publisher= Carlton Books Limited \n| location= Dubai\n| page= 138\n| isbn= 1-85868-255-X}}</ref>\n\nGreen married later in 1955, left the Zydeco Ramblers, and moved to [[Opelousas, Louisiana]] where he began playing with Lloyd Reynauld and writing his own material.  He recorded a [[demo (music)|demo]] tape, and took it to producer [[J. D. \"Jay\" Miller]] in [[Crowley, Louisiana|Crowley]].  Miller was impressed, gave the singer/ guitarist the [[stage name]] \"Lonesome Sundown\", and recorded his debut [[single (music)|single]], \"Leave My Money Alone\" b/w \"Lost Without Love\", which he leased to Excello Records in 1956.  The follow-up, \"Lonesome Whistler\" b/w \"My Home Is A Prison\", was more successful, and Sundown became one of Miller's south Louisiana stable of musicians. Although he never had a [[record chart|chart]] [[hit record|hit]], he recorded for Miller for eight years, and his records sold in respectable quantities, his output including \"Don\u2019t Say A Word\" (featuring [[Lazy Lester]] on [[harmonica]]), \"I'm a Mojo Man,\" \"You Know I Love You,\"  \"I Stood By (And Watched Another Man Steal My Gal),\" \"My Home Ain't Here,\" and the much [[cover version|covered]], \"Gonna Stick To You Baby.\"<ref name=\"broven\"/><ref name=\"AMG\"/><ref name=\"Offbeat\"/><ref name=\"russell\"/> Unusually for Louisiana musicians, Sundown's style of the [[blues]] was more in keeping with the sound of Muddy Waters than that of [[Jimmy Reed]],<ref name=\"AMG\"/> and his sombre and melancholic recordings and instantly recognizable style were described by Miller as \"the sound of the swamp\".<ref name=\"Offbeat\"/>\n\nSundown continued to work with Miller into the early 1960s, and in 1964 recorded \"Hoo Doo Woman Blues\" b/w \"I\u2019ve Got A Broken Heart\", recordings which have been described as among \"the last ethnic down-home blues [[45 (record)|45]]s aimed exclusively at the Negro market\".<ref name=\"broven\"/> However, by 1965 Sundown had become disillusioned with his lack of success, experienced a traumatic divorce, retired from the [[music industry]] to work as a laborer, and joined the Lord Jesus Christ of the Apostolic Faith Fellowship Throughout the World Church, where he eventually became a minister.<ref name=\"AMG\"/><ref name=\"russell\"/> He was persuaded back to the [[recording studio]]s in 1977, and recorded another blues [[album]], ''Been Gone Too Long'', co-produced by [[Bruce Bromberg]] and Dennis Walker, originally for Joliet Records.<ref name=\"AMG\"/> Despite its quality, disappointing sales ensued, even after being reissued on [[Alligator Records|Alligator]].<ref name=\"AMG\"/> His final single release was 1977's \"I Betcha\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://koti.mbnet.fi/wdd/lonesomesundown.htm |title=WangDangDula.com |publisher=Koti.mbnet.fi |date=2010-12-24 |accessdate=2014-01-27}}</ref>\n\nSundown did several [[concert]]s, including an appearance at the 1979 [[New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival]], and tours of [[Sweden]] and [[Japan]] with Phillip Walker, but then walked away from the music business for good.<ref name=\"Offbeat\"/><ref name=\"russell\"/>  In 1994 he suffered a [[stroke]], and he was no longer able to speak.
