Musselwhite was reportedly the inspiration for [[Dan Aykroyd]]'s character in the [[Blues Brothers]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Dees |first=Leslie N. |url=http://www.starherald.net/breakingnews/local_story_022170328.html |title=Kosciusko to be featured on Blues Trail \u00bb Local News \u00bb starherald.net - Kosciusko, MS |publisher=starherald.net |accessdate=2011-12-30}}</ref>\n\n==Biography==\n===Childhood===\nMusselwhite was born in [[Kosciusko, Mississippi]], [[United States]]. He has said that he is of [[Choctaw]] descent, and he was born in a region originally inhabited by the Choctaw. However, in a 2005 interview, he said his mother had told him he was actually [[Cherokee]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://harmonica-musician.com/charlie_musselwhite.htm |title=Charlie Musselwhite |publisher=Harmonica-musician.com |date=1944-01-31 |accessdate=2011-12-30}}</ref>\n\nHis family considered it normal to play music, with his father playing guitar and harmonica, his mother playing piano, and a relative who was a one-man band.  At the age of three, Musselwhite moved to [[Memphis, Tennessee]]. When he was a teenager, Memphis experienced the period when [[rockabilly]], [[western swing]], and [[electric blues]] and other forms of [[African American music]] were combining to give birth to [[rock and roll]].  The period featured [[Elvis Presley]], [[Jerry Lee Lewis]], and [[Johnny Cash]], as well as lesser known musicians such as [[Gus Cannon]], [[Furry Lewis]], [[Will Shade]], and [[Johnny Burnette]].  Musselwhite supported himself by digging ditches, laying concrete and running moonshine in a 1950 Lincoln automobile. This environment was Musselwhite's school for music as well as life, and he acquired the nickname \"Memphis Charlie.\"{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}\n\n===Career===\nIn true bluesman fashion, Musselwhite then took off in search of the rumored \"big-paying factory jobs\" up the \"Hillbilly Highway\", the [[U.S. Route 51|Highway 51]] to Chicago, where he continued his education on the [[South Side, Chicago|South Side]], making the acquaintance of even more legends including [[Lew Soloff]], [[Muddy Waters]], [[Junior Wells]], [[Sonny Boy Williamson II|Sonny Boy Williamson]], [[Buddy Guy]], [[Howlin' Wolf]], [[Little Walter]], and [[Big Walter Horton]]. Musselwhite immersed himself completely in the musical life, living in the basement of, and occasionally working at Jazz Record Mart (the record store operated by [[Delmark Records]] founder [[Bob Koester]]) with [[Big Joe Williams]] and working as a driver for an exterminator, which allowed him to observe what was happening around the city's clubs and bars. He spent his time hanging out at the Jazz Record Mart at the corner of State and Grand and the nearby bar, Mr. Joe's, with the city's blues musicians, and sitting in with Big Joe Williams and others in the clubs, playing for tips.  There he forged a lifelong friendship with [[John Lee Hooker]]; though Hooker lived in Detroit, Michigan, the two often visited each other, and Hooker served as best man at Musselwhite's third marriage.  Gradually Musselwhite became well known around town.\n\nIn time, Musselwhite led his own blues band, and, after [[Elektra Records]]' success with [[Paul Butterfield]],  he released the legendary ''[[Stand Back! Here Comes Charley Musselwhite's Southside Band]]'' album in 1966 on [[Vanguard Records]] (as \"Charley Musselwhite\"), to immediate and great success.<ref name=legends>{{cite book | title = Legends of Rock Guitar: The Essential Reference of Rock's Greatest Guitarists | first = Pete | last = Prown |author2=Harvey P.

Here Comes Charlie Musselwhite's Southside Blues Band'' was a thrilling album and successfully ushered him into the blues fold.}}</ref> He took advantage of the clout this album gave him to move to San Francisco, where, instead of being one of many competing blues acts, he held court as the king of the blues in the exploding countercultural music scene, an exotic and gritty figure to the flower children. Musselwhite even convinced Hooker to move out to California.\n\nSince then, Musselwhite has released over 20 albums, as well as guesting on albums by many other musicians, such as [[Bonnie Raitt]]'s ''[[Longing in Their Hearts]]'' and  [[The Blind Boys of Alabama]]'s ''[[Spirit of the Century]]'', both winners of Grammy awards.  He also appeared on   [[Tom Waits]]' ''[[Mule Variations]]'' and [[INXS]]' ''[[Suicide Blonde]]''. He himself has won 14 [[W. C. Handy Award]]s and six Grammy nominations, as well as Lifetime Achievement Awards from the [[Monterey Blues Festival]] and the [[San Javier Jazz Festival]] in San Javier, Spain, and the Mississippi [[Governor's Award for Excellence in the Arts]].\n\nIn 1979, Musselwhite recorded ''The Harmonica According to Charlie Musselwhite'' in London for [[Kicking Mule Records]], intended to go with an instructional book; the album itself became so popular that it has been released on CD. In June 2008, Blind Pig Records reissued the album on 180-gram vinyl with new cover art.<ref>{{cite web|author=Blind Pig Records |url=http://blindpigrecords.com/index.cfm?section=album&catalognum=BPLP5016 |title=Blind Pig Catalog |publisher=Blindpigrecords.com |date=2008-06-24 |accessdate=2013-07-17}}</ref> [[File:Liri Blues Charlie Musselwhite 2000.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Charlie Musselwhite at the [[Liri Blues Festival]], Italy, in 2000.]]\n\nIn 1990 Musselwhite signed with [[Alligator Records]], a step that led to a resurgence of his career.\n\nIn 1998, Musselwhite appeared in the film ''[[Blues Brothers 2000]]''. He provided the harmonica position in the super-ensemble [[The Louisiana Gator Boys]], which also featured many other rhythm and blues legends such as [[B.B. King]], [[Bo Diddley]], [[Eric Clapton]], [[Koko Taylor]], [[Jimmie Vaughan]], [[Dr. John]], and [[Jack DeJohnette]].\n\nOver the years, Musselwhite has branched out in style. His 1999 recording, ''Continental Drifter'', is accompanied by  [[Cuarteto Patria]], from Cuba's Santiago region, the Cuban music analog of the [[Mississippi Delta]]. Because of the political differences between Cuba and the United States, the album was recorded in Bergen, Norway, with Musselwhite's wife ironing out all the details.\n\nMusselwhite believes the key to his musical success was finding a style where he could express himself. He has said,  \"I only know one tune, and I play it faster or slower, or I change the key, but it\u2019s just the one tune I\u2019ve ever played in my life. It\u2019s all I know.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bluesinlondon.com/feat_musselwhite.html |title=Interview with Charlie Musselwhite |publisher=Bluesinlondon.com |accessdate=2013-07-17}}</ref>\n\nHis past two albums, ''[[Sanctuary (Charlie Musselwhite album)|Sanctuary]]'' and ''[[Delta Hardware]]'' have both been released on [[Real World Records]].\n\nMusselwhite plays on [[Tom Waits]]' 1999 album ''[[Mule Variations]]''. He can be heard at the beginning of the song \"Chocolate Jesus\" saying \"I love it\". Waits has mentioned that he feels this is his favorite part of the song.<ref name=\"ILoveIt\">{{cite web | year = 2006 | url = http://www.keeslau.com/TomWaitsSupplement/Lyrics/Mulevariations/Chocolatejesus-ub.htm  | title = LYRICS: Mule Variations: Chocolate Jesus | publisher = Tom Waits Supplement | author = Hartmans, P. | accessdate = June 17, 2006 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20061104095531/http://www.keeslau.com/TomWaitsSupplement/Lyrics/Mulevariations/Chocolatejesus-ub.htm |archivedate = November 4, 2006}}</ref>\n\nIn 2002, he featured on the [[Bo Diddley]] tribute album ''Hey Bo Diddley - A Tribute!'', performing the song \"[[Hey Bo Diddley]]\".\n\nMusselwhite lost both of his elderly parents in December 2005, in separate incidents.
