His formative musical years were spent listening to rock, blues, funk, and soul, while his interest in jazz developed later on, thanks to the music of [[John Coltrane]], [[Miles Davis]], and others. He still professes to being a blues player at heart.\n\nAfter graduating from [[Florida Atlantic University]], Henderson moved to Los Angeles and began his career in earnest, playing rock with Twilight, a four-piece cover band that included [[Alice Long]] on bass and vocals.  Soon, Henderson was recording with violinist [[Jean-Luc Ponty]], bassist [[Jeff Berlin]] and \"Players\", and [[Weather Report]]'s [[Joe Zawinul]]. Henderson first began receiving serious attention as the original guitarist for the [[Chick Corea Elektric Band]]. But he stayed only six months with Corea and left after a disagreement.\n\n==Tribal Tech==\n\nHenderson formed [[Tribal Tech]] with bass player [[Gary Willis]] in 1984. Under the direction of Henderson and Willis, Tribal Tech became one of the most highly regarded fusion bands of the 1980s.  He toured and recorded with the band up until their dissolution following the 2000 album ''Rocket Science'', and during that time brought himself to the forefront of modern jazz/fusion guitar playing. In 1991 he was named '#1 Jazz Guitarist' by Guitar World magazine, and in January 1992 he was voted best jazz guitarist in Guitar Player magazine's Annual Reader's Poll.\n\n==Recent recordings==\n\nHenderson has more recently moved back to his blues roots, releasing the blues album ''Dog Party'' in 1994, and ''Tore Down House'' (1997). He recorded ''Well To The Bone'' (2003) with bass player, [[John Humphrey (bass player)|John Humphrey]], and Kirk Covington on drums. His latest solo release ''Scott Henderson Live'' (2005) follows in this vein, and his work has also moved into funk/jazz fusion. He has repeatedly stated that he is enjoying playing in bands which do not have keyboard players, as it allows him to branch out more and properly explore the guitar's full potential as an instrument.\n\nHenderson is also a member of the fusion supergroup [[Vital Tech Tones]] with [[Victor Wooten]] and [[Steve Smith (musician)|Steve Smith]], which has released two CDs as of 2006.\n\nHenderson has appeared as a guest artist on a number of recordings including [[Scott Kinsey]]'s 2006 CD ''[[Kinesthetics (Scott Kinsey album)|Kinesthetics]]'', Amber Whitlock's ''The Colours Of Life'', and Rob Whitlock's ''Sketchin''' and ''Sketchin' 2''.\n\nTribal Tech released its first album in over a decade with 2011's 'X'.\n\nHenderson released the fusion trio album ''HBC'' in October 2012 with bassist Jeff Berlin and drummer Dennis Chambers.\n\nHenderson teaches at the [[Guitar Institute of Technology]], which is part of the [[Musicians Institute]] in Hollywood, California.  He has released two instructional guitar videos.\n\n==Discography==\n\nWith [[Tribal Tech]]:\n*''[[Spears (Tribal Tech album)|Spears]]'' (1985)\n*''[[Dr. Hee]]'' (1987)\n*''[[Nomad (Tribal Tech album)|Nomad]]'' (1990)\n*''[[Tribal Tech (album)|Tribal Tech]]'' (1991)\n*''[[Illicit (Tribal Tech album)|Illicit]]'' (1992)\n*''[[Face First]]'' (1993)\n*''Reality Check'' (1995)\n*''[[Thick (album)|Thick]]'' (1999)\n*''[[Rocket Science (Tribal Tech album)|Rocket Science]]'' (2000)\n*''X'' (2011)\n\nWith [[Vital Tech Tones]] (Henderson, [[Victor Wooten]] and [[Steve Smith (musician)|Steve Smith]]):\n*''Vital Tech Tones'' (1998)\n*''VTT2'' (2000)\n\nSolo:\n*''[[Dog Party]]'' (1994)\n*''[[Tore Down House]]'' (1997)\n*''[[Well to the Bone]]'' (2002)\n*''[[Live!
