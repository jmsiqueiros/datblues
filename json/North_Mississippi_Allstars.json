The band is composed of brothers [[Luther Dickinson]] (guitar, vocals) and  Cody Dickinson (drums, keyboards, electric washboard), and Chris Chew ([[bass guitar|electric bass guitar]]).  In addition to the guitar, Dickinson also plays a [[cigar box guitar]] called the \"lowebow.\"\n\nA \"lowebow\" is a variation of the cigar box guitar, created by John Lowe in the 1990s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cigarboxguitars.com/tag/lowebow |title=lowebow |publisher=Cigar Box Guitars |date= |accessdate=2013-10-20}}</ref>  It involves one cigar box, with two wooden rods projecting from it.  Each wooden rod holds one string each: a bass string and a standard acoustic guitar string.  This allows the player to pluck a one-string bass and a one-string guitar at the same time.  Each of the two strings has its own individual electric pick-up that feeds into the amplifier.  This guitar was created with the [[One-man band]] performer in mind.<ref>{{cite web|last=Bridgman |first=Gary |url=http://www.memphisflyer.com/memphis/commentary-how-lowebow-can-you-go/Content?oid=1123008 |title=COMMENTARY: How Lowebow Can You Go? &#124; News Feature &#124; Memphis News and Events |publisher=Memphis Flyer |date= |accessdate=2013-10-20}}</ref>\n\nDuwayne Burnside, who formerly played second guitar in the band, is a son of [[R. L. Burnside]] (who also played on some of the band's tracks).\n\nAllstars' first release, ''Shake Hands With Shorty'', was nominated for a [[Grammy Award]] for \"Best Contemporary Blues Album\". Since then, ''51 Phantom'' and ''Electric Blue Watermelon'' have received nominations in that same category.  The group also won a [[Blues Music Award]] for \"Best New Artist Debut\" in 2001.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blues.org/bluesmusicawards/pastyears.php4?YearId=5 |title=The Blues Foundation : Homepage : Past Blues Music Awards (2001) publisher=Blues.org |accessdate=2013-10-20}}</ref>\n\nThe band made their network television debut in 2000 on ''[[Late Night with Conan O'Brien]]''. They also served as the house band for a short period in 2004 on ''[[Last Call with Carson Daly]]''.\n\nThe band now backs up and tours with [[John Hiatt]].  They have released an [[album]] with him entitled ''[[Master of Disaster]]''. All the members of the Allstars have also teamed up with [[Robert Randolph]] and [[John Medeski]] to form [[The Word (band)|The Word]].\n\nIn November 2007, Luther Dickinson joined [[The Black Crowes]] as lead guitarist, and has appeared on their albums ''[[Warpaint (The Black Crowes album)|Warpaint]]'' (2008), ''[[Before the Frost...Until the Freeze]]'' (2009) and ''[[Croweology]]'' (2010). Luther Dickinson currently devotes his time to both the Black Crowes and the North Mississippi Allstars. Cody Dickinson has also started a side project, Hill Country Revue, featuring Daniel Coburn, Kirk Smithhart, Doc Samba and Ed Cleveland.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hillcountryrevue.com/about.php |title=Official Website |publisher=Hill Country Revue |date= |accessdate=2011-12-31}}</ref> They are sometimes joined by Luther Dickinson and members of the Burnside family. They have released two albums, ''Make A Move'' (2009) and ''Zebra Ranch'' (2010).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hillcountryrevue.com |title=Official Website |publisher=Hill Country Revue |date= |accessdate=2011-12-31}}</ref>\n\nLuther and Cody Dickinson's father was the Memphis musician and record producer, [[Jim Dickinson]]. He, besides releasing music in his own name, worked with [[Ry Cooder]], [[Bob Dylan]], [[the Rolling Stones]], and [[Primal Scream]]. Jim Dickinson also set up the Zebra Ranch [[recording studio]] complex during the 1990s in Hernando, Mississippi. His career spanned more than four decades before he died on August 15, 2009.\n\nThe band opened for [[Robert Plant]] and the [[Band of Joy]] on their concert tour in 2011. They also opened for [[Dave Matthews Band]] in the spring of 2013.\n\nTheir latest release, ''World Boogie Is Coming'' was issued on September 3, 2013.<ref>{{cite web|author=Steve Leggett |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/world-boogie-is-coming-mw0002562495 |title=World Boogie Is Coming - North Mississippi Allstars &#124; Songs, Reviews, Credits, Awards |publisher=AllMusic |date=2013-09-03 |accessdate=2013-10-20}}</ref>\n\n==Releases==\n*''Shake Hands With Shorty'' (2000)\n*''51 Phantom'' (2001)\n*''Polaris'' (2003)\n*''Tate County (Hill Country Blues)'' (2003) Private Release\n*''Hill Country Revue: Live at [[Bonnaroo]]'' (2004)\n*''Instores & Outtakes [EP]'' (2004)\n*''Electric Blue Watermelon'' (2005)\n*''Screwed & Chopped [EP]'' (2005)\n*''Keep On Marchin' - Live In Burlington, VT (2007)\n*''Mississippi Folk Music - Volume One (2007)\n*''[[Hernando (album)|Hernando]]'' (2008)\n*''Boulderado - Live At The Fox (2008)\n*''Do It Like We Used to Do'' (2009, 2CD+DVD live set)\n*''Live In The Hills - Bootleg'' (2010)\n*''Keys To The Kingdom'' (2011)\n*''World Boogie Is Coming'' (September 3, 2013)<ref>{{cite web|author=Steve Leggett |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/world-boogie-is-coming-mw0002562495 |title=World Boogie Is Coming - North Mississippi Allstars &#124; Songs, Reviews, Credits, Awards |publisher=AllMusic |date=2013-09-03 |accessdate=2013-10-20}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{official website|http://www.nmallstars.com/}}\n* {{myspace|nmallstars}}\n* {{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p429302|label=North Mississippi Allstars}}\n* [http://www.zebraranch.com/ Jim Dickinson's Web Site and the private release of ''Tate County(Hill Country Blues)'']\n* [http://www.jambands.com/CDReviews/content_2003_12_29.12.phtml/ Review of ''Tate County(Hill Country Blues)''] at Jambands.com\n* [http://www.hillcountryrevue.com/index.php Hill Country Revue Official Website]\n* [http://www.archive.org/details/NorthMississippiAllstars North Mississippi Allstars collection] at the [[Internet Archive]]'s live music archive\n\n[[Category:Musical groups from Mississippi]]\n[[Category:Musical groups established in 1996]]\n[[Category:Southern rock musical groups]]\n[[Category:American blues musical groups]]\n[[Category:Blues rock groups]]\n[[Category:Blues musicians from Mississippi]]"}]}}}}
