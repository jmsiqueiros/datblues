He spent much of his early years playing [[rockabilly]] piano in the late 1950s, playing [[electric organ|organ]] in [[rock and roll]] [[band (music)|bands]] in the 1960s and playing piano in numerous [[country music]] bands in the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s. A Mid-South Fair Winner in 1966, Sowell was inducted into the [[Rockabilly Hall of Fame]] in 2002. In 1994, he went out as a solo artist. As a pianist and composer, Sowell has recorded 8 [[album]]s, crossing many genres of music, from [[jazz]], [[Pop music|pop]], [[rock and roll]], [[honky tonk]] and [[blues]] to [[country music]], [[gospel music|gospel]] and [[easy listening]].\n\nThe following Memphis [[musicians]] were all part of bands with Sowell during the 1960s, 1970s, 1980s or 1990s:\nBarry Sowell ([[Amazing Rhythm Aces]]),\n[[Bobby Whitlock]] ([[Eric Clapton]]/[[George Harrison]]),\nBill Humble ([[Elvis Presley]]/[[Tom Jones (singer)|Tom Jones]]),\nDanny Fitzgerald ([[Johnny Rodriguez]]),\nDavid Miller ([[Bill Black]]/[[U2]]),\nEddie Slusser ([[Jerry Lee Lewis]]/[[Hank Williams Jr]]),\nFred Prouty ([[Charlie Rich]]),\nGlenn Childress ([[Lonestar]]),\nJack Holder ([[Black Oak Arkansas]]),\nJim Gammell ([[Eddie Bond]]),\nRobert Johnson ([[The Rolling Stones]]/[[ZZ Top]]),\nRonnie Scaife ([[Neil Diamond]]), and [[Roy Yeager]] ([[Crackerjacks]]/[[Lobo (musician)|Lobo]]/[[Atlanta Rhythm Section]]/[[Ronnie Milsap]]).\n[[Image:Bobby97.JPG||thumb|right|Performing 1997]]\n\n==Biography==\n[[Image:Bobby1959.jpg|thumb|right|Performing 1959]]\nHis birth name is Robert G. Lee Sowell. He was named after a famous [[Southern Baptist]] [[preacher]], Dr Robert G. Lee.\nWhen Sowell got drafted during the [[Vietnam War]], he dropped the G and became Robert Lee Sowell. In [[music]], his [[stage name]] has always been Bobby or Bobby Lee. Growing up in Memphis, Sowell had a lot of diversified musical influences. Early influences included [[Hank Williams]], [[Elvis Presley]], [[Carl Perkins]] and [[Muddy Waters]]. But what really got his attention were the [[piano]] players of that day, [[Jerry Lee Lewis]], [[Fats Domino]], [[Ray Charles]], [[Roger Williams (pianist)|Roger Williams]] and [[Floyd Cramer]]. Sowell met [[Floyd Cramer]] when he was 16 years old and that experience really had a lasting effect on his music. On the family side, his Father played [[harmonica]] and [[piano]] by ear and his Mother sang, played the [[guitar]] and sung on the [[radio]] in [[Chattanooga, Tennessee]] in the 1940s. They used to have regular family sing-a-longs, inviting area musicians to join in. Those early rock and roll years, along with being subjected to the sounds of [[rockabilly]], honkytonk, blues, gospel and his Mother's country music had an influence on Sowell's music creativity and can be heard in his music style throughout his career.\n\n==Early life==\nAbout the time Sowell was 12 years old, honkytonk and rockabilly music was really thriving in Memphis and he started playing in bars and [[nightclubs]] with much older musicians. They used to sneak him in the back door and hide him behind an upright piano where no one could see how young he was. Sowell also played a lot of Sock Hops and actually joined his first band in 1959, called 'The Red Notes'.  They were an all [[instrumental]] group. His parents' house hosted many [[jam sessions]] for area musicians. Many successful professional musicians have come out of Frayser [[suburb]] of Memphis and Sowell has picked with most of them.\n[[Image:BobbyLV72.jpg|thumb|right|Las Vegas 1972]]\nAround the age of 16 the [[British Invasion]] meant Sowell had to adapt to a new kind of music, in which the [[organ (music)|organ]] was a more prominent instrument than the piano. Sowell played in numerous groups in the 60s. In 1966 Sowell won the [[Mid-South Fair]] and was scheduled to appear on the [[Ted Mack]] Original Amateur Hour on [[CBS]] [[Television]], but before he could go there, he got drafted during the [[Vietnam War]] and his musical career was put on hold. After the war and a bout with [[alcoholism]], Sowell got back on the right track. He returned to his first love, the piano, playing and recording in an easy listening style format.\n\n==Later life==\nSowell spent six decades performing music professionally from 1959 to the present day. In 2010, he formed a new blues band 'Coldwater Revival' and actively is performing and recording new music. He helps other new and upcoming artists through association with New Deal Music, a Memphis based artist and development company, specializing in new raw talent.\n\nAs a born again [[Christian]] and [[Vietnam]] veteran, Sowell also plays organ at his local church and is active in veteran's organizations, supporting U.S. troops in [[Iraq]] and [[Afghanistan]].\n\n[[Image:BobbyTV73.jpg|thumb|right|Performing TV 1973]]\n[[Image:BobbySowellshowpic.JPG|thumb|right|Performing 1982]]\n[[Image:BobbySowellMem96.jpg|thumb|right|Performing 1997]]\n[[Image:BobbySowellChritmas96.jpg||thumb|right|Performing 1998]]\n[[Image:Bobby07.JPG||thumb|right|Performing 2007]]\n\n==Discography==\n*''Natural High'' (1996)\n*''Country Gold Tribute'' (1999)\n*''Rags To Witches'' (2001)\n*''Hymns Of Praise'' (2003)\n*''Christmas Classics'' (2005)\n*''Piano Moods'' (2005)\n*''Raining Down Blues'' (2006)\n*''Rocking Bobby Lee'' (2006)\n*''Country Routes'' (2007)\n*''Blues and Greens'' (2007)\n*''Jam Sessions'' (2011)\n\n==Selected reading==\n* ''Bobby Sowell Rockabilly Biography:'' Bob Timmers (2002)\n* ''History of Memphis Bands: 1960&ndash;1975''  Ron Hall (2003)\n* ''Memphis Blues Musicians: Amazon.com'' (2010)\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n1.http://www.rockabillyhall.com/BobbySowell1.html  \"Rockabilly Hall of Fame\"<br>\n2.http://www.rockabillyhall.com/Certificates.html \"Induction Certificate\"\n\n{{Persondata <!-- Metadata: see [[Wikipedia:Persondata]]. -->\n| NAME              =Sowell, Bobby\n| ALTERNATIVE NAMES =\n| SHORT DESCRIPTION = American musician\n| DATE OF BIRTH     =July 8, 1947\n| PLACE OF BIRTH    =[[Memphis, Tennessee]]\n| DATE OF DEATH     =\n| PLACE OF DEATH    =\n}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Sowell, Bobby}}\n[[Category:1947 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:American country pianists]]\n[[Category:Memphis blues musicians]]\n[[Category:American rockabilly musicians]]\n[[Category:American blues musicians]]\n[[Category:People from Memphis, Tennessee]]"}]}}}}
