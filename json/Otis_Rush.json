His distinctive [[guitar]] style features a slow burning sound and long bent notes. With similar qualities to [[Magic Sam]] and [[Buddy Guy]], his sound became known as West Side Chicago blues and was an influence on many musicians including [[Mike Bloomfield|Michael Bloomfield]] and [[Eric Clapton]].\n\nRush is left-handed and, unlike many other left-handed guitarists, plays a left-handed instrument strung upside-down with the low E string at the bottom. He played often with the little finger of his pick hand curled under the low E for positioning. It is widely believed that this contributes to his distinctive sound. He has a wide-ranging, powerful tenor voice.\n\n== Career ==\nAfter moving to [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]] in 1948,<ref name=singles>Joel Whitburn's Top R&B Singles 1942-1988 (Record Research)</ref> Rush made a name for himself playing in clubs on both the South Side and West Side blues scenes. From 1956 to 1958, he recorded for the [[Cobra Records]] and released eight singles, some featuring [[Ike Turner]] or [[Jody Williams]] on guitar. His first single \"[[I Can't Quit You Baby]]\" in 1956 reached No. 6 on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'''s R&B chart.<ref name=singles /> During his tenure with Cobra, he recorded some of his well known songs such as \"[[Double Trouble (Otis Rush song)|Double Trouble]]\" and \"[[All Your Love (I Miss Loving)]].\"<ref name=\"russell\">{{cite book\n| first= Tony\n| last= Russell\n| year= 1997\n| title= The Blues - From [[Robert Johnson (musician)|Robert Johnson]] to [[Robert Cray]]\n| edition= \n| publisher=Carlton Books Limited \n| location= Dubai\n| pages= 164\n| isbn= 1-85868-255-X}}</ref>\n\nAfter Cobra Records went bankrupt in 1959, Rush landed a recording contract with [[Chess Records|Chess]] in 1960. He recorded eight tracks for the label, four of which were released on two singles that year. Six tracks including the two singles later came out on \"Door To Door\" album in 1969, a compilation also featuring Chess recordings by [[Albert King]]. \n\nHe also went into the studio for [[Duke Records]] in 1962, but only one single \"Homework/I Have to Laugh\" was issued from the label.<ref>[http://members.jcom.home.ne.jp/bluesy/rush/duke.html Otis Rush Disk Guide]</ref>  It also received a release in Great Britain on Vocalion VP9260 in 1963. In 1965, he recorded for [[Vanguard Records|Vanguard]] which can be heard on the label's compilation album, ''Chicago/The Blues/Today! Vol.2''.\n\nIn the 1960s, Rush began playing in other cities in the U.S. and also to [[Europe]], most notably [[American Folk Blues Festival|the American Folk Blues Festival]]. \n\nIn 1969, the album ''Mourning in the Morning'' was released on [[Cotillion Records]]. Recorded at the [[FAME Studios]] in [[Muscle Shoals, Alabama]], the album was produced by Michael Bloomfield and [[Nick Gravenites]] (then of [[Electric Flag]]). The sound that incorporated soul and rock was a brand new direction for Rush. \n\nIn 1971, Rush recorded the album ''[[Right Place, Wrong Time (album)|Right Place, Wrong Time]]'' in [[San Francisco, California]] for [[Capitol Records]], but Capitol decided not to release it. The album was finally released in 1976 when Rush purchased the master from Capitol and had it released by [[P-Vine Records]] in [[Japan]]. Bullfrog Records released it in the U.S. soon after. The album generally has since gained a reputation as one of the best works by Rush.<ref>[{{Allmusic|class=album|id=r89467|pure_url=yes}} ''Right Place, Wrong Time'' review on Allmusic]</ref><ref>[http://www.amazon.com/Right-Place-Wrong-Time-Otis/dp/B0000005O7 Customer reviews on amazon.com]</ref>\n\nIn the 1970s, he also released some albums on [[Delmark Records]] and also from [[Sonet Records]] in Europe, but by the end of the decade he stopped performing and recording.\n[[File:Orush.jpg|thumb|230px|right|Otis Rush performing in 2002]]\n\nRush made a come back in 1985 making a U.S. tour and releasing the live album, ''Tops'', recorded at the  [[San Francisco Blues Festival]]. \n\nIn 1994, Rush released ''Ain't Enough Comin' In'', the first studio album in 16 years.<ref name=\"russell\"/> ''Any Place I'm Goin''' followed in 1998, and Rush earned his first [[Grammy Award for Best Traditional Blues Album]] in 1999.\n\nThough he has not recorded a new studio album since 1998, he continued to tour and perform. In 2002, he was featured on the [[Bo Diddley]] tribute album ''Hey Bo Diddley - A Tribute!'', performing the song \"[[I'm A Man (Bo Diddley song)|I'm A Man]]\" produced by Carla Olson.\n\nHowever, he suffered a stroke in 2004 which has kept him from performing since. In 2006, Rush released his latest CD, ''Live and From San Francisco'' on Blues Express Records, a live recording from 1999. Video footage of the same show was released on the DVD ''Live Part 1'' in 2003.\n\nRush has two daughters and two sons from a previous marriage and 2 daughters from his second marriage, Lena and Sophia.\n\n== Discography ==\n===Original albums===\n*1969 ''[[Mourning in the Morning]]'' (Cotillion)\n*1974 ''Screamin' and Cryin''' (Black And Blue)\n*1975 ''Cold Day in Hell'' (Delmark)\n*1976 ''So Many Roads'' (Delmark)\n*1976 ''[[Right Place, Wrong Time (album)|Right Place, Wrong Time]]'' (Bullfrog)\n*1978 ''Troubles Troubles'' (Sonet)\n*1988 ''Tops'' (Blind Pig)\n*1989 ''[[Blues Interaction \u2013 Live in Japan 1986]]-'' (P-Vine)\n*1991 ''Lost in the Blues'' (Alligator Records ALCD4797)\n*1993 ''Live in Europe'' (Evidence Music ECD 26034-2)\n*1994 ''Ain't Enough Comin' In'' (This Way Up)\n*1998 ''Any Place I'm Going'' (House Of Blues)\n*2006 ''Live...and in Concert from San Francisco'' (Blues Express)\n*2009 ''Chicago Blues Festival 2001'' (P-Vine)\n\n=== Compilations ===\n*1969 ''Door To Door'' (Chess) (coupled with Albert King)\n*1989 ''I Can't Quit You Baby - The Cobra Sessions 1956-1958'' (P-Vine)\n*2000 ''Good 'Uns - The Classic Cobra Recordings 1956-1958'' (Westside)\n*2000 ''The Essential Otis Rush - The Classic Cobra Recordings 1956-1958'' (Fuel 2000)\n*2002 ''Blue on Blues - Buddy Guy & Otis Rush'' (Fuel 2000)\n*2005 ''All Your Love I Miss Loving - Live at the Wise Fools Pub, Chicago'' (Delmark)\n*2006 ''Live At Montreux 1986'' (Eagle Rock Entertainment)  (Joint performance with [[Eric Clapton]] and [[Luther Allison]])\n*2006 Blues Giants.
