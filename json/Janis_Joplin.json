She was one of the more popular acts at the [[Monterey Pop Festival]] and later became one of the major attractions to the [[Woodstock]] festival and the [[Festival Express]] train tour. Joplin charted five singles, and other popular songs from her four-year solo career include \"[[Down on Me]]\", \"[[Summertime (song)|Summertime]]\", \"[[Piece of My Heart]]\", \"[[Ball 'n' Chain]]\", \"[[Maybe (The Chantels song)|Maybe]]\", \"[[To Love Somebody (song)|To Love Somebody]]\", \"[[Kozmic Blues]]\", \"[[Work Me, Lord]]\", \"[[Cry Baby (song)|Cry Baby]]\", \"[[Mercedes Benz (song)|Mercedes Benz]]\", and her only number one hit, \"[[Me and Bobby McGee]]\".\n\nJoplin was well known for her performing abilities, and her fans referred to her stage presence as \"electric\". At the height of her career, she was known as \"The Queen of Psychedelic Soul,\" and became known as Pearl among her friends. She was also a painter, dancer and music arranger.

In 1964, Joplin and future [[Jefferson Airplane]] guitarist [[Jorma Kaukonen]] recorded a number of blues standards, further accompanied by Margareta Kaukonen on typewriter (as a percussion instrument). This session included seven tracks: \"Typewriter Talk\", \"Trouble in Mind\", \"Kansas City Blues\", \"[[Hesitation Blues]]\", \"[[Nobody Knows You When You're Down and Out]]\", \"Daddy, Daddy, Daddy\" and \"Long Black Train Blues\", and was later released as the [[bootleg recording|bootleg]] album ''The Typewriter Tape''.

In May 1965, Joplin's friends threw her a [[rent party|bus-fare party]] so she could return home.<ref name=\"scars\"/>\n\n===Back in Texas===\nBack in Port Arthur, she changed her lifestyle. She avoided drugs and alcohol, adopted a [[beehive (hairstyle)|beehive]] hairdo, and enrolled as an [[anthropology]] major at [[Lamar University]] in nearby [[Beaumont, Texas]]. During her year at Lamar University, she commuted to [[Austin, Texas|Austin]] to perform solo, accompanying herself on guitar. One of her performances was reviewed in the ''[[Austin American-Statesman]]''. Joplin became engaged to a man who visited her, wearing a blue [[serge]] suit, to ask her father for her hand in marriage, but the man terminated plans for the marriage soon afterwards.<ref name=\"buried\"/> Just prior to joining [[Big Brother and the Holding Company]], Joplin recorded seven studio tracks in 1965. Among the songs she recorded was her original composition for her song \"Turtle Blues\" and an alternate version of \"Cod'ine\" by [[Buffy Sainte-Marie]]. These tracks were later issued as a new album in 1995 entitled ''[[This is Janis Joplin 1965]]'' by James Gurley.\n\n==Big Brother and the Holding Company: 1966\u20131968==\n{{Main|Big Brother and the Holding Company}}\n[[File:Janis Joplin Big Brother and the Holding Company.jpg|thumb|Joplin with Big Brother and the Holding Company, circa 1966\u20131967.]]\nIn 1966, Joplin's bluesy vocal style attracted the attention of the [[psychedelic rock]] band [[Big Brother and the Holding Company]], a band that had gained some renown among the nascent [[hippie]] community in [[Haight-Ashbury]]. She was recruited to join the group by [[Chet Helms]], a promoter who had known her in Texas and who at the time was managing Big Brother. Helms brought her back to San Francisco and Joplin joined Big Brother on June 4, 1966.<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=June 13, 2010|url=http://www.wolfgangsvault.com/janis-joplin/|title=Janis Joplin|publisher=wolfgangsvault.com}}</ref> Her first public performance with them was at the [[Avalon Ballroom]] in San Francisco. In June, she was photographed at an outdoor concert that celebrated the summer solstice. The image, which was later published in two books by David Dalton, shows her before she relapsed into drugs. Due to persistent persuading by keyboardist and close friend Stephen Ryder, Joplin avoided drug use for several weeks, enjoining bandmate Dave Getz to promise that using needles would not be allowed in their rehearsal space or in her apartment or in the homes of her bandmates whom she visited.<ref name=\"buried\"/> When a visitor injected drugs in front of Joplin and Getz, Joplin angrily reminded Getz that he had broken his promise.<ref name=\"buried\"/> A San Francisco concert from that summer was recorded and released in the 1984 album ''Cheaper Thrills''.<!--this is Cheaper Thrills, 1984 album, ''not'' Cheap Thrills, which was released in 1968.

The band recorded tracks in a Chicago recording studio, but the label owner [[Bob Shad]] refused to pay their airfare back to San Francisco.<ref name=\"amburn\"/> Shortly after four of the five musicians drove from Chicago to Northern California with very little money (Albin traveled by plane), they returned to Lagunitas.

Two songs from the second of Big Brother's two sets at Monterey were filmed. \"Combination of the Two\" and a version of [[Big Mama Thornton]]'s \"[[Ball 'n' Chain]]\" appear in the DVD box set of [[D. A. Pennebaker]]'s documentary ''[[Monterey Pop]]'' released by [[The Criterion Collection]]. The film captured [[Cass Elliot]], of [[The Mamas & the Papas]], seated in the audience silently mouthing \"Wow! That's really heavy!\" during Joplin's performance of \"Ball and Chain\".<ref name=\"amburn\"/> Only \"Ball and Chain\" was included in the film that was released to theaters nationwide in 1969 and shown on television in the 1970s. Those who did not attend Monterey Pop saw the band's performance of \"Combination of the Two\" for the first time in 2002 when The Criterion Collection released the box set. After switching managers from Chet Helms to Julius Karpen in 1966, the group signed with top artist manager [[Albert Grossman]], whom they met for the first time at Monterey Pop. For the remainder of 1967, Big Brother performed mainly in California. On February 16, 1968,<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=June 13, 2010|url=http://www.bbhc.com/bbbase.html|title=Big Brother in Concert |publisher=bbhc.com}}</ref> the group began its first East Coast tour in Philadelphia, and the following day gave their first performance in New York City at the Anderson Theater.<ref name=\"scars\"/><ref name=\"amburn\"/> On April 7, 1968, the last day of their East Coast tour, Joplin and Big Brother performed with [[Jimi Hendrix]], [[Buddy Guy]], [[Joni Mitchell]], [[Richie Havens]], [[Paul Butterfield]], and [[Elvin Bishop]] at the \"Wake for [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]]\" concert in New York.\n\n''[[Live at Winterland '68]]'', recorded at the [[Winterland Ballroom]] on April 12 and 13, 1968, features Joplin and Big Brother and the Holding Company at the height of their mutual career working through a selection of tracks from their albums. A recording became available to the public for the first time in 1998 when [[Sony Music Entertainment]] released the compact disc. One month later, [[Owsley Stanley]] recorded them at the Carousel Ballroom, released as ''[[Live at the Carousel Ballroom 1968]]'' in 2012. In early 1968, Joplin and Big Brother made their nationwide television debut on ''[[The Dick Cavett Show]]'', an [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] daytime variety show hosted by [[Dick Cavett]]. Shortly thereafter, network employees [[wiping|wiped]] the videotape. Over the next two years, she made three appearances on the primetime Cavett program, and all were preserved. By 1968, the band was being billed as \"Janis Joplin and Big Brother and the Holding Company\",<ref name=\"dalton\"/> and the media coverage given to Joplin generated resentment within the band.<ref name=\"dalton\"/> The other members of Big Brother thought that Joplin was on a \"star trip\", while others were telling Joplin that Big Brother was a terrible band and that she ought to dump them.<ref name=\"dalton\"/> ''Time'' magazine called Joplin \"probably the most powerful singer to emerge from the white rock movement\", and [[Richard Goldstein (writer born 1944)|Richard Goldstein]] wrote for the May 1968 issue of ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'' magazine that Joplin was \"the most staggering leading woman in rock... she slinks like tar, scowls like war... clutching the knees of a final stanza, begging it not to leave... Janis Joplin can sing the chic off any listener.\"<ref name=\"jacobson\"/>\n\n===''Cheap Thrills''===\n\nFor her first major studio recording, Janis played a major role in the arrangement and production of the recordings that would become Big Brother and the Holding Company's second album, ''[[Cheap Thrills (Big Brother and the Holding Company album)|Cheap Thrills]]''. During the recording, Joplin was said to be the first person to enter the studio and the last person to leave. Footage of Joplin and the band in the studio shows Joplin in great form and taking charge during the recording for \"Summertime\". The album featured a cover design by [[counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture]] cartoonist [[Robert Crumb]]. Although ''Cheap Thrills'' sounded as if it consisted of concert recordings, like on \"Combination of the Two\" and \"I Need a Man to Love\", only \"Ball and Chain\" was actually recorded in front of a paying audience; the rest of the tracks were studio recordings.<ref name=\"scars\"/> The album had a raw quality, including the sound of a cocktail glass breaking and the broken shards being swept away during the song \"Turtle Blues\". ''Cheap Thrills'' produced very popular hits with \"[[Piece of My Heart]]\" and \"Summertime\". Together with the premiere of the documentary film ''Monterey Pop'' at New York's [[Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts]] on December 26, 1968,<ref>{{cite news |title=Screen: Upbeat Musical; 'Monterey Pop' Views the Rock Scene |last=Adler |first=Renata |date=December 27, 1968 |work=The New York Times |page=44}}</ref> the album launched Joplin's successful, albeit short, musical career.<ref name=\"craig\">{{Cite book |title=The Billboard Book of Number One Albums: The Inside Story Behind Pop Music's Blockbuster Records |author=Rosen, Craig |work= |year=1996 |isbn=0-8230-7586-9 }}</ref> ''Cheap Thrills'' reached No. 1 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] album chart eight weeks after its release, remaining for eight (nonconsecutive) weeks.<ref name=\"craig\"/> The album was certified gold at release and sold over a million copies in the first month of its release.<ref name=\"buried\">{{Cite book|title=Buried Alive: The Biography of Janis Joplin|author=Friedman, Myra|publisher=[[Crown Publishing Group]]|date=September 15, 1992|isbn=0-517-58650-9}}</ref><ref name=\"dalton\"/> The lead single from the album, \"Piece of My Heart\", reached No. 12 on the [[Billboard Hot 100]] in the fall of 1968.<ref name=\"heartchart\">{{cite web|title=Big Brother & The Holding Company: Charts & Awards|publisher=Allmusic|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/big-brother-the-holding-company-p3670/charts-awards/billboard-singles|accessdate=August 10, 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe band made another East Coast tour during July\u2013August 1968, performing at the [[Columbia Records]] convention in [[Puerto Rico]] and the [[Newport Folk Festival]]. After returning to San Francisco for two hometown shows at the [[Palace of Fine Arts]] Festival on August 31 and September 1, Joplin announced that she would be leaving Big Brother. On September 14, 1968, culminating a three-night final gig together at Fillmore West, fans thronged to a concert that [[Bill Graham (promoter)]] publicized as the last official concert of Janis Joplin with Big Brother and the Holding Company. The opening acts on this night were [[Chicago (band)|Chicago]] (then still called Chicago Transit Authority) and [[Santana (band)|Santana]]. But the band toured the United States that fall. Two performances at a [[roller rink]] in [[Alexandria, Virginia]], at a time when the [[Washington, D.C.]] area's hard rock scene was in its infancy, were reviewed by John Segraves of the ''Evening Star''.<ref name=\"Segraves B6\">{{cite news|title=Janis Joplin Overwhelms|last=Segraves|first=John|date=October 21, 1968|publisher=''Evening Star Washington, D.C.''|pages=B6}}</ref> An opera buff at the time,<ref>[http://vintagenewera.com/vintage/whoconcert.html Scroll down 80 percent of the way for citation that John Segraves was an opera buff when he reviewed a Who concert in D.C. in 1969]</ref> he wrote, \"Miss Joplin, in her early 20s, has been for the last year or two the vocalist with Big Brother and the Holding Company, a rock quintet of superior electric expertise.

The band was influenced by the [[Stax Records|Stax-Volt]] [[rhythm and blues]] (R&B) bands of the 1960s, as exemplified by [[Otis Redding]] and [[the Bar-Kays]].<ref name=\"scars\"/><ref name=\"amburn\"/><ref name=\"buried\"/> The Stax-Volt R&B sound was typified by the use of horns and had a more bluesy, funky, soul, pop-oriented sound than most of the hard-rock psychedelic bands of the period. By early 1969, Joplin was allegedly shooting at least $200 worth of heroin per day,<ref name=\"caserta\"/> although efforts were made to keep her clean during the recording of ''[[I Got Dem Ol' Kozmic Blues Again Mama!]]''. Gabriel Mekler, who produced the ''Kozmic Blues'', told publicist-turned-biographer Myra Friedman after Joplin's death that the singer had lived in his house during the June 1969 recording sessions at his insistence so he could keep her away from drugs and her drug-using friends.<ref name=\"buried\"/> Joplin's appearances with the Kozmic Blues Band in Europe were released in cinemas in the documentary ''[[Janis (film)|Janis]]'', which was reviewed by the ''[[Washington Post]]'' on March 21, 1975.<ref>{{cite news|title='Janis': Purified Joplin|last=Zito|first=Tom|date=21 March 1975|publisher=''Washington Post''|pages=B11}}</ref> The film shows Joplin arriving in [[Frankfurt]] by plane and waiting inside a bus next to the Frankfurt venue while an American fan who is visiting Germany expresses enthusiasm to the camera.\n\n[[File:Janis Joplin Tom Jones 1969.JPG|thumb|Joplin performs with [[Tom Jones (singer)|Tom Jones]] on [[This is Tom Jones|his television show]] in late 1969.]]\n\nNo security was used in Frankfurt so by the end of the concert the stage was so packed with people that the band members could not see each other. Another film was made of the band's performance in [[Stockholm]] featuring Joplin's interpretation of \"[[Summertime (song)|Summertime]]\". The ''Janis'' documentary also includes interviews with her in Stockholm and from her visit to [[London]] for her gig at [[Royal Albert Hall]]. After appearing on German television, the Kozmic Blues Band performed on several American television shows with Joplin. On the [[This Is Tom Jones|Tom Jones television show]], they performed \"Little Girl Blue\" and \"Raise Your Hand\", the latter with [[Tom Jones (singer)|Jones]] singing a duet with Joplin. On one episode of ''[[The Dick Cavett Show]]'', they performed \"Try (Just a Little Bit Harder)\" as well as \"To Love Somebody.\" As [[Dick Cavett]] interviewed Joplin, she admitted that she had a terrible time touring in Europe, claiming that audiences there are very uptight and don't [[get down]]. She also revealed that she was a big fan of [[Tina Turner]], saying that she was an incredible singer, dancer and show woman. Joplin and Turner also performed together on at least one occasion at [[Madison Square Garden]].\n\n===''I Got Dem Ol' Kozmic Blues Again Mama!''===\nThe ''Kozmic Blues'' album, released in September 1969, was certified gold later that year, but did not match the success of ''Cheap Thrills''.<ref name=\"craig\"/> Reviews of the new group were mixed. However, the recording quality and engineering of the record as well as the musicianship were considered superior to her previous releases, and some music critics argued that the band was working in a much more constructive way to support Joplin's sensational vocal talents. Joplin wanted a horn section similar to [[Chicago (band)|Chicago Transit Authority]]'s; her voice had the dynamic qualities and range not to be overpowered by the brighter horn sound.{{citation needed|date = January 2013}}\n\nSome music critics, including [[Ralph J. Gleason]] of the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'', were negative. Gleason wrote that the new band was a \"drag\" and Joplin should \"scrap\" her new band and \"go right back to being a member of Big Brother...(if they'll have her).\"<ref name=\"scars\"/>\n\nOther reviewers, such as reporter [[Carl Bernstein]] of the ''[[Washington Post]]'', generally ignored the band's flaws and devoted entire articles to celebrating the singer's magic. In general the press concentrated more on her leaving Big Brother rather than the qualities of the new recording.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}\n\nColumbia Records released \"[[Kozmic Blues]]\" as a single, which peaked at #41 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100, and a live rendition of \"Raise Your Hand\" was released in Germany and became a top ten hit there. Containing other hits like \"Try (Just a Little Bit Harder)\", \"[[To Love Somebody (song)|To Love Somebody]]\", and \"[[Little Girl Blue (song)|Little Girl Blue]]\", ''I Got Dem Ol' Kozmic Blues Again Mama!'' reached No. 5 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] soon after its release.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}\n\n===Woodstock===\nJoplin appeared at [[Woodstock]] in the late hours of Saturday, August 16, 1969. She performed until the early morning hours of Sunday, August 17. Despite her not even knowing of the festival's existence,{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} the Woodstock promoters were advertising her as a headliner. She thus became one of the main attractions of the historic concert. Her friend, [[Peggy Caserta]], claimed in a 1973 book that she had encouraged a reluctant Joplin to perform at Woodstock. Joplin informed her band that they would be performing at the concert as if it were just another gig. When she and the band were flown in by helicopter with the pregnant [[Joan Baez]] and her mother from a nearby motel to the festival site and Joplin saw the enormous crowd, she instantly became incredibly nervous and giddy. Upon landing and getting off the helicopter, Joplin was approached by reporters asking her questions. She deferred them to Caserta as she was too excited to speak. Initially Joplin was eager to get on the stage and perform, but she kept getting delayed as bands were contractually obliged to perform before her. Faced with a ten-hour wait after arriving at the backstage area, she shot heroin<ref name=\"amburn\"/><ref name=\"caserta\"/> with Caserta and was drinking alcohol, so by the time she hit the stage, she was \"three sheets to the wind\".<ref name=\"scars\"/> Joplin took the stage following [[Creedence Clearwater Revival]]. On stage her voice became slightly hoarse and wheezy and she found it hard to dance.\n\nThroughout her performance she frequently spoke to the crowd, asking them if they had everything they needed and if they were staying stoned. She pulled through, however, and the audience was so pleased they cheered her on for an encore, to which she replied and sang \"Ball and Chain.\" Her performances of \"[[Kozmic Blues]]\" and \"Work Me, Lord\" at Woodstock are notable, though her voice breaks while she sings.\n\n[[Pete Townshend]], who performed with [[The Who]] later in the same morning after Joplin finished, witnessed her performance and said the following in his 2012 memoir: \"She had been amazing at Monterey, but tonight she wasn't at her best, due, probably, to the long delay, and probably, too, to the amount of booze and heroin she'd consumed while she waited. But even Janis on an off-night was incredible.\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Townshend|first=Pete  |title=Who I am: a memoir|publisher=HarperCollins Publishers|year=2012|pages=179}}</ref>\n\nJanis remained at Woodstock for the remainder of the festival. She is said{{by whom|date=January 2013}} to have really enjoyed [[Sly and The Family Stone]]'s performance, who came on immediately after her. [[Joan Baez]] also revealed in her autobiography that she and Joplin witnessed [[list of performances and events at Woodstock Festival#Sunday, August 17 to Monday, August 18|Hendrix's close-of-show performance]] from [[Joe Cocker]]'s van.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}\n\nStill photographs in color show Joplin backstage with [[Grace Slick]] the day after Joplin's performance, wherein Joplin appears to be very happy. However, Joplin was ultimately unhappy with her performance and blamed Caserta. Her singing was not included (by her own insistence) in the documentary film or the soundtrack, ''[[Woodstock: Music from the Original Soundtrack and More]]'', although the 25th anniversary director's cut of ''[[Woodstock (film)|Woodstock]]'' includes her performance of \"Work Me, Lord\". The documentary film of the festival that was released to theaters in 1970 includes, on the left side of a [[split screen (filmmaking)|split screen]], 37 seconds of footage of Joplin and Caserta walking toward her dressing room tent.<ref>{{YouTube|id=kvLno-hy_jE#t=1m44s|title=Footage of Joplin and Caserta begins at 1:44 and ends at 2:21}}.</ref> Laura Joplin said in an interview that her older sister went straight home to Port Arthur following Woodstock. She was incredibly vibrant and happy after coming home and really loved the festival. She told her family how great it was, but her mother and father remained distant on the subject as they did not really understand the hippie movement.\n\n===Madison Square Garden===\nIn addition to Woodstock, Joplin also had problems at [[Madison Square Garden]] in 1969. Biographer Myra Friedman claimed to have witnessed a duet Joplin sang with Tina Turner during a concert by [[The Rolling Stones]] at the Garden on [[Thanksgiving Day]]. Friedman described Joplin during this performance as \"so drunk, so stoned, so out of control, that she could have been an institutionalized psychotic rent by mania.\"<ref name=\"buried\"/> During a Garden concert where she got solo billing on December 19, some observers believed she tried to incite the audience to riot.<ref name=\"buried\"/> For part of this concert she was joined onstage by special guests [[Johnny Winter]] and [[Paul Butterfield]].\n\nJoplin told rock journalist David Dalton that Garden audiences watched and listened to \"every note [she sang] with 'Is she gonna make it?' in their eyes.\"<ref name=\"dalton\"/> In her interview with Dalton she added that she felt most comfortable performing at small, cheap venues in San Francisco that were associated with the counterculture. At the time of this June 1970 interview she already had performed in the Bay Area for what turned out to be the last time. [[Sam Andrew]], the lead guitarist who had left Big Brother with Joplin in December 1968 to form her back-up band, quit in late summer 1969 and returned to Big Brother without her. At the end of the year, the Kozmic Blues Band broke up. Their final gig with Joplin was the one at Madison Square Garden with Winter and Butterfield.<ref name=\"scars\"/><ref name=\"dalton\">{{Cite book|title=Piece Of My Heart|author=Dalton, David|publisher=[[Da Capo Press]]|date=August 21, 1991|isbn=0-306-80446-8}}</ref>\n\n===Full Tilt Boogie Band===\nIn February 1970, Joplin traveled to Brazil, where she stopped her drug and alcohol use. She was accompanied on vacation there by her friend Linda Gravenites, who had designed the singer's stage costumes from 1967 to 1969. Joplin was romanced by a fellow American tourist named David (George) Niehaus, who was traveling around the world. A Joplin biography written by her sister Laura said, \"David was an upper-middle-class Cincinnati kid who had studied communications at Notre Dame. ... [and] had joined the Peace Corps after college and worked in a small village in Turkey. ... He tried law school, but when he met Janis he was taking time off.\"<ref name=\"Joplin, Laura\">{{Cite book|title=Love, Janis |author=Joplin, Laura|publisher=[[HarperCollins]]|date=August 16, 2005|isbn=0-06-075522-9}}</ref> Niehaus and Joplin were photographed by the press at [[Rio Carnival]] in Rio de Janeiro.<ref name=\"dalton\"/> Gravenites also took color photographs of the two during their Brazilian vacation. According to Joplin biographer Ellis Amburn, in Gravenites' snapshots they \"look like a carefree, happy, healthy young couple having a tremendously good time.\"<ref name=\"amburn\"/> ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine interviewed Joplin during an international phone call, quoting her: \"I'm going into the jungle with a big bear of a beatnik named David Niehaus. I finally remembered I don't have to be on stage twelve months a year. I've decided to go and dig some other jungles for a couple of weeks.\"<ref name=\"amburn\"/> Amburn added in 1992, \"Janis was trying to kick heroin in Brazil, and one of the nicest things about George was that he wasn't into drugs.\"<ref name=\"amburn\"/>\n\n[[File:Janis Joplin 1970.JPG|left|upright|thumb|Janis Joplin 1970| \"I'm not really thinking much, just sort of, trying to feel\" -Joplin,  having been asked by [[Dick Cavett]] what she thought about when she sang.]]\n\nJoplin began using heroin again when she returned to the United States. Her relationship with Niehaus soon ended because of him witnessing her shooting drugs at her new home in [[Larkspur, California]], her romantic relationship with Peggy Caserta, who also was an intravenous addict, and her refusal to take some time off work and travel the world with him.<ref name=\"amburn\"/><ref>{{cite web|author=GlennGarvin - [miamiherald.com] |url=http://www.janisjoplin.net/news/83/48/Bandmate-recalls-Janis-Joplin-s-big-appetite-in-TV-doc/ |title=Janis Joplin News Articles - Kozmic Blues |publisher=Janisjoplin.net |date=2007-11-06 |accessdate=2011-12-30}}</ref> Around this time she formed her new band, the [[Full Tilt Boogie Band]].<ref name=\"scars\"/><ref name=\"amburn\"/><ref name=\"buried\"/> The band was composed mostly of young Canadian musicians and featured an organ, but no horn section. Joplin took a more active role in putting together the Full Tilt Boogie Band than she did with her prior group. She was quoted as saying, \"It's ''my'' band. Finally it's ''my'' band!\"<ref name=\"scars\"/>\n\nThe Full Tilt Boogie Band began touring in May 1970. Joplin remained quite happy with her new group, which received mostly positive feedback from both her fans and the critics.<ref name=\"scars\"/> Prior to beginning a summer tour with Full Tilt Boogie, she performed in a reunion with Big Brother at the [[Fillmore West]] in San Francisco on April 4, 1970. Recordings from this concert were included in an in-concert album released posthumously in 1972. She again appeared with Big Brother on April 12 at [[Winterland]] where she and Big Brother were reported to be in excellent form.<ref name=\"amburn\"/> It was around this time that Joplin began wearing multi-coloured feather boas in her hair. By the time she began touring with Full Tilt Boogie, Joplin told people she was drug-free, but her drinking increased.<ref name=\"amburn\"/>\n\n===Festival Express===\n[[File:Janis Joplin Szl\u00e1vics.jpg|right|thumb|Janis Joplin sculpture (copper, sheet, 62cm) in [[Budapest]]'s Ferenc Erkel Grade School, [[Hungary]], sculptor: [[L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Szl\u00e1vics, Jr.]]]]\nFrom June 28 to July 4, 1970, Joplin and Full Tilt Boogie joined the all-star ''[[Festival Express]]'' train tour through Canada, performing alongside [[Buddy Guy]], [[The Band]], [[Ten Years After]], [[Grateful Dead]], [[Delaney and Bonnie]], [[Eric Andersen]], and [[Ian & Sylvia]].<ref name=\"amburn\"/> They played concerts in [[Toronto]], [[Winnipeg]] and [[Calgary]].<ref name=\"amburn\"/><ref name=\"dalton\"/> Janis jammed with the other performers on the train and her performances on this tour are considered to be among her greatest.\n\nJoplin persuaded [[The Band]], who originally did not want to perform, to do so telling them it was going to be a great party.\n\nJoplin headlined the festival on all three nights. At the last stop in Calgary, Janis took to the stage with [[Jerry Garcia]] while her band was tuning up. She told the audience how great the tour was and presented the organisers with a case of tequila. She then burst into a two-hour set, starting with \"[[Tell Mama (song)|Tell Mama]]\". Throughout this performance, Janis went into several banters where she spoke about her failed love life. She finished the night with long versions of ''Get It While You Can'' and ''Ball and Chain''.\n\nFootage of her performance of the song ''Tell Mama'' in Calgary became an MTV video in the early 1980s and the sound was included on the 1982 ''[[Farewell Song]]'' album. The audio of other Festival Express performances was included on that 1972 Joplin ''In Concert'' album. Video of the performances was included on the ''[[Festival Express]]'' DVD. Her full performances of Festival Express exist and have been released on bootlegs but all footage has yet to be released. In the ''Tell Mama'' video shown on MTV in the 1980s, Joplin wore a psychedelically colored loose-fitting costume and feathers in her hair. This was her standard stage costume in the spring and summer of 1970. She chose the new costumes after her friend and designer, Linda Gravenites (whom Joplin had praised in the May 1968 issue of ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]''), cut ties with Joplin shortly after their return from Brazil, due largely to Joplin's continued use of heroin.<ref name=\"scars\"/><ref name=\"amburn\"/>\n\nDuring the ''Festival Express'' tour, Joplin was accompanied by ''Rolling Stone'' writer David Dalton, who later wrote several articles and two books on Joplin. She told Dalton:\n\n{{quote|I'm a victim of my own insides. There was a time when I wanted to know everything ... It used to make me very unhappy, all that feeling. I just didn't know what to do with it. But now I've learned to make that feeling work ''for'' me. I'm full of emotion and I want a release, and if you're on stage and if it's really working and you've got the audience with you, it's a ''oneness'' you feel.<ref name=\"dalton\"/>}}\n\n===''Pearl''===\n{{Main|Pearl (album)}}\nAmong her last public appearances were two broadcasts of ''[[The Dick Cavett Show]]''. In a June 25, 1970 appearance, she announced that she would attend her ten-year high-school class reunion.

Rothchild]], who had produced recordings for [[The Doors]]. Although Joplin died before all the tracks were fully completed, there was still enough usable material to compile a long-playing record.\n\nThe result of the sessions was the posthumously released ''[[Pearl (album)|Pearl]]'' (1971). It became the biggest selling album of her career<ref name=\"craig\"/> and featured her biggest hit single, a cover of [[Kris Kristofferson]]'s \"[[Me and Bobby McGee]]\". Kristofferson had been Joplin's lover in the spring of 1970.<ref>Anthony DeCurtis, ''Rolling Stone'', September 30, 1999</ref> The opening track, \"Move Over\", was written by Joplin, reflecting the way that she felt men treated women in relationships. Also included was the social commentary of the [[a cappella]] \"[[Mercedes Benz (song)|Mercedes Benz]]\", written by Joplin, [[Bob Neuwirth]] and [[Beat Generation|Beat poet]] [[Michael McClure]]. The track on the album features the first and only take that Joplin recorded. The track ''Buried Alive In The Blues'', to which Joplin had been scheduled to add her vocals on the day she was found dead, was included as an instrumental. In 2003, ''Pearl'' was ranked No. 122 on ''Rolling Stone'' magazine's list of the [[Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time|500 Greatest Albums of All Time]].\n\nJoplin checked into the Landmark Motor Hotel in Hollywood on August 24, 1970,<ref>''[[Los Angeles Herald Examiner]]'' October 5, 1970, front page.</ref> near [[Sunset Sound Recorders]],<ref name=\"amburn\"/> where she began rehearsing and recording her album.

Music historian Tom Moon wrote that Joplin had \"a devastatingly original voice\". Music columnist [[Jon Pareles]] of the ''[[New York Times]]'' wrote that Joplin as an artist was \"overpowering and deeply vulnerable\". Author [[Megan Terry]] claimed that Joplin was the female version of [[Elvis Presley]] in her ability to captivate an audience.<ref name=\"Joplin's Shooting Star\"/>\n\nIn 1973, a book about Joplin by her publicist Myra Friedman was excerpted in many newspapers. At the same time, ''Going Down With Janis'' by Peggy Caserta attracted a lot of attention with its opening line, which referred to her performing a sex act with Joplin while they were high on heroin in September 1970. Joplin's bandmate Sam Andrew would later describe Caserta as \"halfway between a [[groupie]] and a friend\".<ref name=\"amburn\"/> According to an early 1990s statement by a close friend of Caserta and Joplin, Caserta's book angered the Los Angeles heroin dealer she described (including the make and model of his car) in detail to her readers.

[[Leonard Cohen]]'s 1974 song \"[[New Skin for the Old Ceremony#Songs|Chelsea Hotel #2]]\" is about Joplin.<ref>{{cite web | url= http://www.webheights.net/speakingcohen/bbctrans.htm | title= Leonard Cohen on BBC Radio | publisher=webheights.net}}</ref> Likewise, lyricist [[Robert Hunter (lyricist)|Robert Hunter]] has commented that [[Jerry Garcia]]'s \"Birdsong\" from his first solo album, ''[[Garcia (album)|Garcia]]'', is about Joplin and the end of her suffering through death.<ref>[{{Allmusic|class=song|id=t844146|pure_url=yes}} AllMusic.com]</ref><ref>''Box of Rain: Lyrics 1965\u20131993'' by Robert Hunter, Penguin Books, 1993</ref> [[Mimi Farina]]'s composition \"In the Quiet Morning\", most famously covered by [[Joan Baez]] on her 1972 ''[[Come from the Shadows]]'' album, was a tribute to Joplin.<ref>Performed by [[Joan Baez]] in her 1972 album ''[[Come from the Shadows]]''. Baez wrote the song \"Blessed Are...\", from her 1971 album of the same name, as a tribute to Joplin.</ref> Another song by Baez, \"Children Of The Eighties\", mentioned Joplin. A 1978 [[Serge Gainsbourg]]-penned song in French by English singer [[Jane Birkin]], \"Ex fan des sixties\" references Joplin alongside other disappeared \"idols\" such as [[Jimi Hendrix]], [[Brian Jones]] or [[Marc Bolan]]. [[Country Joe McDonald]] wrote a song called \"Janis\" from the album ''[[I-Feel-Like-I'm-Fixin'-to-Die]]''\n\nAt the 1976 [[Montreux Jazz Festival]], [[Nina Simone]], whom Joplin admired greatly, commented on Joplin:\n{{quote|\nYou know I made thirty-five albums, they bootlegged seventy. Oh, everybody took a chunk of me. And yesterday I went to see Janis Joplin's film here. And what distressed me the most, and I started to write a song about it, but I decided you weren't worthy. Because I figured that most of you are here for the festival. Anyway the point is it pained me to see how hard she worked. Because she got hooked into a thing, and it wasn't on drugs. She got hooked into a feeling and she played to corpses.}}\n\nSimone also included Joplin in her song \"Stars\", and opened her act with a rendition of \"[[Little Girl Blue (song)|Little Girl Blue]]\".\n\nThe 1979 film ''[[The Rose (film)|The Rose]]'' was loosely based on Joplin's life. Originally called ''Pearl'' - Joplin's nickname, and the title of [[Pearl (album)|her last album]] \u2013 it was fictionalized after her family declined to allow the producers the rights to her story.<ref name=guardian>Elan, Priya.

Opening in the summer of 2001 and scheduled for only a few weeks of performances, the show won acclaim and packed houses and was held over several times, the demanding role of the singing Janis attracting rock vocalists from relative unknowns to pop stars [[Laura Branigan]] and [[Beth Hart]]. A national tour followed.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}\n\nIn 2006, [[Marty Angelo]], band manager for [[Raven (American band)|Raven]], wrote about an experience he had with Janis in his book, ''Once Life Matters: A New Beginning''.<ref>Impact Publishers, 2005-2006, ISBN 0-9618954-4-6</ref> It seems Joplin loved the sound of Angelo's band after hearing them perform on numerous nights at Steve Paul's popular NYC nightclub, the Scene. When the band played at Ungano's Night Club in Manhattan in 1968, Joplin arrived with an entourage which included three professional tape recorders. She wanted to capture Raven's sound. That did not go over well with the members of the band, and they insisted Joplin not be allowed to record their show. The band's manager, Marty Angelo, asked club owner Nick Ungano to step in. Ungano did not want to mess with Joplin but reluctantly agreed. Ungano blamed the entire fiasco on Angelo telling Joplin that Raven's manager demanded she not be allowed to record.  Ungano also told Joplin that Angelo was refusing to allow the band to go on stage until all recorders were removed from the club. \"Manager?\" Joplin screamed. She then exploded with a barrage of profanity, insisting that Ungano tell Angelo to \"go fuck himself\" and stormed out of the club along with her tape recorders. Angelo later became friends with Joplin and helped her acquire organist, Richard Kermode, for her \"Kozmic Blues Band.\"\n\nThere have been many attempts at making a film about Joplin.

[[Pink (singer)|Pink]], aka Alecia Moore, says Janis Joplin was her ultimate influence. Pink has performed a live version of a Janis Joplin medley, which can be seen on her 'Live in Europe' DVD. She talks about how Janis represented 'Freedom'. Pink is often described as possessing similar characteristics as Janis, such as: a hoarse, husky sounding voice and even the same laugh. Pink has once stated: \"I would love to play her (Janis) in a movie\".  [[Florence Welch]] of [[Florence and The Machine]] spoke of Joplin's impact on her own musical prowess in an interview for ''Why Music Matters'' in a commercial against piracy:\n{{quote| I learnt about Janis from an anthology of female blues singers. Janis was a fascinating character who bridged the gap between psychedelic blues and soul scenes. She was so vulnerable, self-conscious and full of suffering. She tore herself apart yet on stage she was totally different. She was so unrestrained, so free, so raw and she wasn't afraid to wail. Her connection with the audience was really important. It seems to me the suffering and intensity of her performance go hand in hand. There was always a sense of longing, of searching for something. I think she really sums up the idea that soul is about putting your pain into something beautiful.<ref>{{cite web|title=Florence and The Machine on Janis Joplin|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cr7BNDFidog|work=Whymusicmatters.com|publisher=Why Music Matters|accessdate=3 July 2013}}</ref>}}\n\n[[Stevie Nicks]] considers Joplin one of her idols, saying: {{quote| You could say that being yelled at by Janis Joplin was one of the great honors of my life. Early in my career, Lindsey Buckingham and I were in a band called Fritz. There were two gigs we played in San Francisco that changed everything for me - One was opening up for Jimi Hendrix, who was completely magical. The other was the time that we opened up for Janis at the San Jose Fairgrounds, around 1970.\n\nIt was a hot summer day, and things didn't start off well because the entire show was running late. That meant our set was running over. We were onstage and going over pretty well, when I turned and saw a furious Janis Joplin on the side of the stage, yelling at us. She was screaming something like, \"What the fuck are you assholes doing? Get the hell off of my stage.\" Actually, she might have even been a little cruder than that \u2014 it was hard to hear.\n\nBut then Janis got up on that stage with her band, and this woman who was screaming at me only moments before suddenly became my new hero. Janis Joplin was not what anyone would call a great beauty, but she became beautiful because she made such a powerful and deep emotional connection with the audience. I didn't mind the feathers and the bell-bottom pants either. Janis didn't dress like anyone else, and she definitely didn't sing like anyone else.\n\nJanis put herself out there completely, and her voice was not only strong and soulful, it was painfully and beautifully real. She sang in the great tradition of the rhythm & blues singers that were her heroes, but she brought her own dangerous, sexy rock & roll edge to every single song. She really gave you a piece of her heart. And that inspired me to find my own voice and my own style.<ref>CD Liner Notes - Big Brother and the Holding Company's (Joplin's band) Live at Winterland '68</ref>}}\n\n==Discography==\nJanis Joplin recorded four fully conceived studio albums in her career. Her first two albums were recorded with and fully credited to [[Big Brother and the Holding Company]] and the later two being solo albums. Previously unreleased studio and live material were added to these albums tracklistings and also released on the compilation ''[[Farewell Song]]'' in 1982. Joplin's early performances from when she was a folk-blues singer have been released on several well-received compilations through the years, one such compilation is the nine disc ''[[Blow All My Blues Away]]''. In 2012, ''[[The Pearl Sessions]]'' were released giving an insight into her creative process.\n\nAs a popular psychedelic act of the late 1960s, many of Joplin's live concerts with Big Brother were professionally recorded and have been released on albums like ''[[Live at Winterland '68]]'' and ''[[Live at the Carousel Ballroom 1968]]''.\n\nThough most of her concerts were recorded during her solo career, few have been officially released, resulting in heavy bootlegging.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}\n\n===Studio albums===\n* ''[[Big Brother and the Holding Company (album)|Big Brother and the Holding Company]]'' (1967)\n* ''[[Cheap Thrills (Big Brother and the Holding Company album)|Cheap Thrills]]'' (1968) 2x Platinum\n* ''[[I Got Dem Ol' Kozmic Blues Again Mama!]]'' (1969) Platinum\n* ''[[Pearl (album)|Pearl]]'' (1971) 4x Platinum\n\n===Full discography===\n; [[Big Brother and the Holding Company]]\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
