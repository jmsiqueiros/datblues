However, Rev. Duskin lived to the age of 105, and Joe found alternative employment as a [[police officer]] and a [[postal worker]].<ref name=\"AMG\"/> Therefore Duskin, effectively in the middle of his career, never played a [[keyboard instrument|keyboard]] for sixteen years.<ref name=\"Guardian\"/>\n\nWith the encouragement of a blues historian, Steven C. Tracy, by the early 1970s Duskin had began playing the piano at [[music festival|festivals]] in the [[United States|US]] and across [[Europe]]. By 1978, and with the reputation for his concert playing now growing, his first recording, ''Cincinnati Stomp'', was released on [[Arhoolie Records]].<ref name=\"AMG\"/> The album contained Duskin's [[cover version]] of the track, \"[[Down the Road a Piece]]\" <ref>{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r54070|pure_url=yes}} |title=Allmusic ((( ''Cincinnati Stomp'' > Overview ))) |accessdate=2010-01-07}}</ref> and featured [[Muddy Waters]]' guitarist [[Bob Margolin]].\n\nHe subsequently toured both [[Austria]] and [[Germany]], and in 1987 made his inaugural visit to the [[United Kingdom|UK]].<ref name=\"Guardian\"/> The same year his part in John Jeremy's [[film]], ''Boogie Woogie Special'', recorded  for ''[[The South Bank Show]]'', increased Duskin's profile.<ref name=\"Guardian\"/><ref name=\"russell\"/> In 1988, accompanied by the guitar-playing [[Dave Peabody]], Duskin recorded his second album, ''Don't Mess with the Boogie Man''.<ref name=\"Guardian\"/> In the following decade, Duskin performed at both the [[New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival]] and the [[Chicago Blues Festival]].<ref name=\"AMG\"/> \n\nHis touring in Europe continued before he recorded his final album at the Quai du Blues in [[Neuilly]], [[France]].<ref name=\"Guardian\"/> Several Duskin albums were issued on European labels in the 1980s and 1990s.

When he first knew that I was playing piano, he said 'Don't you never play that devil's music in here. I'll tear you up if I catch you playing that.'..[Years later, his father discovered him playing the blues.]...The old man come in there and jumped on me. Now, when he got done whipping me, I said, 'Pop, you might as well get with it. This is what I want to do.' He looked at me and said, 'Joe, I'm 89 years old. I'm not going to live too long. Why don't you just make an agreement with me not to play the devil's music till I'm dead in the grave?' Well, I shook his hand and I never played a lick. And the old man died at 105.\"<ref name=\"Guardian\"/>}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.bigjoeduskin.org/ Big Joe Duskin website and Foundation]\n*[{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p10478/biography|pure_url=yes}} Biography] at [[Allmusic]]\n\n{{Authority control|VIAF=3951877}}\n\n{{Persondata         <!-- Metadata: see [[Wikipedia:Persondata]] -->\n| NAME              =Duskin, Big Joe\n| ALTERNATIVE NAMES =Duskin, Joseph L.\n| SHORT DESCRIPTION =[[United States|American]] [[blues]] and [[boogie-woogie]] pianist\n| DATE OF BIRTH     =February 10, 1921\n| PLACE OF BIRTH    =[[Collegeville, Alabama]], United States\n| DATE OF DEATH     =May 6, 2007\n| PLACE OF DEATH    =[[Avondale, Ohio]], United States\n}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Duskin, Big Joe}}\n[[Category:1921 births]]\n[[Category:2007 deaths]]\n[[Category:American blues pianists]]\n[[Category:American blues singers]]\n[[Category:Songwriters from Alabama]]\n[[Category:Boogie-woogie pianists]]\n[[Category:Deaths from diabetes]]\n[[Category:Jazz-blues pianists]]\n[[Category:Musicians from Birmingham, Alabama]]"}]}}}}
