A younger contemporary of [[Blind Willie McTell]], [[Curley Weaver]] and [[Barbecue Bob]], Moss was part of a coterie of [[Atlanta]] bluesmen, and among the few of his era who had been involved in the [[List of blues revival musicians|blues revival]] of the 1960s and 1970s. A guitarist of uncommon skill and dexterity with a strong voice, he began as a musical disciple of [[Blind Blake]], and may well have served as an influence on the later Piedmont-style guitarist [[Blind Boy Fuller]]. Although his career was halted in 1935 by a six-year jail term, and then by the [[Second World War]], Moss lived long enough to be rediscovered in the 1960s, when he revealed his talent had persevered throughout the years. He was reputed to have been cankerous and mistrusting of others, the extent to which this is a case is subjective.\n\nIn later years, Moss credited friend and band-mate [[Barbecue Bob]] with being a major influence on his playing, which would be understandable given the time they spent together. Scholars also attribute [[Blind Blake|Arthur \"Blind\" Blake]] as a major force in his development, with mannerisms and inflections that both share. It is also suggested by Alan Balfour and others that Moss may have been an influence on [[Blind Boy Fuller]], as they never met and Moss' recording career ended before Fuller's began&nbsp;\u2013 Moss's first recordings display some inflections and nuances that Fuller had not put down on record until some years later.\n\n==Biography==\nMoss was one of 12 children born to a sharecropper in the [[Warren County, Georgia|Warren County]] town of [[Jewell, Georgia]], midway between [[Atlanta]] and [[Augusta, Georgia|Augusta]]. There is some disagreement about his date of birth, some sources indicating 1906 and many others of more recent vintage claiming 1914. He began teaching himself the harmonica at a very early age, and he played at local parties around [[Augusta, Georgia|Augusta]], where the family moved when he was four and remained for the next 10 years. By 1928, he was busking around the streets of [[Atlanta]]. \"Nobody was my influence,\" he told Robert Springer of his harmonica playing, in a 1975 interview. \"I just kept hearing people, so I listen and I listen, and listen, and it finally come to me.\"\n\nBy the time he arrived in [[Atlanta]], he was good enough to be noticed by [[Curley Weaver]] and [[Barbecue Bob|Robert \"Barbecue Bob\" Hicks]], who began working with the younger Moss. It was [[Curley Weaver|Weaver]] and [[Barbecue Bob|Bob]] that got him onto his first recording date, at the age of 16, as a member of their group the [[Georgia Cotton Pickers (band)|Georgia Cotton Pickers]], on December 7, 1930 at the Campbell Hotel in [[Atlanta]], doing four songs for [[Columbia Records|Columbia]]: \"I'm on My Way Down Home,\" \"Diddle-Da-Diddle,\" \"She Looks So Good,\" and \"She's Comin' Back Some Cold Rainy Day.\" The group that day consisted of [[Barbecue Bob]] and [[Curley Weaver]] on guitars and Moss on harmonica. Moss would not record anything more for the next three years.\n\nBy 1933, Moss had taught himself the guitar, at which he became so proficient that he was a genuine peer and rival to Weaver. He frequently played with [[Barbecue Bob]] until his death of [[pneumonia]] on October 21, 1931, he found a new partner and associate in [[Atlanta]] blues legend [[Blind Willie McTell]], performing together at local parties in the [[Atlanta, Georgia|Atlanta area]].\n\nIn January 1933, however, he made his debut as a recording artist in his own right for the [[American Record Company]] in New York City, accompanied by [[Fred McMullen (musician)|Fred McMullen]] and [[Curley Weaver]], easily cutting three songs cut that first day, \"Bye Bye Mama,\" \"Daddy Don't Care,\" and \"Red River Blues.\" Another 8 songs followed over the next three days, and all 11 were released, far more than saw the light of day from [[Fred McMullen (musician)|McMullen]] or [[Curley Weaver|Weaver]] at those same sessions.\n\nThe debut sessions also featured Moss returning to the [[Harmonica|mouth harp]], as a member of the [[Georgia Browns]] \u2013 Moss, [[Curley Weaver|Weaver]], [[Fred McMullen (musician)|McMullen]] and singer [[Ruth Willis (musician)|Ruth Willis]] \u2013 for six songs done at the same sessions. But it was on the guitar that Moss would make his name over the next five years.\n\nMoss's records were released simultaneously on various budget labels associated with [[American Record Company|ARC]], and were so successful that in mid-September 1933, he was back in New York City along with [[Curley Weaver|Weaver]] and [[Blind Willie McTell]]. Moss cut another dozen songs for the company, this time accompanied by [[Curley Weaver]], while he accompanied [[Curley Weaver|Weaver]] and [[Blind Willie McTell|McTell]] on their numbers.\n\nThese songs sold well enough, that he was back in New York City in the summer of 1934, this time as a solo guitarist/singer, to do more than a dozen tracks. At this point, Moss's records were outselling those of his colleagues [[Curley Weaver|Weaver]] and [[Blind Willie McTell|McTell]], and were widely heard through the [[Southern United States|Southern]] and [[Border states (American Civil War)|Border]] states. His \"Oh Lordy Mama\" from these sessions became well known as \"[[Hey Lawdy Mama (blues song)|Hey Lawdy Mama]]\", a song interpreted by a variety of artists.<ref>\n{{cite web\n  | last = \n  | first = \n  | authorlink = \n  | coauthors = \n  | title = Hey Lawdy Mama\n  | work = \n  | publisher = allmusic\n  | date = \n  | url = http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=17:1887630\n  | format = \n  | doi = \n  | accessdate = September 8, 2010}} {{Dead link|date=January 2011|bot=CactusBot}}\n</ref> This body of recordings also best represents the bridge that Moss provided between [[Blind Blake]] and [[Blind Boy Fuller]] \u2013 his solo version of \"Some Lonesome Day,\" and also \"Dough Rollin' Papa,\" from 1934 advanced ideas in playing and singing that [[Blind Boy Fuller]] picked up and adapted to his own style, while one could listen to \"Insane Blues\" and pick up the lingering influence of [[Blind Blake]].\n\nBy August 1935, Moss saw his per-song fee doubled from $5 to $10 (in a period when many men were surviving on less than that per week), and when he wasn't recording, he was constantly playing around [[Atlanta]] alongside [[Blind Willie McTell|McTell]] and [[Curley Weaver|Weaver]]. When Moss returned to the studio in the summer of 1935, it was with a new partner, [[Josh White|Joshua Daniel White, \"The Singing Christian\"]]. The two recorded a group of 15 songs in August 1935, and it seemed like Moss was destined to outshine his one-time mentors [[Curley Weaver|Weaver]] and [[Blind Willie McTell|McTell]], when personal and legal disaster struck.\n\nIn an incident that has never been fully recounted or explained, Moss was arrested, [[Trial|tried]], and [[Conviction|convicted]] for the shooting murder of his wife and [[Sentence (law)|sentenced]] to a long prison term. (The above photograph was taken of Moss at the prison where he was incarcerated.) With the death of [[Blind Boy Fuller]] in 1941, his manager, J.B. Long, made efforts to secure Moss's release as a Fuller replacement, all to no avail until 1941, when a combination of Moss' own good behavior as a prisoner, the bribery of two parole boards, coupled with the entreaties of two outside sponsors (Long and Columbia Records) willing to assure his compliance with parole helped get him out of jail. J.B. Long finally effected his release to his custody with the understanding that Moss stay out of the State of Georgia for a decade. It was while working at [[Elon College]] for Long under the [[parole|parole agreement]] that he met a group of other [[blues]] [[musicians]] under Long's management that included [[Sonny Terry]] and [[Brownie McGhee]].\n\nIn October 1941, Moss, [[Sonny Terry|Terry]] and [[Brownie McGhee|McGhee]], a.o. went to New York City to cut a group of sides for [[Okeh|Okeh Records]]/[[Columbia Records|Columbia]], including 13 numbers by Moss featuring his two new colleagues. Only three of the songs were ever released, and then events conspired to cut short Moss's recording comeback. The entry of the United States into [[World War II]] in December of the same year forced the government to place a [[ration|wartime priority]] on the [[shellac]] used in the making of [[Gramophone record|78-rpm Gramophone records]] \u2013 there was barely enough allocated to the [[recording industry]] to keep functioning, and [[record companies]] were forced to curtail recordings by all but the most commercially viable artists; a ban on recording work by the [[American Federation of Musicians|Musicians' Union]] declared soon after further restricted any chance for Moss to record; and the interest in acoustic country blues, even of the caliber that he played, seemed to be waning, further cutting back on record company interest.\n\n''Moss'' continued performing in the area around [[Richmond, Virginia]] and [[Durham, North Carolina]] during the mid-'40s, and with [[Curley Weaver]] in [[Atlanta]] during the early 1950s, but music was no longer his profession or his living. His decade ban from Georgia is probably why he missed out on recording for Regal Records in Atlanta in 1949; the likes of [[Curley Weaver]], [[Blind Willie McTell]], and [[Frank Edwards (blues musician)|Frank Edwards]] were recorded then. He went to work on a tobacco farm, drove trucks, and worked as an [[elevator operator]], among other jobs, over the next 20-odd years.\n\nAlthough he still occasionally played in the area around [[Atlanta]], Moss was largely forgotten. Despite the fact that reference sources even then referred to him as one of the most influential bluesmen of the 1930s, he was overlooked by the blues revival. In a sense, he was cheated by the fact that his recording career had been so short \u2013 1933 to 1935 \u2013 and had never recovered from the interruption in his work caused by his stretch in prison. His difficult character made it difficult for many, Black and White, to deal with him.\n\nFate stepped in, in the form of some coincidences. In 1964, he chanced to hear that his old partner [[Josh White]] was giving a concert at [[Emory University]] in [[Atlanta]]. Moss visited [[Josh White|White]] backstage at the concert, and the fans hanging around established legend [[Josh White|White]] suddenly discovered a blues legend in their midst. Moss was persuaded to resume performing in a series of concerts before college audiences, most notably under the auspices of the [[Athens Folk Music and Dance Society|Atlanta Folk Music Society]] and the [[Folklore Society of Greater Washington]]. He also had new recording sessions for the [[Columbia Records|Columbia label]] in [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]], but none of the material was issued during his lifetime.\n\nA June 10, 1966 concert in Washington, D.C. was recorded and portions of it were later released on the [[Biograph Records|Biograph label]]. Moss played the [[Newport Folk Festival]] in 1969, and appeared at such unusual venues as [[Electric Circus (nightclub)|New York's Electric Circus]] during that same year. During the 1970s, he played the [[John Henry (folklore)|John Henry Memorial Concert]] in [[West Virginia]] for two consecutive years, and the [[Atlanta Blues Festival]] and the [[Atlanta Grass Roots Music Festival]] in 1976, and later at The National Folk Festival held at Wolf Trap Farm Park in Vienna, VA.\n\nMoss died in [[Atlanta]] on October 19, 1984, once again largely forgotten by the public. In the years since, his music was once again being heard courtesy of the [[Biograph Records|Biograph label's]] [[reissue]] of the 1966 performance and the [[Document Records|Austrian Document label]], which has released virtually every side that he released between 1930 and 1941. While there were some who tried to get him to record, his difficult personality made that impossible&nbsp;\u2013 once again, he was his own worst enemy&nbsp;\u2013 in spite of his immense talent and importance. As a result, his reputation has once again grown, although he is still not nearly as well known among blues enthusiasts as [[Blind Willie McTell]] or [[Blind Boy Fuller]].\n\n==Discography==\n===Album===\n*''Atlanta Blues Legend'' ([[Biograph Records|Biograph]], 1967) re-released in 1970 as ''Rediscovery''\n\n===Compilations===\n*''Georgia Blues Volume Two'' ([[Kokomo Records|Kokomo]], 1968)\n*''Georgia Blues 1930\u20131935'' ([[Travelin' Man Records|Travelin' Man]], 1983)\n*''Red River Blues: 1933\u20131941'' ([[Travelin' Man Records|Travelin' Man]], 1984)\n*''Buddy Moss 1933\u20131935'' ([[Document Records|Document]], 1988)\n*''Buddy Moss 1930\u20131941'' ([[Travelin' Man Records|Travelin' Man]], 1990)\n*''Complete Recorded Works Vol. 1; 1933'' ([[Document Records|Document]], 1992)\n*''Complete Recorded Works Vol. 2; 1933\u20131934'' ([[Document Records|Document]], 1992)\n*''Complete Recorded Works Vol. 3; 1935\u20131941'' ([[Document Records|Document]], 1992)\n*''Buddy Moss: The Essential'' ([[Document Records|Document]], 2002)\n\n==References==\n{{More footnotes|date=October 2008}}\n*[{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p470/biography|pure_url=yes}}  Bruce Eder, Allmusic]\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.wirz.de/music/moss.htm Illustrated Buddy Moss discography]\n\n{{Authority control|VIAF=85632399}}\n{{Persondata <!-- Metadata: see [[Wikipedia:Persondata]]. -->\n| NAME              =Moss, Buddy\n| ALTERNATIVE NAMES =\n| SHORT DESCRIPTION =American [[East Coast blues]] guitarist\n| DATE OF BIRTH     =January 16, 1914\n| PLACE OF BIRTH    =[[Jewell, Georgia]], United States\n| DATE OF DEATH     =October 19, 1984\n| PLACE OF DEATH    =[[Atlanta, Georgia]], United States\n}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Moss, Buddy}}\n[[Category:1914 births]]\n[[Category:1984 deaths]]\n[[Category:People from Warren County, Georgia]]\n[[Category:Columbia Records artists]]\n[[Category:American blues guitarists]]\n[[Category:Piedmont blues musicians]]\n[[Category:Songwriters from Georgia (U.S. state)]]"}]}}}}
