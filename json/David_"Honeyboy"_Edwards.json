He performed with famed blues musician [[Robert Johnson (musician)|Robert Johnson]] with whom he developed a close friendship. Honeyboy was present on the night Johnson drank poisoned [[whiskey]] which killed him,<ref>Guralnick, Peter. ''Searching for Robert Johnson'', 1989.</ref> and his story has become the definitive version of Johnson's demise. As well as Johnson, Edwards knew and played with many of the leading bluesmen in the Mississippi Delta, which included [[Charlie Patton|Charley Patton]], [[Tommy Johnson (blues musician)|Tommy Johnson]], and [[Johnny Shines]].\n\nHe described the itinerant bluesman's life:\n{{quote|On Saturday, somebody like me or Robert Johnson would go into one of these little towns, play for nickels and dimes. And sometimes, you know, you could be playin' and have such a big crowd that it would block the whole street. Then the police would come around, and then I'd go to another town and where I could play at. But most of the time, they would let you play. Then sometimes the man who owned a country store would give us something like a couple of dollars to play on a Saturday afternoon. We could [[hitchhike]], transfer from truck to truck, or if we couldn't catch one of them, we'd go to the train yard, 'cause the railroad was all through that part of the country then...we might hop a freight, go to [[St. Louis]] or [[Chicago]]. Or we might hear about where a job was paying off - a highway crew, a railroad job, a levee camp there along the river, or some place in the country where a lot of people were workin' on a farm. You could go there and play and everybody would hand you some money. I didn't have a special place then. Anywhere was home. Where I do good, I stay. When it gets bad and dull, I'm gone.<ref>Palmer, Robert.
