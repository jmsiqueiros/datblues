As a youth, his talent for [[poetry]] led him into songwriting and singing. He began his performing career in [[Texas]], and then moved to [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], [[California]] in 1942; success as a singer continued to elude him. In 1947, a small [[record label]], [[Swing Time Records|Swing Time]], signed him to [[sound recording and reproduction|record]] his song \"Two Years of Torture.\"  The song sold steadily over the next few years, prompting [[Art Rupe]] to sign Mayfield to his label, [[Specialty Records]] in 1950.<ref name=\"mayfield\">{{cite web\n|url=http://home.earthlink.net/~v1tiger/percy.html\n|title=Percy Mayfield\n|publisher=\n|accessdate=2006-11-06 \n}}</ref> \n\nAlthough his vocal style was influenced by such stylists as [[Charles Brown (musician)|Charles Brown]], Mayfield did not focus on the white market, unlike many West Coast bluesmen. Rather, he sang [[blues ballad]]s, mostly his own songs, in a gentle vocal style.  His most famous recording, \"[[Please Send Me Someone to Love]]\", a [[chart-topper|number one]] [[R&B]] [[hit single]] in 1950, was widely influential and recorded by many other singers.<ref name=\"gillett\">{{cite book\n| first=Charlie \n| last=Gillett  \n| year= 1996\n| title= The Rise of Rock and Roll\n| edition= (2nd Ed.)\n| publisher= Da Capo Press\n| location=New York, N.Y.\n| pages= 144\u2013146\n| isbn= 0-306-80683-5}}</ref>\n<div style=\"float:right; width:100px; border:2px; border-style:solid; padding:4px; margin-left: 1em; text-align:center\"><!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:swingtime mayfield two years of torture.jpg|100px|Two Years of Torture by Percy Mayfield]] --></div>\n\nA 1952 automobile accident left Mayfield seriously injured, including a facial disfigurement that limited his performing. However, that did not stop his prolific songwriting. Mayfield continued to write and record for Specialty until 1954, and then recorded for [[Chess Records]] and [[Imperial Records]]. His career continued to flourish with songs like \"Strange Things Happening\", \"Lost Love\", \"What a Fool I Was\", \"Prayin' for Your Return\"' \"Cry Baby\", and \"Big Question\".<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.history-of-rock.com/west_coast_artists.htm\n|title=Percy Mayfield\n|publisher=history-of-rock.com\n|accessdate=2006-11-06 \n}}</ref>  \n\nIn 1961, he came to the attention of [[Ray Charles]] with his song \"[[Hit the Road Jack]]\". Charles signed him to his [[Tangerine Records (1963)|Tangerine Records]] label, primarily as a songwriter; there he wrote \"Hide Nor Hair\", \"At The Club\", \"Danger Zone\", and \"On the Other Hand, Baby\".<ref name=\"mayfield\"/>\n\nThe period following the RCA recordings in the early 70's saw Percy Mayfield once again slip into obscurity and poverty; there was, however, one final chapter to his career. In the early 80's Bay Area blues musician [[Mark Naftalin]] discovered that Percy was living in the East Bay somewhere and was able to provide Percy with a band for live performances around several Marin County and East Bay clubs. The exposure also led to 1982 Timeless studio date with the excellent [[Phillip Walker]] Blues Band. \n==Death ==\nWhen Mayfield died of a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] in 1984, the day before his 64th birthday,<ref>[http://users.efortress.com/doc-rock/1980.html Dead Rock Stars Club website details]</ref> he had fallen back into obscurity.<ref>[http://arts.guardian.co.uk/print/0,,4822011-110430,00.html Guardian newspaper obituary]</ref>\n\n==Personal Life==\nPercy Mayfield married three times.
