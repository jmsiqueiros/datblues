He founded beat band The Moans in 1964, which would later become Long Tall Ernie and the Shakers. Brood was asked to play with [[Cuby and the Blizzards]], but was removed by management when the record company discovered he used drugs. For a number of years Brood was in jail (for dealing [[LSD]]), or abroad, and had a number of short-term engagements (with The Studs, the Flash & Dance Band, Vitesse).<ref name=\"biografie\"/>\n\nIn 1976, Brood started his own group, Herman Brood & his Wild Romance, (and started work with photographer [[Anton Corbijn]]){{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} initially with Ferdi Karmelk (guitar), Gerrit Veen (bass), Peter Walrecht (drums), and Ellen Piebes and Ria Ruiters (vocals). They played the club and bar circuit, first in [[Groningen (province)|Groningen]], In 1977 the band released their first album, ''[[Street (1977 album)|Street]]''.\n\nThe band now played all over the Netherlands, playing as many gigs as possible. And Herman's drug habit became public domain: In 1977 for instance the Wild Romance played a gig in a high school in Almelo, the Christelijk Lyceum; during the break Brood was caught on the toilet taking heroine or speed (there are different reports on the type of drug, but it is a well-known story amongst former students), the rest of the concert was cancelled, and this also was the last time a rock concert took place at this school for many years.{{cn|date=May 2013}}\n\n[[Image:Herman Brood Winterswijk.JPG|thumb|left|200px|Herman Brood in 1987]]\n[[Image:Broodgraffitdelft.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Graffiti in [[Delft]] in Brood's honor, done in his own style]]\n[[Image:Herman Brood 2 (Netherlands, Leidschendam).jpg|thumb|right|200px|Murals by Brood on a parking garage in Leidschendam.]]\n[[Image:Herman Brood 2000 Amsterdam Sander Lamme.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Herman Brood in 2000]]\n[[Image:Graf Herman Brood.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Brood's grave at ''Zorgvlied'']]\n\nThey are still best known for their second album, ''[[Shpritsz]]''\u2014a play on the German word for syringe\u2014from 1978. This album contained Brood anthems like \"Dope Sucks,\" \"Rock & Roll Junkie,\" and their first Dutch hit single, \"Saturday Night.\" The band went through many personnel changes over the years; the best-known formation was Freddy Cavalli (bass), Danny Lademacher (guitar) (later replaced with David Hollestelle), and Cees 'Ani' Meerman (drums).

At the end of the '80s he made a comeback of sorts; ''[[Yada Yada (album)|Yada Yada]]'' (1988), produced by [[George Kooymans]], was well-received, and he toured Germany with a renewed Wild Romance (which saw the return of Danny Lademacher).  In 1990, he won the BV Popprijs, one of the highest Dutch awards for popular music, and recorded ''Freeze'' with [[Clarence Clemons]] of the [[E Street Band]] and [[Tejano music|Tejano]] [[accordion]] player [[Flaco Jim\u00e9nez]].

At the third show in Arnhem they also dedicated their own [[Gone (U2 song)|\"Gone\"]] to him and had his version of [[My Way (song)|\"My Way\"]] played over the PA as outro music. In the middle of the show [[Bono]] delivered an emotional eulogy to Brood before the band performed \"[[In a Little While]]\".\n\nOn 5 November 2006 the [[Groninger Museum]] opened an exposition devoted to Herman Brood's life and work, comprising paintings, lyrics, and poetry, portraits by photographer [[Anton Corbijn]], a collection of private pictures (from the family album), and concert photos and videos. The exhibition was on show until 28 January. It was centered on Herman's atelier (studio) where he created most of his paintings. The atelier had been entirely re-built in the museum. During the 90s, Herman Brood's studio was located on the second floor of the gallery in the Spuistraat in Amsterdam and has remained untouched since his death.\n\nIn 2007 the film ''Wild Romance'' premiered in the Netherlands, a movie about Brood's life.
