He  had several hit recordings, including \"[[Driftin' Blues]]\" and \"[[Merry Christmas Baby]]\".<ref name=\"russell\"/>\n\n==History==\nIn the late 1940s, a rising demand for blues was driven by an increasing white teenage audience in the South which quickly spread north and west. Blues singers such as [[Louis Jordan]], [[Wynonie Harris]] and [[Roy Brown (blues musician)|Roy Brown]] were getting much of the attention, but what writer Charles Keil dubs \"the postwar Texas clean-up movement in blues\" was also beginning to have an influence, driven by Blues artists such as [[T-Bone Walker]], [[Amos Milburn]] and Charles Brown. Their singing was lighter, more relaxed and they worked with bands and combos that had saxophone sections and used arrangements.<ref name=\"keil\">{{cite book\n| first= Charles\n| last= Keil\n| year=1966, 1991\n| title= Urban Blues\n| edition=\n| publisher= University of Chicago Press\n| location=Chicago, IL\n| pages= 255 + ix + 8pp of plates\n| url = http://books.google.com/books?id=Yl-8ihykkQ8C&printsec=frontcover\n| isbn= 0-226-42960-1}}</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nBorn in [[Texas City, Texas]], Brown graduated from [[Galveston Independent School District|Central High School]] of [[Galveston, Texas]] in 1939 and [[Prairie View A&M University|Prairie View A&M College]] in 1942 with a degree in [[chemistry]]. He then became a chemistry teacher at [[Goose Creek Consolidated Independent School District|George Washington Carver High School]] of [[Baytown, Texas]], a [[mustard gas]] worker at the [[Pine Bluff Arsenal]] at [[Pine Bluff, Arkansas]], and an apprentice electrician at a shipyard in [[Richmond, California]] before settling in [[Los Angeles]] in 1943.<ref name=\"Texas handbook\"/>\n\n==Career==\nAs a child, Brown demonstrated his love of music and took classical piano lessons.  Early on, Brown moved out to [[Los Angeles]], where the great influx of blacks created an integrated nightclub scene in which black performers tended to minimize the rougher blues  elements of their style. The blues club style of a light rhythm bass and right-hand tinkling of the piano and smooth vocals became popular, epitomized by the jazz piano of [[Nat King Cole]]. When Cole left Los Angeles to perform nationally, his place was taken by [[Johnny Moore's Three Blazers]], featuring Charles Brown's gentle piano and vocals.<ref name=\"gillett\">{{cite book\n| first=Charlie\n| last=Gillett\n| year= 1996\n| title= The Rise of Rock and Roll\n| edition= (2nd Ed.)\n| publisher= Da Capo Press\n| location=New York, N.Y.\n| pages= 143\u2013147, 316\u2013317\n| isbn= 0-306-80683-5}}</ref>\n\nBrown signed with [[Aladdin Records (US)|Aladdin Records]] and his 1945 recording of, \"Driftin' Blues\", with a small combo on that [[record label]] went on the U.S. ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' R&B chart for six months, putting Brown at the forefront of a musical evolution that changed American musical performance.<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://home.earthlink.net/~jaymar41/CBrown.html\n|title=Charles Brown\n|publisher=\n|accessdate=2006-11-06\n}}</ref>  His style dominated the influential [[Southern California]] club scene on [[Central Avenue (Los Angeles)|Central Avenue]] during that period and he influenced such performers as [[Floyd Dixon]], [[Cecil Gant]], [[Ivory Joe Hunter]], [[Percy Mayfield]], [[Johnny Ace]] and [[Ray Charles]].<ref name=\"gillett\"/>\n\n\"Driftin' Blues\" was the first of several hits. Brown subsequently released \"Get Yourself Another Fool\", \"[[Black Night (Charles Brown song)|Black Night]]\", \"Hard Times\" and \"Trouble Blues\", all major hits in the early 1950s on such labels as [[Modern Records]] as well as Aladdin.<ref name=\"russell\"/> Though he was unable to compete with the burgeoning [[rock and roll]] sound that was increasing in popularity, he managed to maintain a small, devoted audience. Additionally, his songs were covered by the likes of [[John Lee Hooker]] and [[Lowell Fulson]].\n\nBrown's approach was too mellow to survive the transition to rock's harsher rhythms, and he faded from the national limelight. His \"[[Please Come Home for Christmas]]\", a hit in 1960 on the [[King Records (USA)|King Records]] remained seasonally popular.<ref name=\"russell\">{{cite book\n| first= Tony\n| last= Russell\n| year= 1997\n| title= The Blues - From Robert Johnson to Robert Cray\n| edition=\n| publisher=Carlton Books Limited\n| location= Dubai\n| pages= 70\u201371\n| isbn= 1-85868-255-X}}</ref> \"Please Come Home for Christmas\" sold over one million copies by 1968, and was awarded a [[music recording sales certification|gold disc]] in that year.<ref name=\"The Book of Golden Discs\">{{cite book\n| first= Joseph\n| last= Murrells\n| year= 1978\n| title= The Book of Golden Discs\n| edition= 2nd\n| publisher= Barrie and Jenkins Ltd\n| location= London\n| page= 83\n| isbn= 0-214-20512-6}}</ref> During the 1960s Brown recorded a couple of albums for Mainstream Records.\n\nIn the 1980s he made a series of appearances at [[New York City]] nightclub Tramps. As a result of these appearances he signed a new recording contract with Blue Side Records and recorded ''One More for the Road'' in three days. Blue Side Records closed soon after but distribution was picked up by Alligator Records. Soon after the success of ''One More for the Road'', [[Bonnie Raitt]] helped usher in a Charles Brown comeback tour.<ref name=\"history\">{{cite web\n|url=http://www.history-of-rock.com/west_coast_artists.htm\n|title=West coast artists - Charles Brown\n|publisher=\n|accessdate=2006-11-06\n}}</ref>\n\nHe began a recording and performing career again, under the musical direction of guitarist Danny Caron, to greater success than he had achieved since the 1950s. Other members of Charles' touring ensemble included Clifford Solomon on tenor saxophone, Ruth Davies on bass and [[Gaylord Birch]] on drums. \n<ref name=\"russell\"/> Several records received [[Grammy Award]] nominations.\n\nHe is a member of the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]],<ref>[http://www.rockhall.com/inductees/inductee-list/ Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Inductee List]</ref> and received both the [[National Endowment for the Arts]]' [[National Heritage Fellowship]]<ref>[http://www.nea.gov/honors/heritage/allheritage.html#97 Lifetime Honors: National Heritage Fellowships]</ref> and the [[Blues Music Award|W.
