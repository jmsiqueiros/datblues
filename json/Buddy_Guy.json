He is an exponent of the [[Chicago blues]] and has influenced white blues-rock musicians such as, [[Eric Clapton]], [[Jimmy Page]], and [[Stevie Ray Vaughan]]. In the 1960s Guy was a member of [[Muddy Waters]]' band and was a house guitarist at [[Chess Records]]. Guy had a long musical partnership with harmonica player [[Junior Wells]].\n\nGuy was ranked 30th in ''[[Rolling Stone (magazine)|Rolling Stone]]'' magazine's list of the \"[[Rolling Stone's 100 greatest guitarists of all time|100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time]]\",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/news/coverstory/5937559/page/20 |title=The 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time |work = [[Rolling Stone]] | date = 2004-03-24 |accessdate=2010-01-25 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080822023300/http://www.rollingstone.com/news/coverstory/5937559/page/20 |archivedate = 2008-08-22}}</ref> His song \"Stone Crazy\" was ranked 78th in ''Rolling Stone's'' list of the 100 Greatest Guitar Songs of All Time.<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20080531001214/www.rollingstone.com/news/coverstory/20947527/page/32 \"The 100 Greatest Guitar Songs of All Time\"].

ISBN 978-0-306-81957-5</ref>\n\n==Life and career==\nBorn and raised in [[Lettsworth, Louisiana]], Guy began learning guitar on a two-string [[diddley bow]] he made. Later he was given a [[Harmony Company|Harmony acoustic guitar]], which, decades later in Guy's lengthy career was donated to the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]]. In the early 1950s he began performing with bands in [[Baton Rouge]]. Soon after moving to [[Chicago]] in 1957, Guy fell under the influence of [[Muddy Waters]]. In 1958, a competition with West Side guitarists [[Magic Sam]] and [[Otis Rush]] gave Guy a record contract. Soon afterwards he recorded for [[Cobra Records]]. He recorded sessions with [[Junior Wells]] for [[Delmark Records]] under the pseudonym Friendly Chap in 1965 and 1966.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.riversidereader.com |title=We've Got The Westside Covered |publisher=Riverside Reader |date= |accessdate=2012-12-25}}</ref>\n\nGuy\u2019s early career was held back by both conservative business choices made by his record company ([[Chess Records]])  and \"the scorn, diminishments and petty subterfuge from a few jealous rivals\"{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}. Chess, Guy\u2019s record label from 1959 to 1968, refused to record Buddy Guy\u2019s novel style that was similar to his live shows. [[Leonard Chess]] (Chess founder and 1987 [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] inductee) denounced Guy\u2019s playing as \"noise\". In the early 1960s, Chess tried recording Guy as a solo artist with R&B ballads, jazz instrumentals, soul and novelty dance tunes, but none was released as a single. Guy\u2019s only Chess album, ''Left My Blues in San Francisco'', was finally issued in 1967. Most of the songs belong stylistically to the era's soul boom, with orchestrations by Gene Barge and Charlie Stepney. Chess used Guy mainly as a [[session musician|session guitarist]] to back [[Muddy Waters]], [[Howlin' Wolf]], [[Little Walter]], [[Sonny Boy Williamson II|Sonny Boy Williamson]], [[Koko Taylor]] and others.\n\nIn 1965 Guy participated in the European tour [[American Folk Blues Festival]].\n\nBuddy Guy appeared onstage at the March 1969 ''[[Supershow]]'' at [[Staines]], England, that also included [[Eric Clapton]], [[Led Zeppelin]], [[Jack Bruce]], [[Stephen Stills]], [[Buddy Miles]],  [[Glenn Ross Campbell|Glenn Campbell]], [[Roland Kirk]], [[Jon Hiseman]], and [[The Misunderstood]]. But by the late 1960s, Guy's star was in decline.\n\nGuy's career finally took off during the blues revival period of the late 1980s and early 1990s. It was sparked by Clapton's request that Guy be part of the '24 Nights' all-star blues guitar lineup at [[London]]'s [[Royal Albert Hall]] and Guy's subsequent signing with [[Silvertone Records (1980)|Silvertone Records]].\n\nGuy performs an annual residency at his own [[Buddy Guy's Legends]], a Chicago blues club, each January.<ref>\n{{cite web\n  |url=http://www.metropulse.com/news/2013/feb/27/buddy-guy-keeps-blues-alive/\n  |title=Buddy Guy Keeps the Blues Alive\n  |work=MetroPulse\n  |date=27 February 2013\n  |accessdate=26 March 2013\n  |first=Matthew|last=Everett\n  |publisher=Scripps Interactive Newspapers Group\n}}</ref>\n\n==Music==\n[[File:Buddy Guy.jpg|thumb|220px|right|Buddy Guy in 1993 performing in Toronto, Canada]]\nWhile Buddy Guy's music is often labeled [[Chicago blues]], his style is unique and separate. His music can vary from the most traditional, deepest blues to a creative, unpredictable and radical gumbo of the blues, avant rock, soul and free jazz that morphs at each night\u2019s performance.\n\nAs ''New York Times'' music critic [[Jon Pareles]] noted in 2004:\n\n<blockquote>\nMr. Guy, 68, mingles anarchy, virtuosity, deep blues and hammy shtick in ways that keep all eyes on him.... [Guy] loves extremes: sudden drops from loud to soft, or a sweet, sustained guitar solo followed by a jolt of speed, or a high, imploring vocal cut off with a rasp.... Whether he's singing with gentle menace or bending new curves into a blue note, he is a master of tension and release, and his every wayward impulse was riveting.\n</blockquote>\n\nIn an interview taped April 14, 2000, for the Cleveland college station, WRUW-FM, Guy said: \"The purpose of me trying to play the kind of rocky stuff is to get airplay...I find myself kind of searching, hoping I'll hit the right notes, say the right things, maybe they'll put me on one of these big stations, what they call 'classic'...if you get Eric Clapton to play a Muddy Waters song, they call it classic, and they will put it on that station, but you'll never hear Muddy Waters.\"\n\n==Influence==\nFor almost 50 years, Guy has performed flamboyant live concerts of energetic blues and blues rock, predating the 1960s blues rockers. As a musician, he had a fundamental impact on the blues and on rock and roll, influencing a new generation of artists.\n\nBuddy Guy has been called the bridge between the blues and rock and roll. He is one of the historic links between Chicago electric blues pioneers Muddy Waters and [[Howlin' Wolf]] and popular musicians like [[Eric Clapton]], [[Jeff Beck]], [[Jimi Hendrix]] and [[Jimmy Page]] as well as later revivalists like [[Stevie Ray Vaughan]]. Vaughan stated that, \"Without Buddy Guy, there would be no Stevie Ray Vaughan.\" ''[[Guitarist (magazine)|Guitarist]]'' magazine observed:\n:Without Buddy Guy, the blues, not to mention rock as we know it, might be a heckuva lot less interesting today. Take the blues out of contemporary rock music\u2014or pop, jazz and funk for that matter\u2014and what you have left is a wholly spineless affair. A tasteless stew. Makes you shudder to think about it...{{Where|date=July 2011}}[[File:Buddy Guy Liri Blues 1989.jpg|140px|right|thumb|Buddy Guy at the [[Liri Blues Festival]], Italy, in 1989]]\n\nIn addition, Guy's pathfinding guitar techniques also contributed greatly to rock and roll music. His guitar playing was loud and aggressive; used pioneering distortion and [[audio feedback|feedback]] techniques; employed longer solos; had shifts of volume and texture; and was driven by emotion and impulse. These lessons were eagerly learned and applied by the new wave of 1960s British artists and later became basic attributes of blues-rock music and its offspring, hard rock and heavy metal music. Jeff Beck realized in the early 1960s: \"I didn't know a [[Fender Stratocaster|Strat]] could sound like that \u2014 until I heard Buddy's tracks on the ''Blues From Big Bill's Copa Cabana'' album\" (reissue of ''1963 Folk Festival Of The Blues'' album) and \"It was the total manic abandon in Buddy's solos. They broke all boundaries. I just thought, this is more like it! Also, his solos weren't restricted to a three-minute pop format; they were long and really developed.\"{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}\n\nClapton has stated that he got the idea for a [[blues-rock]] power trio while watching Buddy Guy's trio perform in England in 1965. Clapton later formed the rock band Cream, which was \"the first rock [[Supergroup (music)|supergroup]] to become superstars\" and was also \"the first top group to truly exploit the power-trio format, in the process laying the foundation for much blues-rock and hard rock of the 1960s and 1970s.\"{{Where|date=July 2011}}\n\nEric Clapton said \"Buddy Guy was to me what [[Elvis Presley|Elvis]] was for others.\" Clapton said in a 1985 ''[[Musician (magazine)|Musician]]'' magazine article that \"Buddy Guy is by far and without a doubt the best guitar player alive...if you see him in person, the way he plays is beyond anyone. Total freedom of spirit, I guess. He really changed the course of rock and roll blues.\"\n\n[[File:Buddy Guy 1998.jpg|220px|left|thumb|Buddy Guy performing in 1999]]\nRecalls Guy: \"Eric Clapton and I are the best of friends and I like the tune \"[[Strange Brew (song)|Strange Brew]]\" and we were sitting and having a drink one day and I said 'Man, that \"Strange Brew\"...you just cracked me up with that note.' And he said 'You should...cause it's your licks...' \" As soon as Clapton completed his famous [[Derek & the Dominos]] sessions in October 1970, he co-produced (with [[Ahmet Erteg\u00fcn]] and [[Tom Dowd]]) the ''Buddy Guy & Junior Wells Play The Blues'' album with Guy's longtime harp and vocal compatriot, Junior Wells. The record, released in 1972, is regarded by some critics as among the finest electric blues recordings of the modern era.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}\n\nIn recognition of Guy's influence on Hendrix's career, the Hendrix family invited Buddy Guy to headline all-star casts at several Jimi Hendrix tribute concerts they organized in recent years, \"calling on a legend to celebrate a legend.\"  Jimi Hendrix himself once said that \"Heaven is lying at Buddy Guy\u2019s feet while listening to him play guitar.\"{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}\n\nSongs such as \"[[Red House (song)|Red House]]\", \"[[Voodoo Chile]]\" and \"[[Voodoo Child (Slight Return)]]\" partly came from the sonic world that Buddy Guy helped to create. According to the Fender Players' Club: \"Almost ten years before Jimi Hendrix would electrify the rock world with his high-voltage voodoo blues, Buddy Guy was shocking juke joint patrons in [[Baton Rouge]] with his own brand of high-octane blues. Ironically, when Buddy\u2019s playing technique and flamboyant showmanship were later revealed to crossover audiences in the late Sixties, it was erroneously assumed that he was imitating Hendrix.\" (In 1993, Guy covered \"Red House\" on ''[[Stone Free: A Tribute to Jimi Hendrix]]''.)\n\n[[File:BuddyGuyBonnaroo2006.jpg|200px|right|thumb|Guy performing at the [[Bonnaroo Music Festival]] in 2006.]]\n[[File:Buddy Guy 1983.jpg|right|thumb|In Urbana, IL, 1983]]\nStevie Ray Vaughan once declared that Buddy Guy \"plays from a place that I've never heard anyone play.\" Vaughan continued:\n:Buddy can go from one end of the spectrum to another. He can play quieter than anybody I've ever heard, or wilder and louder than anybody I've ever heard. I play pretty loud a lot of times, but Buddy's tones are incredible. He pulls such emotion out of so little volume. Buddy just has this cool feel to everything he does. And when he sings, it's just compounded. Girls fall over and sweat and die! Every once in a while I get the chance to play with Buddy, and he gets me every time, because we could try to go to Mars on guitars but then he'll start singing, sing a couple of lines, and then stick the mike in front of me! What are you gonna do? What is a person gonna do?!\n\nJeff Beck affirmed:\n:Geez, you can't forget Buddy Guy. He transcended blues and started becoming theater. It was high art, kind of like drama theater when he played, you know. He was playing behind his head long before Hendrix. I once saw him throw the guitar up in the air and catch it in the same chord.\nBeck recalled the night he and Stevie Ray Vaughan jammed with Guy at Buddy Guy\u2019s Legends club<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.buddyguys.com/ |title=Buddy Guy's Legends |publisher=Buddyguys.com |date=2011-11-26 |accessdate=2011-12-30}}</ref> in Chicago: \"That was just the most incredible stuff I ever heard in my life. The three of us all jammed and it was so thrilling. That is as close you can come to the heart of the blues.\" \nAccording to Jimmy Page:\n\"Buddy Guy is an absolute monster\" and \"There were a number of albums that everybody got tuned into in the early days. There was one in particular called, I think, American Folk Festival Of The Blues, which featured Buddy Guy. He just astounded everybody.\"\n\nSinger-songwriter and guitarist [[John Mayer]], who has performed with Guy on numerous occasions (including with Clapton's [[Crossroads Guitar Festival]] and on PBS's ''[[Soundstage (TV series)|Soundstage]]'') and collaborated with him on Guy's 2005 album ''Bring 'Em In'', cited on several occasions that Buddy Guy was one of his top influences.\n\nFormer [[Rolling Stones]] bassist [[Bill Wyman]]:\n\"Guitar Legends do not come any better than Buddy Guy. He is feted by his peers and loved by his fans for his ability to make the guitar both talk and cry the blues. Such is Buddy's mastery of the guitar that there is virtually no guitarist that he cannot imitate.\"\n\nGuy has opened for the Rolling Stones on numerous tours since the early 1970s. [[Slash (musician)|Slash]]: \"Buddy Guy is the perfect combination of R&B and hardcore rock and roll.\" [[ZZ Top]]\u2019s [[Billy Gibbons]]: \"He (Buddy Guy) ain't no trickster. He may appear surprised by his own instant ability but, clearly, he knows what's up.\"\n\nGuy was a judge for the 6th and 8th annual [[The Independent Music Awards|Independent Music Awards]] to support independent artists.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.independentmusicawards.com/ima_new/pastjudges.asp |title=Independent Music Awards |publisher=Independent Music Awards |date= |accessdate=2012-12-25}}</ref>\n\nGuy appeared and performed in an episode of the popular children's show, ''[[Jack's Big Music Show]]'', as the \"King of Swing\".
