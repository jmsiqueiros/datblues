He was adopted as an infant;<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.canada.com/ottawacitizen/news/story.html?id=3dca3ea3-135f-4c48-9ac9-1a728448f100|title= Award-winning musician 'followed his own passion'|accessdate= 2008-03-08|author= Jessey Bird|date= 2008-03-03|publisher= [[Ottawa Citizen]]}}</ref> his adoptive father was a [[firefighter]]. When he was almost one year old, Healey lost his sight to [[retinoblastoma]], a rare [[cancer]] of the eyes. His eyes had to be surgically removed, and he was given [[Ocular prosthesis|ocular prostheses]].\n\n==Early career and success==\n\nHealey began playing guitar when he was three, developing his unique style of playing the instrument flat on his lap. When he was 15,<ref>{{cite book|author=Assayas, Michka (ed.)|title = Le dictionnaire du rock|year= 2000|publisher= Robert laffont, collection Bouquins|page=775}}</ref> Jeff Healey formed the band Blue Direction, a four-piece which primarily played bar-band cover tunes and featured [[bassist]] Jeremy Littler, drummer Graydon Chapman, and a schoolmate, [[Rob Quail]] on second guitar. This band played various local clubs in Toronto, including the [[Colonial Tavern]].\n\nHealey began hosting a jazz and blues show on [[radio]] station [[CIUT-FM]] where he became known for playing from his massive collection of vintage 78 rpm [[phonograph|gramophone]] records.<ref>{{cite news | url= http://www.cbc.ca/radio2/blog/2008/03/03/jeff_healey_1.html | title=Jeff Healey | publisher=www.cbc.ca | accessdate=23 May 2011}}</ref>\n\nShortly thereafter he was introduced to two musicians, bassist [[Joe Rockman]] and [[drum kit|drummer]] [[Tom Stephen]], with whom he formed a trio, The Jeff Healey Band. This band made their first public appearance at the [[Birds Nest]], located upstairs at [[Chicago's Diner]] on [[Queen Street West]] in [[Toronto]]. They received a write-up in Toronto's ''[[NOW (magazine)|NOW]]'' magazine, and soon were playing almost nightly in local clubs, such as [[Grossman's Tavern]] and the famed blues club [[Albert's Hall]] (where Jeff Healey was discovered by guitarists [[Stevie Ray Vaughan]] and [[Albert Collins]]).\n\nAfter being signed to [[Arista Records]] in 1988, the band released the album ''[[See the Light (Jeff Healey album)|See the Light]]'', featuring the hit single \"[[Angel Eyes (The Jeff Healey Band song)|Angel Eyes]]\" and the song \"Hideaway\", which was nominated for a [[Grammy Award]] for Best Rock Instrumental Performance. While the band was recording ''See the Light'', they were also filming (and recording for the soundtrack of) the [[Patrick Swayze]] film [[Road House (1989 film)|''Road House'']].<ref>{{cite web | url= http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0098206/ | title=Road House (1989) | publisher=www.imdb.com | accessdate=23 May 2011}}</ref> Healey had numerous acting scenes in the movie with Swayze, as his band was the house cover band for the bar featured in the movie. In 1990, the band won the [[Juno Award]] for [[Juno Award for Entertainer of the Year|Canadian Entertainer of the Year]]. The albums ''[[Hell to Pay (Jeff Healey album)|Hell to Pay]]'' and ''[[Feel This (album)|Feel This]]'' gave Healey 10 charting singles in Canada between 1990 and 1994, including a [[cover version|cover]] of [[The Beatles]]' ''[[While My Guitar Gently Weeps]]'' which featured [[George Harrison]] and [[Jeff Lynne]] on backing vocals and acoustic guitar.<ref>Arista Records LP AL-8632, 1990.</ref>\n\n==Later work and life==\nBy the release of the 2000 album ''[[Get Me Some (album)|Get Me Some]],'' Healey began to concentrate his talent in a different musical direction closer to his heart, the appreciation for another original American music form, [[jazz]].\n\nHe went on to release three CDs of music of traditional American jazz from the 1920s and 1930s. He had been sitting in with these types of bands around Toronto since the beginning of his music career. Though known primarily as a guitarist, Healey also played [[trumpet]] during live performances.  His main jazz group for touring and recording being [[Jeff Healey's Jazz Wizards]].  \n\nHealey was an avid [[record collecting|record collector]] and amassed a collection of well over 30,000 [[78 rpm]] records. He had, from time to time, hosted a [[CBC Radio]] program entitled ''My Kind of Jazz'', in which he played records from his vast vintage jazz collection. He hosted a program with a similar name on Toronto jazz station [[CJRT-FM]]; as of 2010, the latter program continued to air in repeats.\n\nFor many years, Healey toured throughout North America and Europe and performed at his club, \"Healey's\" on [[Bathurst Street, Toronto|Bathurst Street]] in Toronto, where he played with his blues band on Thursday nights and also with his jazz group on Saturday afternoons. The club moved to a bigger location at 56 Blue Jays Way and was rechristened \"Jeff Healey's Roadhouse.\" Though he had lent his name to the club and often played there, Jeff Healey did not own or manage the bar. (The name came from the 1989 film, ''[[Road House (1989 film)|Road House]],'' in which Healey appeared.)\n\nAt the time of his death, he had been planning to perform a series of shows in the [[United Kingdom]], [[Germany]], and the [[Netherlands]] with his other band, the '[[Jeff Healey Blues Band]]' (aka the 'Healey's House Band') in April 2008.\n\nOver the years, Healey toured and sat in with many legendary performers, including [[The Allman Brothers]], [[Bonnie Raitt]], [[Stevie Ray Vaughan]], [[Buddy Guy]], [[BB King]], [[ZZ Top]], [[Steve Lukather]], [[Eric Clapton]] and many more. In 2006, Healey appeared on [[Deep Purple]] vocalist [[Ian Gillan]]'s [[Compact disc|CD]]/[[DVD]] ''[[Gillan's Inn (album)|Gillan's Inn]].'' \n\nHealey discovered and helped develop the careers of other musical artists, including [[Terra Hazelton]] and [[Amanda Marshall]].<ref>[http://pages.infinit.net/sonicboy/amanda/ The Ultimate Amanda Marshall Homepage].
