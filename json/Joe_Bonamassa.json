Comparing the music in the United States to the \"European\" versions of the blues, Bonamassa found the English blues - fostered by the [[Jeff Beck Group]], Eric Clapton and the Irish blues player [[Rory Gallagher]] - to be far more interesting to him than the original [[Delta blues]] players. In an interview in ''[[Guitarist (magazine)|Guitarist]]'' magazine (issue 265), he cited the three albums that had the biggest influence on his playing: [[John Mayall & the Bluesbreakers]] with Eric Clapton (the [[Beano album]]), Rory Gallagher's ''[[Irish Tour]]'' and ''[[Goodbye (Cream album)|Goodbye]]'' by [[Cream (band)|Cream]]. He also stated [[Stevie Ray Vaughan]]'s ''[[Texas Flood]]'' was a big influence at a young age. He also listed the early blues playing of [[Jethro Tull (band)|Jethro Tull]] as one of his influences, putting both [[Martin Barre]] and [[Mick Abrahams]] as important musicians to him.<ref>http://www.bluesinbritain.org/joe-bonamassa-interview/</ref><ref>http://guitarinternational.com/2010/12/28/joe-bonamassa-talks-influences-touring-and-gear/</ref> His first solo album was named after and includes a cover version of [[Jethro Tull]]'s \"A New Day Yesterday\" from their album ''[[Stand Up (Jethro Tull album)|Stand Up]]''.\n[[File:JoeBonamassaStaffordTX.jpg|thumb|220px|right|Bonamassa performing in Stafford, Texas, 2007]]\nHe elaborated further on his influences in the interview:\n\n{{blockquote|\"You know, my heroes were the columbine guys \u2013 [[Paul Kossoff]], [[Peter Green (musician)|Peter Green]], Eric Clapton. There\u2019s so many \u2013 there\u2019s [[Gary Moore]], Rory Gallagher \u2013 another [[Irish people|Irish]] musician who played the same things, but don\u2019t tell him that. But those guys were my guys \u2013 [[Jeff Beck]], [[Jimmy Page]]. There\u2019s a certain sophistication to their approach to the blues that I really like, more so than the American blues that I was listening to. B. B. King\u2019s a big influence \u2013 he\u2019s probably my biggest traditional influence. I love Muddy Waters, Robert Johnson and [[T-Bone Walker]] and stuff like that, but I couldn\u2019t sit down\u2026 I was always forcing myself to listen to whole records by them, where I\u2019d rather listen to [[Humble Pie (band)|Humble Pie]] do \"I'm Ready\" than Muddy Waters, you know?  I think, the English interpretation of the blues just hit me a lot better, you know?\"}}\n\nAnd in his October 2008 interview with ''[[Express & Star]]'':\n\n{{blockquote|\u201cWhen I heard [[Paul Kossoff|Kossoff]] playing \"Mr. Big\" and when I heard Clapton playing \"[[Cross Road Blues|Crossroads]]\" and when I heard Rory Gallagher playing \"[[Cradle Rock]]\", I was like, 'This is way cooler'.... \"British blues are my thing. When I heard [[Rod Stewart]] and the [[Jeff Beck Group]] singing \"Let Me Love You\", it changed my life. I knew exactly what I wanted to do. Those are my influences\".}}\n\nJoe Bonamassa had appeared in Eric Clapton's Crossroads Guitar Festival 2010 alongside Robert Randolph, Pino Daniele.\n\n==Discography==\n{{Main|Joe Bonamassa discography}}\n;Solo studio albums\n*''[[A New Day Yesterday (Joe Bonamassa album)|A New Day Yesterday]]'' (2000)\n*''[[So, It's Like That]]'' (2002)\n*''[[Blues Deluxe]]'' (2003)\n*''[[Had to Cry Today (album)|Had to Cry Today]]'' (2004)\n*''[[You & Me (Joe Bonamassa album)|You & Me]]'' (2006)\n*''[[Sloe Gin (album)|Sloe Gin]]'' (2007)\n*''[[The Ballad of John Henry (album)|The Ballad of John Henry]]'' (2009)\n*''[[Black Rock (Joe Bonamassa Album)|Black Rock]]'' (2010)\n*''[[Dust Bowl (album)|Dust Bowl]]'' (2011)\n*''[[Driving Towards the Daylight]]'' (2012)\n\n;Live Albums\n*''[[A New Day Yesterday Live]]'' (2002)\n*''[[Shepherds Bush Empire (album)|Shepherds Bush Empire]]'' (2007)\n*''[[Live from Nowhere in Particular]]'' (2008)\n*''[[Live from the Royal Albert Hall (Joe Bonamassa album)|Live from the Royal Albert Hall]]'' (2009)\n*''Beacon Theatre: Live from New York'' (2012)\n*''An Acoustic Evening at The Vienna Opera House'' (2013)\n*''Live In Amsterdam'' (together with [[Beth Hart]]) (2014)\n*''Tour De Force - Live from the Borderline'' (2014)\n*''Tour De Force - Live from the Shepherd\u2019s Bush Empire'' (2014)\n*''Tour De Force - Live from the Hammersmith Apollo'' (2014)\n*''Tour De Force - Live from the Royal Albert Hall'' (2014)\n\n;Video Albums\n*''[[A New Day Yesterday Live]]'' (2002)\n*''[[Live at Rockpalast]]'' (2005)\n*''[[Live from the Royal Albert Hall (Joe Bonamassa album)|Live from the Royal Albert Hall]]'' (2009)\n*''Beacon Theatre: Live from New York'' (2012)\n*''An Acoustic Evening at The Vienna Opera House'' (2013)\n*''Tour de Force: Live in London'' (4-DVD series) (2013)\n*''Live In Amsterdam'' (together with [[Beth Hart]]) (2014)\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Joe Bonamassa}}\n*{{Official website|http://www.jbonamassa.com/}}\n<!--======================== {{No more links}} ============================\n    | PLEASE BE CAUTIOUS IN ADDING MORE LINKS TO THIS ARTICLE.
