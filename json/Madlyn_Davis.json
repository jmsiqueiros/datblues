She was active as a recording artist in the late 1920s, and her best known tracks were \"Kokola Blues\" and \"It's Red Hot\". Although Davis was a contemporary of better known recording artists of the time, such as [[Ma Rainey]], [[Bessie Smith]], [[Clara Smith]], [[Mozelle Alderson]], [[Victoria Spivey]], [[Sippie Wallace]], and [[Bertha \"Chippie\" Hill]], little is known of the life outside of her music.<ref name=\"AMG\"/>\n\n==Career==\nDavis made ten recordings in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]] for [[Paramount Records]], with her first session taking place in June 1927. With accompaniment from the Red Hot Shakers, who likely included [[Cassino Simpson]] on piano, Davis recorded \"Worried Down with the Blues\" and \"Climbing Mountain Blues.\" \"Hurry Sundown Blues\"<ref>{{cite book\n| first= Barry Lee\n| last= Pearson\n| year= 2005\n| title= Jook right on: blues stories and blues storytellers\n| edition= 1st\n| publisher= The University of Tennessee Press \n| location= Knoxville, Tennessee\n| isbn= 1-57233-432-0\n| page= 215}}</ref> and \"Landlady's Footsteps,\" were the next in September that year, followed by another two efforts in November.  Her backing [[musical ensemble|trio]] now incorporated [[Richard M. Jones]], and \"Kokola Blues\" laid part of the foundations for the more famous song, \"[[Sweet Home Chicago]].\" On \"Kokola Blues\", the [[refrain]] stated: <blockquote>''And it's hey, hey baby, baby don't you want to go''<br />\n''Back to that eleven light city, back to sweet Kokomo'' (sic)<ref>\"Kokola Blues\", Madlyn Davis, Paramount PM 12615</ref></blockquote> The other track laid down at the same session was \"Winter Blues\", noteworthy for Davis' worded extortation to her musicians to \"swing\", as they duly upped the tempo of the song.\n\nIn October 1928, Davis had her final recording stint, with her backing musicians including [[Thomas A. Dorsey|Georgia Tom Dorsey]] on piano and [[Tampa Red]] on guitar. The four songs they recorded were \"Gold Tooth Mama Blues,\" \"Death Bell Blues,\" \"Too Black Bad,\"<ref>{{cite book\n| first= Paul\n| last= Oliver\n| year= 1989\n| title= Screening the blues: aspects of the blues tradition\n| edition= 1st\n| publisher= De Capo Press \n| location= Cambridge, Massachusetts\n| isbn= 0-306-80344-5\n| page= 59}}</ref> and \"It's Red Hot.\"<ref name=\"AMG\"/> On the latter she was billed as Red Hot Shakin' Davis. However, her propensity to up the pace on recordings did not continue, and Davis potentially missed out on the subsequent musical  developments of [[swing music|swing]] and [[rhythm and blues]], which may have better suited her style.<ref name=\"AMG\">{{cite web |first= |last= |url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p69144/biography|pure_url=yes}} |title=Biography by arwulf arwulf |publisher=Allmusic.com |accessdate=October 2, 2011}}</ref> \n\nTwo alternate versions of \"Worried Down with the Blues\", plus her \"Hurry Sundown Blues,\" \"Climbing Mountain Blues,\" \"Landlady's Footsteps,\" \"Winter Blues,\" and \"Kokola Blues,\" were included on the [[compilation album]], ''Female Blues Singers, Vol. 5: C/D/E (1921-1928)'', released in 1997 by [[Document Records|Document]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Scott Yanow |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/female-blues-singers-vol-5-c-d-e-1921-1928-mw0000055726 |title=Female Blues Singers, Vol. 5: C/D/E (1921-1928) - Various Artists &#124; Songs, Reviews, Credits, Awards |publisher=AllMusic |date= |accessdate=2014-01-27}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of classic female blues singers]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.wirz.de/music/jamesfrm.htm Madlyn Davis on the Skip James discography - Wirz.de]\n\n{{Persondata <!-- Metadata: see [[Wikipedia:Persondata]]. -->\n| NAME              = Davis, Madlyn\n| ALTERNATIVE NAMES =\n| SHORT DESCRIPTION = [[United States|American]] [[classic female blues]] singer\n| DATE OF BIRTH     = Unknown\n| PLACE OF BIRTH    = \n| DATE OF DEATH     = Unknown\n| PLACE OF DEATH    =\n}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Davis, Madlyn}}\n[[Category:Year of birth missing]]\n[[Category:Place of birth missing]]\n[[Category:Year of death missing]]\n[[Category:Place of death missing]]\n[[Category:African-American female singers]]\n[[Category:American blues singers]]\n[[Category:Classic female blues singers]]"}]}}}}
