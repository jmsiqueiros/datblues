Temple was born in [[Lexington, North Carolina]]. He batted and threw right-handed.\n\nTemple was a career .284 hitter with 22 [[home run]]s and 395 [[Run batted in|RBI]] in 1420 games. A legitimate leadoff hitter and four-time [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star]], he was a very popular player in Cincinnati in the 1950s. Throughout his career, he [[Base on balls|walked]] more often than he [[Strikeout|struck out]], compiling an outstanding 1.92 [[walk-to-strikeout ratio]] (648-to-338) and a .363 [[on-base percentage]]. Temple also had above-average speed and good instincts on the base paths. Quietly, he had 140 [[Stolen base|steals]] in 198 attempts (71%). Defensively, he showed great range with a strong and accurate arm.\n\nTemple enjoyed his best year in [[1959 in sports|1959]], with career-highs in batting average (.311), home runs (8), RBI (67), [[Run (baseball statistics)|runs]] (102), [[Hit (baseball statistics)|hits]] (186),  [[At bat|at-bats]] (598), [[Double (baseball)|doubles]] (35) and [[Triple (baseball)|triples]] (6).  At the end of the season he was sent to Cleveland for [[Billy Martin]], [[Gordy Coleman]] and [[Cal McLish]], in one of the first interleague trades in major league history (December 16, 1959). Temple also played with Baltimore and Houston, and again with Cincinnati for his last major season, where he was a part-time [[coach (baseball)|coach]]. However he reported to spring training out of shape and only had three plate appearances.  In August, he fought with fellow coach Reggie Otero and was released.  He did not fare well after baseball where bad investments rendered him nearly broke.  Temple died in [[Anderson, South Carolina]] in 1994 at the age of 66.\n\n==All-Star==\nIn {{By|1957}}, Temple and six of his Redleg teammates\u2014[[Ed Bailey]], [[Roy McMillan]], [[Don Hoak]], [[Gus Bell]], [[Wally Post]] and [[Frank Robinson]]\u2014were voted into the [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|National League All-Star]] starting lineup, the result of a [[ballot stuffing]] campaign by Redlegs fans. Bell remained on the team as a reserve, but Post was taken off altogether. Bell and Post were replaced as starters by [[Hank Aaron]] and [[Willie Mays]].\n\n==Highlights==\n* 4-time All-Star (1956,57,59,61)\n* Hit .300-plus three seasons (1954,58,59)\n* Tied for the NL lead in walks (94; 1957)\n* Led NL second basemen in [[putout]]s 3 times (1954,55,58)\n* Led NL second baseman  in [[assist (baseball)|assist]]s (1956)\n* Led NL second basemen in [[double play]]s (1955)\n* Member of Cincinnati Reds Hall of Fame (inducted in 1965)\n\n==External links==\n{{Baseballstats | br=t/templjo01 | fangraphs=1012910 | cube=Johnny-Temple}}\n*Johnny Temple at:\n**[http://www.baseball-almanac.com/players/player.php?p=templjo01 Baseball Almanac (miscellaneous)]\n**[http://www.baseballlibrary.com/baseballlibrary/ballplayers/T/Temple_Johnny.stm Baseball Library (profile)]\n**[http://janesbit.tripod.com/mlb/reds/redstemple.html Cincinnati Reds All Time Team]\n\n\n{{Persondata <!-- Metadata: see [[Wikipedia:Persondata]]. -->\n| NAME              =Temple, Johnny\n| ALTERNATIVE NAMES =\n| SHORT DESCRIPTION = American baseball player and coach\n| DATE OF BIRTH     =August 8, 1927\n| PLACE OF BIRTH    =Lexington, North Carolina\n| DATE OF DEATH     =January 9, 1994\n| PLACE OF DEATH    =Anderson, South Carolina\n}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Temple, Johnny}}\n[[Category:1927 births]]\n[[Category:1994 deaths]]\n[[Category:American League All-Stars]]\n[[Category:Baltimore Orioles players]]\n[[Category:Baseball players from North Carolina]]\n[[Category:Cancer deaths in South Carolina]]\n[[Category:Caribbean Series players]] \n[[Category:Cincinnati Reds coaches]]\n[[Category:Cincinnati Reds players]]\n[[Category:Cincinnati Redlegs players]]\n[[Category:Cleveland Indians players]]\n[[Category:Deaths from pancreatic cancer]]\n[[Category:Houston Colt .45s players]]\n[[Category:Major League Baseball announcers]]\n[[Category:Major League Baseball second basemen]] \n\n\n[[Category:National League All-Stars]]"}]}}}}
