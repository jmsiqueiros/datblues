His popularity and proficiency secured him a residency at Memphis's prestigious [[Peabody Hotel]] in 1919.  Like [[Lead Belly]], Jackson knew hundreds of songs including blues, ballads, vaudeville numbers, and traditional tunes, and became a popular attraction. \n\nIn 1927, talent scout [[H. C. Speir]] signed him to a [[recording contract]] with [[Vocalion Records]]. On October 10, 1927, he recorded \"[[Jim Jackson's Kansas City Blues]]\", which became a best-seller, and in the [[melody]] and [[lyrics]] of which can be traced the outline of many later blues and [[rock and roll]] songs, including \"[[Rock Around The Clock]]\" and \"[[Kansas City (R&B song)|Kansas City]]\".  Following his [[hit record|hit]] Jackson recorded a series of 'Kansas City' follow-ups and soundalikes. It also led to other artists covering and reworking the song, including [[Charlie Patton]], who changed it to \"Gonna Move To Alabama\".<ref name=\"russell\">{{cite book\n| first= Tony\n| last= Russell\n| year= 1997\n| title= The Blues: From Robert Johnson to Robert Cray\n| edition= \n| publisher= Carlton Books Limited \n| location= Dubai\n| page= 121\n| isbn= 1-85868-255-X}}</ref> Jackson moved to Memphis in 1928, and made a series of further recordings, including the comic medicine show song \"I Heard the Voice of a Pork Chop\".
