He was also quite versatile, however, and worked in jazz bands including larger ensembles that used written arrangements. Although he did not read music, he learned band routines by ear, once through an [[arrangement]] and he had it memorized.\n\n==Career==\nMontgomery was born in the town of [[Kentwood, Louisiana|Kentwood]], [[Louisiana]], a sawmill town near the [[Mississippi]] Border, across [[Lake Pontchartrain]] from the city of [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]], where he spent much of his childhood. As a child he looked like his father, Harper Montgomery, and was called Little Brother Harper.  The name evolved into Little Brother Montgomery, a nickname which stuck.  He started playing piano at the age of 4, and by age 11 he was playing at various [[Juke joint|barrelhouses]] in Louisiana.  His own musical influences were [[Jelly Roll Morton]] who used visit the Montgomery household.\n\nEarly on he played at [[African American]] lumber and turpentine camps in Louisiana and [[Mississippi]], then with the bands of Clarence Desdunes and [[Buddy Petit]]. He first went to [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]] from 1928 to 1931, where he made his first recordings. From 1931 through 1938 he led a band in [[Jackson, Mississippi|Jackson]].\n\nIn 1942 Montgomery moved back to Chicago, which would be his base for the rest of his life, with various tours to other [[United States]] cities and [[Europe]].<ref name=\"Allmusic biography\"/> In the late 1950s he was \"discovered\" by wider white audiences. He toured briefly with [[Otis Rush]] in 1956.<ref name=\"allaboutjazz.com\">[http://www.allaboutjazz.com/php/musician.php?id=9523 Allboutjazz.com - accessed January 2008]</ref> His fame grew in the 1960s, and he continued to make many recordings, including on his own [[record label]], FM Records (formed in 1969).<ref name=\"Allmusic biography\"/>  FM came from Floberg, his wife Jan's [[maiden name]] and Montgomery, his own [[surname]].\n\nMontgomery toured Europe several times in the 1960s, and recorded some of his albums there.<ref name=\"russell\">{{cite book\n| first= Tony\n| last= Russell\n| year= 1997\n| title= The Blues: From Robert Johnson to Robert Cray\n| edition= \n| publisher= Carlton Books Limited \n| location= Dubai\n| pages= 146\n| isbn= 1-85868-255-X}}</ref> Montgomery appeared at many blues and folk [[music festival|festivals]] during the following decade and was considered a living legend, a link to the early days of blues and New Orleans.<ref name=\"allaboutjazz.com\"/>\n\nAmong his original compositions are \"Shreveport Farewell\", \"Farrish Street Jive\", and \"Vicksburg Blues\". His instrumental \"Crescent City Blues\" served as the basis for [[Crescent City Blues|a song of the same name]] by [[Gordon Jenkins]], which in turn was adapted by [[Johnny Cash]] as \"[[Folsom Prison Blues]].\"<ref>{{cite book | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=CIS8SOVAVjMC&pg=PA92&lpg=PA92&dq=%22crescent+city+blues%22+%22gordon+jenkins%22&source=bl&ots=eDzPwXmzRf&sig=5bl4HCiM4FzWHxkPTxo1-EcsFnk&hl=en&sa=X&ei=qZ9tULnAOYeliQLTiICIBg&ved=0CD8Q6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=%22crescent%20city%20blues%22%20%22gordon%20jenkins%22&f=false| title=Nine Choices: Johnny Cash and American Culture | publisher=University of Massachusetts Press | date=September 30, 2010 |accessdate=October 4, 2012 | author=Silverman, Jonathan | pages=92}}</ref>\n\nIn 1968, Montgomery contributed to two albums by [[Spanky and Our Gang]]; ''[[Like to Get to Know You (album)|Like to Get to Know You]]'' and ''Anything You Choose b/w Without Rhyme Or Reason''.\n\nMontgomery died on September 6, 1985, in [[Champaign, Illinois|Champaign]], [[Illinois]], and is interred in the [[Oak Woods Cemetery]].\n\nIn 2013, Montgomery was posthumously inducted to the [[Blues Hall of Fame]].<ref name=\"BHOF\">{{cite web|url=https://www.blues.org/#ref=index|title=2013 Blues Hall of Fame Inductees Announced|publisher=Blues.org|accessdate=2013-03-06}}</ref>\n\n[[Paul Gayten]] is his [[nephew]].\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of Chicago blues musicians]]\n*[[Adelphi Records]]\n*[[77 Records]]\n*[[Wikipedia:Find-A-Grave famous people/M/Mit]]\n*[[List of people from Louisiana]]\n*[[List of blues musicians]]\n\n==Further information==\n*''The Story of Little Brother Montgomery'' by Karl Gert zur Heide, [[publisher|published]] by Studio Vista, [[London]], in 1970, provides an overview of his life and early career.\n\n*The October 1985 issue of ''[[The Mississippi Rag]]'' has an article on Little Brother Montgomery by Paige Van Vorst.
