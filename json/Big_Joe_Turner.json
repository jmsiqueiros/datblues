His father was killed in a train accident when Joe was only four years old. He first discovered a love of music in his involvement at church. He began singing on street corners for money, quitting school at age fourteen to work in Kansas City's nightclubs, first as a cook, and later as a singing bartender. He became known eventually as '''The Singing Barman''', and worked in such venues as The Kingfish Club and The Sunset, where he and his piano playing partner [[Pete Johnson]] became resident performers.<ref name=\"Rockhall\"/> The Sunset was managed by Piney Brown. It featured \"separate but equal\" facilities for caucasian patrons. Turner wrote \"Piney Brown Blues\" in his honor and sang it throughout his entire career.\n\nAt that time Kansas City nightclubs were subject to frequent raids by the police, but as Turner recounts, \"The Boss man would have his bondsmen down at the police station before we got there. We'd walk in, sign our names and walk right out. Then we would cabaret until morning\".\n\nHis partnership with [[boogie-woogie]] pianist Pete Johnson proved fruitful.<ref name=\"Rockhall\"/> Together they went to New York City in 1936, where they appeared on a playbill with [[Benny Goodman]], but as Turner recounts, \"After our show with Goodman, we auditioned at several places, but New York wasn't ready for us yet, so we headed back to K.C.\". Eventually they were witnessed by the talent scout, [[John Hammond (producer)|John H. Hammond]] in 1938, who invited them back to New York to appear in one of his \"[[From Spirituals to Swing]]\" concerts at [[Carnegie Hall]], which were instrumental in introducing [[jazz]] and [[blues]] to a wider American audience.<ref name=\"Rockhall\"/>\n\nDue in part to their appearance at Carnegie Hall, Turner and Johnson had a major success with the song \"[[Roll 'Em Pete]]\".<ref name=\"Rockhall\"/> The track, basically a collection of [[Traditional blues verses|traditional blues lyrics]] featured one of the earliest recorded examples of a [[beat (music)|back beat]]. It was a song that Turner recorded many times, with various combinations of musicians, over the ensuing years.\n\n===1939 to 1950===\nIn 1939, along with boogie players [[Albert Ammons]] and [[Meade Lux Lewis]], they began a residency at [[Caf\u00e9 Society]], a nightclub in New York City, where they appeared on the same playbill as [[Billie Holiday]] and Frank Newton's band.<ref name=\"Rockhall\"/> Besides \"Roll 'Em, Pete\", Turner's best-known recordings from this period are probably \"Cherry Red\", \"I Want A Little Girl\" and \"Wee Baby Blues\". \"Cherry Red\" was recorded in 1939 for the [[Vocalion Records|Vocalion]] [[record label|label]], with [[Hot Lips Page]] on [[trumpet]] and a full band in attendance.<ref name=\"AMG\">{{cite web |first= |last= |url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p556/biography|pure_url=yes}}|title=Biography by Bill Dahl |publisher=Allmusic.com |accessdate=November 17, 2009}}</ref> The next year Turner contracted with [[Decca Records|Decca]] and recorded \"Piney Brown Blues\", with Johnson on piano.<ref name=\"AMG\"/>\n\nIn 1941, he went to Los Angeles and performed in [[Duke Ellington|Duke Ellington's]] revue ''Jump for Joy'' in Hollywood.  He appeared as a singing policeman in a comedy sketch called \"He's on the Beat\". Los Angeles was his home for a time, and during 1944 he worked in [[Meade Lux Lewis|Meade Lux Lewis's]] [[Soundies]] musical movies. Although he sang on the soundtrack recordings, he was not present for filming, and his vocals were mouthed by comedian [[Dudley Dickerson]] for the camera. In 1945 Turner and Pete Johnson established their bar in Los Angeles, The Blue Moon Club.\n\nThat same year he contracted with [[National Records]] company, and recorded under [[Herb Abramson|Herb Abramson's]] supervision. His first hit single was a cover of [[Saunders King|Saunders King's]] \"S.K. Blues\" (1945).<ref name=\"whitburnr&b\"/> He recorded the songs \"My Gal's A Jockey\" and the risqu\u00e9 \"Around The Clock\" the same year, and the [[Aladdin Records|Aladdin]] company released \"Battle of the Blues\", a duet with [[Wynonie Harris]]. Turner stayed with National until 1947, but none of his recordings were great sellers.<ref name=\"AMG\"/> In 1950, he released the song \"Still in the Dark\" on [[Freedom Records]].<ref name=\"whitburnr&b\"/>\n\nTurner made many albums with Johnson, [[Art Tatum]], [[Sammy Price]], and other jazz groups.<ref name=\"russell\"/> He recorded with several recording companies and also performed with the [[Count Basie Orchestra]].<ref name=\"Rockhall\"/> During his career, Turner was part of the transition from [[big band]]s to [[jump blues]] to [[rhythm and blues]], and finally to [[rock and roll]]. Turner was a master of [[traditional blues verses]] and at Kansas City [[jam session]]s he could swap choruses with instrumental soloists for hours.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}}\n\n===Success during the 1950s===\n[[File:Big Joe Turner Rock and Roll Revue Apollo Theater 1955.jpg|thumb|Big Joe Turner performing on the Rock and Roll Revue (1955)]]\nIn 1951, while performing with the Count Basie Orchestra at Harlem's [[Apollo Theater]] as a replacement for [[Jimmy Rushing]], he was spotted by [[Ertegun brothers|Ahmet and Nesuhi Erteg\u00fcn]], who contracted him to their new recording company, [[Atlantic Records]].<ref name=\"Rockhall\"/> Turner recorded a number of successes for them, including the [[List of blues standards|blues standard]]s, \"[[Chains of Love (Ahmet Ertegun song)|Chains of Love]]\"<ref name=pc3>{{Gilliland|url=http://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc19748/m1/ |title=Show 3 - The Tribal Drum: The rise of rhythm and blues.

Ow! That's just what I need!\" ) and \"[[Honey Hush]]\" (he repeatedly sings \"Hi-yo, Silver!\", probably in reference to [[The Treniers]] singing the phrase for their [[Lone Ranger]] parody \"Ride, Red, Ride\"). Turner's records scored at the top of the rhythm-and-blues charts; although they were sometimes so risqu\u00e9 that some radio stations would not play them, the songs received much play on jukeboxes and records.\n\nTurner had a great success during 1954 with \"[[Shake, Rattle and Roll]]\", which seriously enhanced his career, turning him into a teenage favorite, and also helped to transform popular music.<ref name=\"Rockhall\"/> During the song, Turner yells at his woman to \"get outa that bed, wash yo' face an' hands\" and comments that she's \"wearin' those dresses, the sun comes shinin' through!, I can't believe my eyes, all that mess belongs to you.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.history-of-rock.com/shake_rattle_and_roll.htm |title=Shake Rattle And Roll |publisher=History-of-rock.com |date=1954-04-28 |accessdate=2013-06-30}}</ref> He sang the number on film for the 1955 theatrical feature ''Rhythm and Blues Revue''.\n\nAlthough the cover version of the song by [[Bill Haley & His Comets]], with the risqu\u00e9 lyrics partially omitted, was a greater sales success, many listeners sought out Turner's version and were introduced thereby to rhythm and blues. [[Elvis Presley]]'s version of \"Shake, Rattle and Roll\" combined Turner's lyrics with Haley's arrangement, but was not a successful  single.\n\n\"The Chicken and the Hawk\", \"[[Flip, Flop and Fly]]\",<ref name=pc3/> \"Hide and Seek,\" \"Morning, Noon and Night,\" and \"Well All Right\" were successful recordings from this period.<ref name=\"AMG\"/> He performed on the [[television program]] ''[[Showtime at the Apollo]]'' and in the movie ''[[Shake, Rattle & Rock! (1956 film)|Shake Rattle & Rock!]]'' (1956).<ref name=\"AMG\"/>\n\nThe song \"[[Corrine, Corrina]]\" was another great seller during 1956.<ref name=\"AMG\"/> In addition to the rock music songs, he released ''Boss of the Blues'' album in 1956.<ref name=\"russell\"/> \"(I\u2019m Gonna) Jump for Joy\", his last hit, reached the US R&B record chart on May 26, 1958.<ref name=\"Rockhall\"/>\n\n===Returning to the blues===\nAfter a number of successes in this vein, Turner quit popular music and resumed singing with small jazz combos, recording numerous albums in that style during the 1960s and 1970s.<ref name=\"Rockhall\"/> During 1966, [[Bill Haley]] helped revive Turner's career by lending the Comets for a series of popular recordings in Mexico.<ref name=\"AMG\"/> In 1977 he recorded a cover version of [[Guitar Slim|Guitar Slim's]] song, \"[[The Things That I Used to Do]]\".\n\nDuring the 1960s and 1970s he resumed performing jazz and blues music, performing at many music festivals and recording for [[Norman Granz]]'s company [[Pablo Records]].<ref name=\"AMG\"/><ref name=\"russell\"/> He also worked with [[Axel Zwingenberger]].<ref name=\"russell\">{{cite book\n| first= Tony\n| last= Russell\n| year= 1997\n| title= The Blues - From [[Robert Johnson (musician)|Robert Johnson]] to [[Robert Cray]]\n| edition= \n| publisher=Carlton Books Limited \n| location= Dubai\n| pages= 178\u201379\n| isbn= 1-85868-255-X}}</ref> Turner also participated in a 'Battle of the Blues' with [[Wynonie Harris]] and [[T-Bone Walker]].<ref name=\"russell 2\">{{cite book\n| first= Tony\n| last= Russell\n| year= 1997\n| title= The Blues - From [[Robert Johnson (musician)|Robert Johnson]] to [[Robert Cray]]\n| edition= \n| publisher=Carlton Books Limited \n| location= Dubai\n| page= 117\n| isbn= 1-85868-255-X}}</ref>\n\nDuring 1965 he toured in England with trumpeter [[Buck Clayton]] and trombonist [[Vic Dickenson]], accompanied by [[Humphrey Lyttelton]] and his Band. Part of a studio concert was televised by the BBC and later issued on DVD. A sound recording of a club appearance made during this tour is not thought of sufficient sound quality to justify commercial issue. He also toured Europe with [[Count Basie]] and his Orchestra.\n\nHe won the ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'' magazine award for male vocalist in 1945, the ''[[Melody Maker]]'' award for best 'new' vocalist during 1956, and the British ''Jazz Journal'' award as top male singer during 1965. In 1977, Turner recorded \"[[I'm Gonna Sit Right Down and Write Myself a Letter]]\" for [[Spivey Records]], featuring [[Lloyd Glenn]] on piano. Turner's career endured from the bar rooms of Kansas City in the 1920s (when at the age of twelve he performed with a pencilled moustache and his father's hat), to European jazz music festivals of the 1980s.\n\nIn 1983, only two years before his death, Turner was inducted into the [[Blues Hall of Fame]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.infoplease.com/ipea/A0151040.html |title=Blues Foundation Hall of Fame |publisher=Infoplease.com |date= |accessdate=2013-06-30}}</ref> That same year, the album ''Blues Train'' was released by [[Mute Records]] company; the album had Turner paired with the team [[Roomful of Blues]].<ref name=\"Rockhall\"/>  Turner received top billing  with [[Count Basie]] in the [[Kansas City jazz]] reunion movie ''[[The Last of the Blue Devils]]'' (1979) featuring [[Jay McShann]],  [[Jimmy Forrest]], and other players from the city.\n\n===Death===\nHe died in Inglewood, California in November 1985, at the age of 74 of heart failure, having suffered the earlier effects of arthritis, a stroke and diabetes.
