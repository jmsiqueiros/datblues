After relocating to [[Memphis, Tennessee]] in 1959,<ref name=\"Engine\"/> Ironing Board Sam organised his own band and got his [[stage name]] from his habit of strapping his legless [[Keyboard instrument|keyboard]] on top of an [[ironing board]] when performing.<ref name=\"AMG\"/> Although he disliked his stage name he later turned it to an advantage by giving away ironing boards at some of his concerts.<ref name=\"Engine\"/> In 1962, he was backed by a band containing a youthful [[Jimi Hendrix]].\n\nHe moved around the United States trying to get a [[recording contract]], eventually issuing a handful of [[Single (music)|singles]] with [[Atlantic Records|Atlantic]], Styletone and [[Holiday Inn Records|Holiday Inn]] in the late 1960s and early 1970s.<ref name=\"Engine\"/> He also performed on ''Night Train'' in the mid 1960s.<ref name=\"Music Maker\"/>   \n\nHis performing technique was unusual and he developed the eccentric personae in several directions. He invented his own 'button keyboard', which had a regular keyboard arrangement underneath which was fitted guitar strings. Rudimentary electronics gave him a three pronged sound, which he used primarily when billed as the 'Eighth Wonder of the World' while performing as a duo with his drummer Kerry Brown.<ref name=\"Access\">{{cite web|url=http://www.bluesaccess.com/No_24/ironing.html|title=40 years with the Eighth Wonder of the World, the Human Jukebox, Little George and a 1,500-gallon tank filled with water|publisher=Blues Access|date=1996|accessdate=2012-10-16}}</ref> In 1978, his intention to perform in a [[hot air balloon]] was only aborted due to adverse weather conditions.<ref name=\"Access\"/> At the [[New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival]] a year later he played in a 1,500 gallon filled water tank. By 1982, when he had moved back to [[New Orleans]],<ref name=\"Engine\"/> he had developed the idea of being a human [[jukebox]], so that he only played when people inserted coins into his jukebox styled costume. He worked the Latin Quarter and got some club work via an appearance on the [[television program]], ''[[Real People]]''.<ref name=\"Engine\"/> In the late 1980s he was accompanied by a toy monkey, known as 'Little George', that was rigged to play in synchronization with a [[drum machine]]. His live sets more latterly featured a mix of blues and [[jazz]]. \n\nIn 1990, Ironing Board Sam toured Europe, and in 1996 his debut album, ''Human Touch'' was released.<ref name=\"Engine\"/> \n\nIroning Board Sam joined the [[Music Maker (label)|Music Maker Relief Foundation]] in 2010, and moved to [[Chapel Hill, North Carolina]]. He was provided with new musical equipment, recorded a new album and played at the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival in April 2012.<ref name=\"Music Maker\">{{cite web|url=http://www.musicmaker.org/artists/ironing-board-sam/|title=Ironing Board Sam|publisher=Music Maker Relief Foundation|date=1996|accessdate=2012-10-16}}</ref><ref name=\"Billboard\">{{cite web|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/pictures/2012-new-orleans-jazz-heritage-festival-20120430/ironing-board-sam-0639020|title=2012 New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival|publisher=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|accessdate=2012-10-16}}</ref>  \n\nIn late 2012 and 2013, Ironing Board Sam played a series of concerts across North Carolina.<ref name=\"Music Maker\"/> In March 2014, he appeared at the Steel City Blues Festival.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.steelcitybluesfestival.com/ |title=Steel City Blues Festival 2014 |publisher=Steelcitybluesfestival.com |date= |accessdate=2014-03-23}}</ref>\n\n==Discography==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!
