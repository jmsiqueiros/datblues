He was the illegitimate son of 15-year-old Leola Brooks, a field hand. His father was probably Joe Willie \"Frost\" James, who moved in with Leola, and so Elmore took this as his name. His parents adopted an orphaned boy at some point named Robert Holston.\n\nElmore began making music at the age of 12 using a simple one-string instrument (\"[[diddley bow]]\" or \"jitterbug\") strung up on a shack wall. As a teen he was playing at local dances under the names '''Cleanhead''' and '''Joe Willie James'''. His first marriage, circa 1942, was to Minnie Mae (maiden name unknown? and whom he apparently never divorced).<ref name=Amazing>Franz, Steve. ''The Amazing Secret History of Elmore James'', BlueSource Publications, 2003.</ref>\nHe subsequently married twice more, to Georgianna Crump in 1947 and to a woman called Janice circa 1954. (Another reported marriage of Elmore to a Josephine Harris has been found to be a mistaken record of a different Elmore James.)\n\nJames (like many other musicians) was strongly influenced by [[Robert Johnson]], as well as by [[Kokomo Arnold]] and [[Tampa Red]]. James recorded several of Tampa's songs, and even inherited from his band two of his famous \"Broomdusters\", [[Little Johnny Jones (pianist)|\"Little\" Johnny Jones]] (piano) and [[Odie Payne]] (drums). There is a dispute as to whether Robert Johnson or Elmore wrote James' trademark song, \"[[Dust My Broom]]\".<ref name=\"Amazing\"/>\n\nDuring [[World War II]] James joined the [[United States Navy]], was promoted to coxswain and took part in the invasion of [[Guam]] against the Japanese. Upon his discharge, James returned to central Mississippi and eventually settled in [[Canton, Mississippi|Canton]] with his adopted brother Robert Holston; it was at this time he learned that he had a serious heart condition. Working in Robert's electrical shop, he devised his unique electric sound, using parts from the shop and an unusual placement of two D'Armond pickups.<ref name=Amazing /> He began recording with [[Trumpet Records]] in nearby Jackson in January 1951, first as sideman to the second [[Sonny Boy Williamson II|Sonny Boy Williamson]] and also to their mutual friend Wille Love and possibly others, then debuting as a session leader in August with \"Dust My Broom\".<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/> It was a surprise R&B hit in 1952 and turned James into a star. He then broke his [[recording contract]] with Trumpet Records to sign up with the Bihari Brothers through their \"scout\" [[Ike Turner]] (who played [[guitar]] and [[piano]] on a couple of his early Bihari recordings). His \"I Believe\" was another hit a year later.<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/>  During the 1950s he recorded for the [[Bihari brothers]]' [[Flair Records]], [[Meteor Records]]<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://home.earthlink.net/~jaymar41/meteor.html\n|title=Meteor Records\n|publisher=\n|accessdate=2006-11-06\n}}</ref>  and [[Modern Records]] labels, as well as for [[Chess Records]] and [[Mel London]]'s [[Chief Records]] (his \"[[It Hurts Me Too]]\" was later a hit when he re-recorded it for [[Enjoy Records]]).<ref>\n{{cite book\n| last = Whitburn\n| first = Joel\n| authorlink =\n| coauthors =\n| title = Top R&B Singles 1942-1988\n| publisher = Record Research, Inc\n| year = 1988\n| location =\n| page = 216\n| url =\n| doi =\n| id =\n| isbn = 978-0-89820-068-3}}\n</ref>  He also played lead guitar on [[Big Joe Turner|Joe Turner]]'s 1954 top 10 R&B hit \"TV Mama.\" <ref>Swyner, Alan, liner notes to The Very Best of Big Joe Turner, Rhino 72968 (CD), 1998</ref> His backing musicians were known as the Broomdusters.<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/> In 1959 he began recording for [[Bobby Robinson (record producer)|Bobby Robinson]]'s [[Fire Records]] label. These include \"[[The Sky Is Crying (song)|The Sky Is Crying]]\" (credited to Elmo James and His Broomdusters), \"[[Bleeding Heart (song)|My Bleeding Heart]]\", \"Stranger Blues\", \"[[Look on Yonder Wall]]\", \"Done Somebody Wrong\", and \"[[Shake Your Moneymaker (song)|Shake Your Moneymaker]]\", all of which are among the most famous of blues recordings.<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/>\n\nElmore James enjoyed drinking [[whiskey]], particularly [[Moonshine]] whiskey, which he began drinking at an early age and also distilled himself, despite alcohol contributing to the premature deaths of bandmates and friends Willie Love and Johnny Jones.<ref name=\"Amazing\" /> James' regular rhythm guitarist claimed that he preserved his health by not drinking as heavily during and after gigs, a refusal that made him unpopular with the rest of the band.<ref name=\"Amazing\" />\n\nJames died of his third [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] in [[Chicago]] in 1963,<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/> just prior to a tour of Europe with that year's American Folk Blues Festival. He was buried in the Newport Baptist Church Cemetery in [[Ebenezer, Mississippi|Ebenezer]], Mississippi.\n\n==Sound==\nJames played a wide variety of \"blues\" (which often crossed over into other styles of music) similar to that of [[Muddy Waters]], [[Howlin' Wolf]] and some of [[B. B. King]]'s work, but distinguished by his guitar's unique tone coming from a modified, hollow body traditional acoustic guitar, which sounded like an amped up version of the \"more modern\" solid body guitars. He most often played using a slide, but on several recordings he plays without. His voice and style were as instantly recognisable as King's, Muddy's and Wolf's and until he fell afoul of the Chicago union, he and his 'Broomdusters' were as popular in the Chicago clubs as any of these musicians' bands. James could be reportedly 'difficult' (drinking on the job, not paying out cash, abandoning musicians, double booking etc.) There are few photos of James performing, those taken (some at the following occasion, and some at a packed club with stylishly dressed couples dancing closely) by George Adins, and no other detailed descriptions or any live recordings.\n\n[[Muddy Waters]] took the Belgian blues fan George Adins to see James play in Chicago in 1959, Adins recalled, <blockquote>\nElmore will always remain the most exciting, dramatic blues singer and guitarist that I've ever had a chance to see perform in the flesh. On our way we listened to him on the radio as Big Bill Hill ... was broadcasting direct from that place. I was burning to see Elmore James and before we even pushed open the door of the club, we could hear Elmore's violent guitar sound. Although the place was overcrowded, we managed to find a seat close to the bandstand and the blues came falling down on me as it had never done before. Watching Elmore sing and play, backed by a solid blues band (Homesick James, J.T. Brown, Boyd Atkins and Sam Cassell) made me feel real fine. Wearing thick glasses, Elmore's face always had an expressive and dramatic look, especially when he was real gone on the slow blues. Singing with a strong and rough voice, he really didn't need a mike. On such slow blues as \"I'm Worried - \"Make My Dreams Come True\" - \"It Hurts Me\", his voice reached a climax and created a tension that  was unmistakably the down and out blues. Notwithstanding that raw voice, Elmore sang his blues with a particular feeling, an emotion and depth that showed his country background. His singing was... fed, reinforced by his own guitar accompaniment which was as rough, violent and expressive as was his voice. Using the bottleneck technique most of the time, Elmore really let his guitar sound as I had never heard a guitar sound before. You just couldn't sit still! You had to move...\n</blockquote>\nAdins also witnessed James at 'Alex Club' in West Side Chicago where... <blockquote>\n...he always played for a dance audience and he made the people jump. \"Bobby's Rock\" was at that time one of the favourite numbers with the crowd and Elmore used to play [it] for fifteen minutes and more. You just couldn't stand that hysteric sound coming down on you. The place was rocking, swinging!<ref>Bromberg liner notes to the compilation ''The Legend Of Elmore James'' (Kent Records 9001).</ref> </blockquote>\n\nThe nearest we have to a recording of a 'live' set by James is his last recorded session by Bobby Robinson, in New York City in 1963 shortly before James' death. This session features several takes of \"Hand In Hand\" which was abandoned and James then played a 'live' set.\n\nHis best known song is the [[blues standard]] \"Dust My Broom\" (also known as \"Dust My Blues\"). The song gave its name to James' band, '''The Broomdusters'''.  The song's opening slide guitar [[riff]] is one of the best-known sounds in all of blues. It is essentially the same riff that appeared in the recording of the same song by [[Robert Johnson (musician)|Robert Johnson]], but James played the riff with electric slide guitar. [[B. B. King]] used this riff to open his 1953 #1 R&B hit \"Please Love Me.\"  It was even transformed into a [[doo-wop]] chorus on [[Jesse Stone]]'s \"Down in the Alley\", recorded by [[The Clovers]] and [[Elvis Presley]]. Stone transcribed the riff as: \"Changety changety changety changety chang chang!\"\n\n==Influence==\nMany electric [[slide guitar]] players will admit to the influence of James' style.  He was also a major influence on such successful blues  guitarists as [[Homesick James]], [[John Littlejohn]], [[Hound Dog Taylor]], [[J. B. Hutto]] and many others. He also influenced many rock guitarists such as [[The Rolling Stones]]' [[Brian Jones]] ([[Keith Richards]] wrote in his book that at the time he met Brian Jones, Brian called himself Elmo Lewis, and that he wanted to be Elmore James), [[Canned Heat]]'s [[Alan Wilson (musician)|Alan Wilson]] and in particular [[Fleetwood Mac]]'s [[Jeremy Spencer]].\n[[John Mayall]] included \"Mr. James\" on his 1969 \"Looking Back\" album as a dedication to James. James' songs \"Done Somebody Wrong\" and \"[[One Way Out (song)|One Way Out]]\" were often covered by [[The Allman Brothers Band]], who were influenced by James.<ref>{{cite book | url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=1Mdf4BOnI9IC&pg=PA102&dq=allman+brothers+influence+elmore+james&hl=en&sa=X&ei=hNqqUZSwHqnAiQe-_4HAAQ&ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=allman%20brothers%20influence%20elmore%20james&f=false | title=Blues singers | accessdate=2013-06-02 | author=Dicaire, David}}</ref> James was also covered by blues-rock band [[Stevie Ray Vaughan|Stevie Ray Vaughan and Double Trouble]] many times in concert. The most famous of these covers is one that came by an indirect route - James' fellow bluesman [[Albert King]] recorded a cover of \"The Sky Is Crying\", and Stevie Ray Vaughan copied King's version of the song. That song was also covered by [[George Thorogood]] on his second album, ''[[Move It On Over (album)|Move It On Over]]'' and by Eric Clapton on his album ''[[There's One in Every Crowd]]''.\n\nThe most famous guitarist who admired James was [[Jimi Hendrix]]. Early in his career Hendrix styled himself variously as 'Maurice James' and subsequently as 'Jimmy James.' This, according to former bandmate and recording partner [[Lonnie Youngblood]], was a tribute to Elmore James.<ref>Egan, Sean. ''The Making of \"Are You Experienced\"'', A Capella Books, 2002, p. 14.</ref> There is a photo of Hendrix (that can be seen in the sleeve of his ''[[Blues (Jimi Hendrix album)|Blues]]'' album) in London wearing his iconic military jacket and holding Elmore James's UK LP ''The Best Of Elmore James.'' (Hendrix was frequently photographed throughout his performing career holding LP covers of musicians that influenced him.) He performed James' \"Bleeding Heart\" during the Experience's [[Royal Albert Hall]] concert in 1969, and also with the [[Band of Gypsys]] at their New Year's concerts at the Fillmore East in 1969/70 as well as recording two different versions of it in the studio.\n\nJames is mentioned in [[The Beatles]]' song \"[[For You Blue]]\": while [[John Lennon]] plays the slide guitar (James' trademark), [[George Harrison]] says, \"Elmore James got nothin' on this, baby.\" Other artists influenced by Elmore James include [[Frank Zappa]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://home.online.no/~corneliu/gp83.htm |title=Guitar Player Magazine, 1983 |publisher=Home.online.no |date=1984-01-09 |accessdate=2011-12-30}}</ref>\n\n[[The Grateful Dead]], [[John Primer]] (''Blue Steel'' CD), [[Billy Gibbons]] and [[Eric Clapton]] are other notable artists to have recorded Elmore James covers. Clapton also recorded a song with [[Jimmy Page]] called \"[[Immediate All-Stars|Tribute to Elmore]]\" that first appeared on the 1968 compilation album ''[[Blues Anytime Vol. 1]]''.\nOn the 1974 record ''Second Album'', [[Roy Buchanan]] included an instrumental song he wrote titled \"Tribute to Elmore James,\" which begins with James' classic slide guitar riff, and uses his soloing style throughout.\n\nJames's older cousin [[Homesick James|\"Homesick\" James Williamson]], a regular companion from an early age, played with James in the Broomdusters from 1957 on.\n\n==Discography==\n{{Main|Elmore James discography}}\n===Selected singles===\n* \"[[Dust My Broom]]\" (1951 & 1965)\n* \"[[Dust My Blues|I Believe]]\" (1953)\n* \"[[Cross Road Blues#Elmore James versions|Standing at the Crossroads]]\" (1954 & 1965)\n* \"[[Dust My Blues]]\" (1955)\n* \"[[It Hurts Me Too#Elmore James versions|It Hurts Me Too]]\" (1957 & 1965)\n* \"[[The Sky Is Crying (song)|The Sky Is Crying]]\" (1960)\n* \"[[I Can't Hold Out]]\" (1960)\n* \"[[Rollin' and Tumblin']]\" (1960)\n* \"[[Shake Your Moneymaker (song)|Shake Your Moneymaker]]\" (1961)\n* \"[[Look on Yonder Wall#Elmore James version|Look on Yonder Wall]]\" (1961)\n* \"[[Bleeding Heart (song)|Bleeding Heart]]\" (1965)\n* \"[[One Way Out (song)|One Way Out]]\" (1965)\n* \"[[Every Day I Have the Blues]]\" (1965)\n\n===Selected compilation albums===\n* ''Blues After Hours'' (1960)\n* ''Whose Muddy Shoes'' (1969)\n* ''Street Talkin''' (1975)\n* ''Elmore James \u2014 King of the Slide Guitar'' (1992)\n* ''Elmore James \u2014 The Classic Early Records 1951\u20131956'' (1993)\n* ''The Sky Is Crying: The History of Elmore James'' (1993)\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.wirz.de/music/jameselm.htm Illustrated Elmore James discography]\n*[http://musicbrainz.org/artist/6fbd2cfb-5f9c-497c-8e06-3c6668367681.html Discography] at [[MusicBrainz]]\n*[http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&GRid=5766 Elmore James on Find-A-Grave]\n*[http://mtzionmemorialfund.org/site/memorials/elmore-james/ Elmore James | Mount Zion Memorial Fund]\n*[http://www.blues.org/halloffame/inductees.php4?YearId=25 1980 Blues Foundation Hall of Fame Inductee]\n*[http://www.mnblues.com/review/2003/elmorejames-secrethistory-bk-cr.html Review of ''The Amazing Secret History of Elmore James'']\n{{Elmore James}}\n{{Authority control|VIAF=49408406}}\n\n{{Persondata  \n| NAME              = James, Elmore\n| ALTERNATIVE NAMES = James, Brooks\n| SHORT DESCRIPTION = [[United States|American]] blues guitarist, singer, songwriter and bandleader\n| DATE OF BIRTH     = January 27, 1918\n| PLACE OF BIRTH    = [[Holmes County, Mississippi]], United States\n| DATE OF DEATH     = May 24, 1963\n| PLACE OF DEATH    = [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]], United States\n}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:James, Elmore}}\n[[Category:1918 births]]\n[[Category:1963 deaths]]\n[[Category:African-American musicians]]\n[[Category:American blues singers]]\n[[Category:American male singers]]\n[[Category:Blues Hall of Fame inductees]]\n[[Category:Blues musicians from Mississippi]]\n[[Category:American blues guitarists]]\n[[Category:Deaths from myocardial infarction]]\n[[Category:Slide guitarists]]\n\n{{Link GA|uk}}"}]}}}}
