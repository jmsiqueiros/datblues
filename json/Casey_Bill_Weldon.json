Playing a National steel guitar flat on his lap Hawaiian style, \"Casey Bill\" Weldon's was known as the \"Hawaiian Guitar Wizard\".   He was married to singer and guitarist [[Memphis Minnie]] in the '20s. Weldon played in [[medicine show]]s before beginning his recording career in 1927 for Victor. \n\nIn  1927 Weldon made a recording with Charles Polk and other members of what would become the [[Memphis Jug Band]] for [[Victor Talking Machine Company|Victor Records]]. In October of that year, Victor brought them to [[Atlanta]] where they recorded several sides, including \"[[Jim Jackson's Kansas City Blues|Kansas City Blues]]\". In 1930, the last year of the [[Memphis Jug Band]]'s contract with Victor, the band recorded 20 sides. The contract ended after a final recording session in November 1930 in [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]] just before the financial crash of the 1930s bankrupted Victor.<ref>{{cite book| last = Charters| first = Samuel| title = The Blues Makers| publisher = Da Capo Press| year = 1977| location = New York| pages = 17\u201322, Part II| isbn = 0-306-80438-7 }}</ref> Weldon went on to cut over 60 sides for Victor, Bluebird, and Vocalion.  He was also an active session guitarist appearing on records by [[Teddy Darby]], [[Bumble Bee Slim]], [[Peetie Wheatstraw]], and [[Memphis Minnie]]. On [[Memphis Minnie]]'s last recording for [[Bluebird Records]] in October 1935, Weldon accompanied her for the first time. He played on two sides, \"When the Sun Goes Down, Part 2\" and \"Hustlin' Woman Blues.\" <ref name=minnie>{{cite book| last = Garon| first = Paul and Beth| title = Woman With Guitar:Memphis Minnie's Blues| publisher = Da Capo Press| year = 1992| location = New York| isbn = 0-306-80460-3| page = 39 }}</ref> He scored solo hits with his two most well known songs, \"Somebody Changed the Lock on My Door\" and \"We Gonna Move (to the Outskirts of Town).\"\n\nIn October 1927, when the Victor field recording unit visited [[Atlanta, Georgia|Atlanta]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], he recorded two sides, including a chilling, haunting [[song]] called \"Turpentine Blues\", which would have left him immortalized if he had never recorded again.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} He did not enter another recording studio until eight years later, when he laid down many recordings for [[Vocalion Records]]. Weldon also played with Charlie Burse and the Picanniny Jug Band and the Brown Bombers of Swing.  Considering the fact that most slide guitarists of the era went unrecorded, Weldon maintains a healthy amount of recorded material for aficionados to appreciate.\n\nAfter his divorce from Memphis Minnie, he married blues singer [[Geeshie Wiley]]. They disappeared from the public eye soon after and he stopped recording by 1938. His date of death is unknown, though assumed to be sometime in the 1960s.<ref>[{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p34741/biography|pure_url=yes}} Casey Bill Weldon - Biography] (Retrieved October 10, 2006)</ref>\n\n==Style==\nHe played a National [[steel guitar]] flat on his lap Hawaiian style.
