King]], [[Meade Lux Lewis]], [[Amos Milburn]], and [[Pete Johnson]]. Walker first picked up the guitar at the age of eight, and became a known quantity within the Bay Area music scene by the age of 16. While publicly performing through his teens, he soaked up many influences (especially vocalists such as [[Wilson Pickett]], [[James Brown]], [[Bobby Womack]] and [[Otis Redding]]). Over these early years, Walker's musical pupilage saw him playing with [[John Lee Hooker]], [[J.J. Malone]], [[Buddy Miles]], [[Otis Rush]], [[Thelonious Monk]], The Soul Stirrers, [[Willie Dixon]], [[Charlie Musselwhite]], [[Steve Miller (musician)|Steve Miller]], [[Nick Lowe]], [[John Mayall]], [[Earl Hooker]], [[Muddy Waters]], and [[Jimi Hendrix]]. By 1968, he had forged a friendship with [[Mike Bloomfield]]; they were roommates for many years until Bloomfield's untimely death.<ref name=\"AMG\"/>\n\nThis event was the catalyst that placed Walker into a lifestyle change. He left the world of the blues and enrolled himself at [[San Francisco State University]], achieving a degree in Music and English. Throughout this time, Walker was regularly performing with The Spiritual Corinthians Gospel Quartet.<ref name=\"AMG\"/> After a 1985 performance at the [[New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival]], he was inspired to return to his blues roots whereupon he formed the \"Bosstalkers\" and signed to the [[HighTone Records|HighTone]] label. Under the auspices of [[Bruce Bromberg]] and Dennis Walker, his debut album, ''Cold Is The Night'' was released in 1986.<ref name=\"AMG\"/> He began a worldwide touring schedule, delivering a four more releases in succession for HighTone (''The Gift'' (1988), ''[[Blue Soul]]'' (1989), ''Live At Slims Vol 1'' (1991), and ''Live At Slims Volume 2'' (1992).\n\nAfter the long partnership with HighTone, Walker was signed by [[Polygram Records|Polygram]] to their [[Verve Records|Verve]]/Gitanes record label.<ref name=\"AMG\"/> His first of many Polygram releases ensued with ''Blues Survivor'' in 1993. This marked the beginning of an eclectic era that merged many of his gospel, jazz, soul, funk and rock influences with his trademark blues sensibilities. 1993 also saw the release of [[B.B. King]]'s [[Grammy Award]]-winning ''Blues Summit'' album, which featured a [[duet]] with Walker (a Walker original, \"Everybody's Had the Blues\"). This was followed up by a live DVD release, featuring another duet with Walker (a rendition of \"T-Bone Shuffle\").\n\n''JLW'' was released in 1994, featuring guests such as [[James Cotton]], [[Branford Marsalis]], and the [[Tower Of Power]] [[horn section]].\nDuring this period, Walker's touring schedule saw many re-appearances at the world's [[music festival]]s ([[North Sea Jazz Festival|North Sea Jazz]], [[Montreaux Jazz Festival|Montreaux]], [[Glastonbury Festival|Glastonbury]], [[San Francisco Blues Festival|San Francisco]], Russian River Jazz, [[Monterey Jazz Festival|Monterey]], New Orleans Jazz & Heritage, [[East Coast Blues & Roots Music Festival|Byron Bay]], [[Australia]], [[Notodden Blues Festival|Notodden]], [[Lucerne Festival|Lucerne]], and at the [[Beacon Theatre (New York City)|Beacon Theatre]] in [[New York City|New York]]). Walker also spent years covering all the major western television networks ([[Conan O'Brien]], Imus, [[Jools Holland]] UK, inauguration for [[George W. Bush]], inducting B.B. King for President [[Bill Clinton]] and [[Hillary Rodham Clinton]] into the [[Kennedy Centre]] Honors, ''[[Ohne Filter]]'',  Germany, Rock and Roll Hall Of Fame) as well as numerous worldwide TV networks.\n\n''Blues Of The Month Club'' was released in 1995, and was the first of three Walker albums that were co-produced with [[Steve Cropper]]. This was followed up by the release of ''Great Guitars'' in 1997. Walker's guest musicians on this release, included [[Bonnie Raitt]], [[Buddy Guy]], [[Taj Mahal (musician)|Taj Mahal]], [[Clarence \"Gatemouth\" Brown]], [[Otis Rush]], [[Scotty Moore]], [[Robert Lockwood, Jr.]], [[Matt \"Guitar\" Murphy]], [[Steve Cropper]], [[Tower Of Power]], and [[Ike Turner]].\n\nAlso in 1996, Walker played guitar on James Cotton's, ''Deep in the Blues'', a [[Grammy Award]] winner for \"Best Traditional Blues Album\". In addition, Walker won his third [[Blues Music Award]] for ''Band of the Year'' (1996) which was preceded by two similar awards for \"Contemporary Male Artist of the Year\" (1988 and 1991).  Walker also won the 1995 Bammy (Bay Area Music Award) for \"Blues Musician of the Year\". He then released ''Preacher and the President'' in 1998 and ''Silvertone Blues'' in 1999 (his sixth album for Polygram). This sequence continued with ''In The Morning'' (Telarc 2002), ''Pasa Tiempo'' (Evidence 2002), ''Guitar Brothers'' (JSP 2002), ''She's My Money Maker'' (JSP 2003), ''Ridin' High'' (Hightone 2003), ''New Direction'' (Provogue 2004) and ''Playin' Dirty'' (JSP 2006).\n\nIn 2002, he featured on the [[Bo Diddley]] tribute album, ''Hey Bo Diddley - A Tribute!'', performing the song \"[[Who Do You Love? (Bo Diddley song)|Who Do You Love?]]\".\n\nIn March 2008, Walker signed to [[Stony Plain Records]], and recorded his first album for the label in April (produced by [[Duke Robillard]]). This album featured guest appearances by Robillard and [[Todd Sharpville]], and was released in September 2008. His second album for the label was released in September 2009 entitled, ''Between A Rock and The Blues''. This album featured [[Kevin Eubanks]] as a special guest, best known for his work as the musical director for ''[[The Tonight Show with Jay Leno]]''. This album garnered five nominations in the 2010 Blues Music Awards.\n\nIn 2013, Walker was inducted to the [[Blues Hall of Fame]].<ref name=\"BHOF\">{{cite web|url=https://www.blues.org/#ref=index|title=2013 Blues Hall of Fame Inductees Announced|publisher=Blues.org|accessdate=2013-03-06}}</ref> In addition that year, Walker was nominated in four categories for a [[Blues Music Award]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://blues.org/#ref=bluesmusicawards_nominees|title=Blues Music Awards Nominees - 2013 - 34th Blues Music Awards|publisher=Blues.org|accessdate=2013-03-20}}</ref>\n\n==Discography==\n===Albums===\n*''Hornet's Nest'' ([[Alligator Records]], 2014)\n*''Hellfire'' ([[Alligator Records]], 2012)\n*''Between A Rock and The Blues'' (Stony Plain Music, 2009)\n*''Witness To The Blues'' (Stony Plain Music, 2008)\n*''Playin' Dirty'' (JSP, 2006)\n*''New Direction'' ([[Provogue]], 2004)\n*''Ridin' High'' (HighTone, 2003)\n*''She's My Money Maker'' (JSP, 2002/03)\n*''Guitar Brothers'' ([[JSP Records]], 2002)\n*''Pasa Tiempo'' ([[Evidence Music]], 2002)\n*''In the Morning'' ([[Telarc]], 2002)\n*''Silvertone Blues'' (Polydor/Polygram, 1999)\n*''Preacher and the President'' (Polydor/Polygram, 1998)\n*''[[Great Guitars]]'' (Polydor/Polygram, 1997)\n*''Blues Of The Month Club'' (Polydor/Polygram, 1995)\n*''JLW'' (Polydor/Polygram, 1994)\n*''Blues Survivor'' ([[Polydor]]/[[Polygram]], 1993)\n*''Live At Slim's, Volume Two'' (HighTone, 1992)\n*''Live At Slim's, Volume One'' (HighTone, 1991)\n*''Blue Soul'' (HighTone, 1989)\n*''The Gift'' (HighTone, 1988)\n*''Cold Is The Night'' ([[HighTone Records|HighTone]], 1986)\n\n===DVDs===\n*''Live At 'On Broadway''' (Blues Express, 2001)\n*''Joe Louis Walker in Concert'' (inakoustik, 2003)\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of blues musicians]]\n*[[West Coast blues]]\n*[[List of guitarists by genre]]\n\n==Photographs==\n{{Cleanup-gallery|date= June 2011}}\n <gallery>\nImage:jlwgeorgebush.jpg|Walker with President [[George H.
