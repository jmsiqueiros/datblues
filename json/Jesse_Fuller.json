He was sent by his mother to live with foster parents when he was a young child, in a rural setting where he was badly mistreated. Growing up, he worked a multitude of jobs: grazing cows for ten cents a day, working in a barrel factory, a broom factory, a rock quarry, on a railroad and a streetcar company, shining shoes, and even peddling hand-carved wooden snakes.<ref name=\"GoodTimeJazz\">''Jesse Fuller: San Francisco Bay Blues'', Good Time Jazz S10051, liner notes by Lester Koenig, October 19, 1963)</ref> By the age of ten he was playing guitar in two techniques, as he described it, \"frailing\" and \"picking.\"\n\nHe came west and in the 1920s he lived in Southern California, where operated a hot-dog stand and was befriended by [[Douglas Fairbanks]]. He worked briefly as a [[film]] extra in ''[[The Thief of Bagdad (1924 film)|The Thief of Bagdad]]'' and ''East of Suez''. In 1929 he settled in [[Oakland, California|Oakland]], [[California]], across the bay from [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]], where he worked for the [[Southern Pacific]] [[railroad]]. He married, and he and his wife Gertrude had a family. During [[World War II]], he worked as a [[shipyard]] [[welder]], but when the war ended he found it increasingly difficult to secure employment. Around the early 1950s, Fuller's thoughts turned toward the possibility of making a living playing music.\n\n==Start of career==\nUp to this point, Fuller had never worked as a full-time professional [[musician]], but he was an accomplished [[guitar]]ist and he had carried his guitar with him and [[busking|busked]] for money by passing the hat. He had a good memory for [[song]]s and had a large repertoire of crowd-pleasers in diverse styles, including [[country blues]], [[work song]]s, [[ragtime]] and [[jazz]] standards, [[ballad]]s, [[Spiritual (music)|spiritual]]s, and [[instrumental]]s. For a while he operated a shoe-shine stand, where he sang and danced to entertain passersby. He began to seriously compose his own songs, many of them based on his personal life experiences on the railroads, and he also set about reworking older pieces into his own [[syncopation|syncopated]] style. However, when he decided to try music as a career, he had difficulty finding reliable musicians to work with: thus his one-man band act was born, and he took on the name \"The Lone Cat\" or Jesse \"Lone Cat\" Fuller.\n\nStarting locally, in clubs and bars in San Francisco and across the bay in Oakland and [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]], Fuller became more widely known when he performed on [[television]] in both the Bay Area and Los Angeles, and in 1958 his recording career started with his first album on the Good Time Jazz [[record label]].<ref name=\"GoodTimeJazz\"/> Fuller's instruments included 6-string guitar (an instrument which he had abandoned before the beginning of his one-man band career), [[12-string guitar]], [[harmonica]], [[kazoo]], [[cymbal]] (high-hat) and [[fotdella]]. He could play several instruments simultaneously, particularly with the use of a head-piece to hold the harmonica, kazoo, and a microphone. In addition, he would generally include at least one tap dance, soft-shoe or \"buck and wing\" in his sets, accompanying himself on the 12-string guitar as he danced. His style was open and engaging, and in typical busker's fashion, he addressed his audiences as \"Ladies and Gentlemen,\" and told humorous annecdotes and cracked jokes between pieces. However, if one listened closely, the stories were anything but cheerful, often including specific recapitulations of his tragic childhood, his mother's illness and early death, his determination to escape the segregated racial system of the South, and his love of his wife and family.\n\n==The fotdella==\nThe [[fotdella]] was a [[musical instrument]] of Fuller's own creation and construction. He built at least two of them, in slightly different patterns, as evidenced in photographs and film footage of his performances.\n\nAs a [[one-man band]], Fuller's problem was how to supply a more substantial accompaniment than the typical high-hat (cymbal) or bass drum used by other street musicians. His solution, the fotdella, was a foot-operated percussion bass, consisting of a large upright wood box, shaped like the top of a double bass. Attached to a short neck at the top of this box were six [[piano]] bass strings, stretched down over the body. The means to play the strings consisted of six piano or organ foot pedals, each connected to a padded piano hammer which struck the string.<ref name=\"Mayor\">Van Ronk, Dave and Wood, Elijah. ''The Mayor of Macdougal Street'', ISBN 978-0-306-81479-2</ref>\n\nBy removing his shoe and placing his sock-covered foot in a rotating heel-cradle, Fuller was able to play the six pedals of the fotdella like a piano, and the instrument's six notes allowed him to perform varied bass lines in several keys, though he occasionally would play without it if a song exceeded its limited range.<ref name=\"Mayor\"/>\n\nThe name was coined by his wife, who took to calling the instrument a \"foot-diller\" (as in a \"killer-diller\" instrument played with the foot), which was shortened to fotdella. The term \"foot piano\" has been used by some performers and musicologists to describe this type of devise.\n\n==Death==\nFuller died in January 1976 in Oakland, California, from [[heart disease]].<ref name=\"Dead\">[http://thedeadrockstarsclub.com/1970.html Thedeadrockstarsclub.com - accessed November 2009]</ref> He was 79 years of age.
