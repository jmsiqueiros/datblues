(Bo Diddley song)|Who Do You Love?]]\" and \"House Rent Boogie/[[One Bourbon, One Scotch, One Beer]]\" by [[John Lee Hooker]] and [[Amos Milburn]] respectively.\n\nGeorge Thorogood and the Delaware Destroyers have released sixteen studio albums, including two that were [[RIAA certification|certified Platinum]], six that have been [[RIAA certification|certified Gold]], and have sold 15 million albums worldwide. The band's early success contributed to the rise of folk label [[Rounder Records]].<ref>{{cite book |title=The never-ending revival |author=Scully, Michael F. |year=2008 |publisher=University of Illinois Press |page=107}}</ref>\n\n==Early life and family==\nThorogood was born on February 24, 1950, and was raised in [[Naamans Manor, Delaware|Naamans Manor]], a neighborhood in suburban [[Wilmington, Delaware]], where his father worked for [[DuPont]]. He graduated from [[Brandywine High School]] in 1968. The singer was the middle of five children, including two older brothers, John and Pete, and two younger identical twin sisters, Liza and Anne. In the late 1970s, Thorogood played on a baseball team in Delaware in the semi-professional Roberto Clemente League, which was created in 1976. He was the second baseman and was chosen rookie of the year in the league.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} However, he turned toward music after seeing [[John P. Hammond]] perform in 1970.<ref name=amg>{{cite book |title=All music guide to the blues |author=Erlewine, Stephen Thomas |author2=Vladimir Bogdanov |author3=Chris Woodstra  |publisher=Hal Leonard Corporation |year=2003 |page=555}}</ref> His first shows were in Lane Hall at the [[University of Delaware]].<ref>{{cite web |last=Rasmussen |first=Tracy |url=http://www.delawaredestroyers.com/archives/cat_interviews.html |title=In his inimitable way, Thorogood remains thoroughly good |work=Reading Eagle | accessdate=September 27, 2013}}</ref>  By the late 1970s, success in the music industry led him to quit playing the sport and focus on music.\n\n==Music career==\nThorogood's demo, ''Better Than the Rest'', was recorded in 1974, but would not be released until 1979.  His major recording debut came in 1976 with the album: ''[[George Thorogood & The Destroyers (album)|George Thorogood & The Destroyers]],'' which was released in 1977.  His band, '''The Destroyers''' was sometimes known as '''The Delaware Destroyers''' (or simply '''GT and D''').  In 1978, Thorogood released his next album with the Destroyers titled ''[[Move It On Over (album)|Move It On Over]]'', which included the [[Hank Williams]] remake \"[[Move It On Over (song)|Move It On Over]]\". \"Please Set a Date\" and their remake of the [[Bo Diddley]] song \"[[Who Do You Love? (Bo Diddley song)|Who Do You Love?]]\" both followed in 1979.\n\nDuring the late 1970s, Thorogood and his band were based in [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]] (see also [[Hound Dog Taylor]]).  He  was friends with [[Jimmy Thackery]] of the Washington, D.C.-based blues band, [[The Nighthawks]]. While touring in the 1970s, the Destroyers and the Nighthawks happened to be playing shows in Georgetown (DC) at venues across the street from each other. The Destroyers were engaged at [[The Cellar Door]] and the Nighthawks at Desperados. At midnight, by prior arrangement, while both bands played [[Elmore James]]' \"[[Madison Blues]]\" in the same key, Thorogood and Thackery left their clubs, met in the middle of M Street, exchanged guitar patch cords and went on to play with the opposite band in the other club.<ref>''Washington Post'' Op Ed May 15, 1993 - \"M Street Shuffle\" - fact-checked correction to Weekend section feature \"Tune Town\"; May 7, 1993</ref> The connection with the Nighthawks was extended further, when Nighthawks bass player Jan Zukowski supported Thorogood's set at the [[Live Aid]] concert in Philadelphia, PA on July 13, 1985.\n\nThorogood gained his first mainstream exposure as a support act for [[The Rolling Stones]] during their 1981 U.S. tour. He also was the featured musical guest on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' (Season 8, Episode 2) on the October 2, 1982 broadcast. During this time, Thorogood and the Destroyers also became known for their rigorous touring schedule, including the \"50/50\" tour of 1981,<ref>{{cite news|last=Arar |first=Yardena |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1314&dat=19811020&id=o1ROAAAAIBAJ&sjid=d-4DAAAAIBAJ&pg=7027,2023867 |title=Thorogood will play 50 states in 50 days |newspaper=The Spokesman Review |date=October 20, 1981 |accessdate=October 27, 2013}}</ref> on which the band toured 50 [[U.S. state|US states]] in the space of 50 days.<ref name=\"WGN\">7th Inning interview on WGN Radio, June 27, 2007.</ref> After two shows in [[Boulder, Colorado]], Thorogood and his band flew to [[Hawaii]] for one show and then performed a show in [[Alaska]] on the following night.  The next day the band flew to Washington State, met their roadies who had their Checker car and a truck, and continued a one show per state tour for all fifty states in exactly fifty nights. In addition, they played [[Washington, D.C.]] on the same day that they performed a show in Maryland.\n\nThis increased visibility occurred as Thorogood's contract with Rounder Records expired. He signed with [[EMI America Records]] and in 1982 released his best-known song, \"[[Bad to the Bone]]\", and an album of the same name.  The song has been used frequently in [[television]] and [[film]], including the television drama ''[[Miami Vice]]'', the sci-fi thriller ''[[Terminator 2: Judgment Day]]'', the animated cartoon ''[[Alvin and the Chipmunks]]'', the comedies ''[[Problem Child (film)|Problem Child]]'', and ''[[Problem Child 2 (film)|Problem Child 2]]'', Stephen King's ''[[Christine (1983 film)|Christine]]'', and many episodes of the television sitcom ''[[Married... with Children]]''. This track also was used during the intro to the movie ''[[Major Payne]]'' also used in the 1988 drama film ''[[Talk Radio (film)|Talk Radio]]''. The same song is also featured in the game ''[[Rock 'n Roll Racing]]''.  It is also played during football pregame festivities at [[Mississippi State University]] and at [[USHRA Monster Jam]] events to introduce [[Grave Digger (truck)|Grave Digger]] (regardless of driver).  \"Bad to the Bone\" was used for the 1984 [[Buick Grand National]] advertisements. Thorogood's version of \"Who Do You Love?\" is played in all [[Samuel Adams beer]] commercials.\n\nIn 2012, Thorogood was named one of The 50 Most Influential Delawareans of the Past 50 Years.<ref>{{cite news|title=The 50 Most Influential Delawareans of the Past 50 Years|url=http://www.delawaretoday.com/Delaware-Today/April-2012/The-50-Most-Influential-Delawareans-of-the-Past-50-Years/|work=Delaware Today|date=March 14, 2012|accessdate=August 29, 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Band members==\n\n===The Destroyers===\n*George Thorogood \u2013 lead vocals and lead guitar\n*Jeff Simon \u2013 drums, percussion (1973\u2013present)\n*Billy Blough \u2013 bass guitar (1977\u2013present)\n*Jim Suhler \u2013 rhythm guitar (1999\u2013present)\n*Buddy Leach \u2013 saxophone, piano (2003\u2013present)\n\n===Former members===\n*Ron \"Roadblock\" Smith \u2013 rhythm guitar (1973\u20131980)\n*Hank \"Hurricane\" Carter \u2013 saxophone (1980\u20132003)\n*Steve Chrismar \u2013 rhythm guitar (1985\u20131993)\n\n==Discography==\n{{main| George Thorogood discography}}\n\n===Studio albums with the Destroyers===\n*1977: ''[[George Thorogood and the Destroyers (album)|George Thorogood and the Destroyers]]'' (Gold)\n*1978: ''[[Move It On Over (album)|Move It on Over]]'' (Gold)\n*1979: ''[[Better Than the Rest]]'' (Recorded in 1974)\n*1980: ''[[More George Thorogood and the Destroyers]]''\n*1982: ''[[Bad to the Bone (George Thorogood & The Destroyers album)|Bad to the Bone]]'' (Gold)\n*1985: ''[[Maverick (George Thorogood and the Destroyers album)|Maverick]]'' (Gold)\n*1986: ''[[Nadine (album)|Nadine]]'' (CD Rerelease of ''[[Better Than the Rest]]'')\n*1988: ''[[Born to Be Bad (album)|Born to Be Bad]]'' (Gold)\n*1991: ''[[Boogie People]]''\n*1993: ''[[Haircut (album)|Haircut]]''\n*1997: ''[[Rockin' My Life Away]]''\n*1999: ''[[Half a Boy/Half a Man]]''\n*2003: ''[[Ride 'Til I Die]]''\n*2006: ''[[The Hard Stuff]]''\n*2009: ''[[The Dirty Dozen (album)|The Dirty Dozen]]''\n*2011: ''[[2120 South Michigan Ave.]]''\n\n===Live albums===\n*1986: ''Live'' (Platinum)\n*1995: ''[[Live: Let's Work Together]]''\n*1999: ''Live in '99''\n*2004: ''[[30th Anniversary Tour: Live]]''\n*2010: ''Live in Boston 1982''\n\n===Compilations===\n*1992: ''The Baddest of George Thorogood and the Destroyers'' (Platinum)\n*2000: ''Anthology''\n*2003: ''Who Do You Love?''\n*2004: ''[[Greatest Hits: 30 Years of Rock]]'' (Gold)\n*2005: ''The Best Of George Thorogood and the Destroyers''\n*2007: ''Taking Care of Business'' (double disc of ''[[Ride 'Til I Die]]'' (w/ 2 bonus tracks) and ''30th Anniversary Tour'')\n\n==Non-musical interests==\n\n===Baseball===\nThorogood has been a [[baseball]] fan<ref name=\"WGN\"/> for most of his life, as well as playing semi-pro baseball as a second baseman during the 1970s (drummer Jeff Simon played center field on the same team).
