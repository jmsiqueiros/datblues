His band, The Matt Schofield Trio, play their own material, a blend of [[blues]], [[funk]] and [[jazz]], as well as [[cover version|covers]] of blues classics such as [[Albert Collins]]' \"Lights Are On, But Nobody's Home\".\n\n==Influences==\nSchofield's [[guitar]] playing is often likened to that of [[Robben Ford]] in its melodic and fluid style, and jazzy lines.<ref>[http://www.guitaredge.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=148:matt-schofield-blues-next-big-thing&catid=45:interviews&Itemid=66 ]{{dead link|date=December 2012}}</ref> Schofield has also been influenced, however, by [[B.B.

The first of the live discs, ''The Trio, Live'' was [[sound recording and reproduction|recorded]] at the Bishop's Blues club at The Half Moon, [[Bishop's Stortford]] in 2004 and, funded and released by Richard Pavitt on his Nugene [[record label]], gave the band their first breakthrough.<ref name=\"AMG\"/> The first studio album, ''Siftin' Thru Ashes'' was released in 2005. This album showcased Schofield as a songwriter, writing or co-writing eight out of eleven of the tracks. [[AllMusic]] called Schofield's approach \"an enjoyable demonstration of what can happen when blues-rock and blues-jazz are united\". The second live album, ''Live At The Jazz Cafe!'' was recorded at the [[The Jazz Caf\u00e9|London Jazz Cafe]] in April 2005, and was made available as a web only release. Schofield is one of only two living British artists to be given a four star (excellent) rating in the ''Penguin Book of Blues Recordings''.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}\n\nThe release of ''The Trio, Live'' prompted Schofield to be featured in a ''[[Guitarist (magazine)|Guitarist]]'' [[magazine]] article, listing the nine notable up and coming blues guitarists, Schofield being the only non-[[United States|American]]. Of the album they said \"britblues meets jazz via N'Orleans - all played with the kind of sizzling guitar that just does not often surface in Fairford, Gloucestershire\".{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}} In 2007, ''Guitar & Bass Magazine'' picked Schofield as one of the \"Top 10 British Blues Guitarists of All Time\". In August 2009, Schofield released ''Heads, Tails, & Aces'', his third studio effort. The next year (2010) the band collected the Album of the Year award at the British Blues Awards for this album.<ref name=\"BBA\">{{cite web|url=http://britishbluesawards.com |title=Home Page |publisher=British Blues Awards |date= |accessdate=2012-12-11}}</ref> Schofield won the British Blues Guitarist and Jonny Henderson won the British Keyboard Player award, and they both won these awards in 2011, too.<ref name=\"BBA\"/>\n\nIn 2011, the trio released their fourth album ''Anything but Time'', with Kevin Haynes on drums and John Porter as producer.<ref>[http://www.mattschofield.net/pagemanager/templates/news.aspx?articleid=279&zoneid=1]{{dead link|date=December 2012}}</ref> Guitarinstructor.com, a part of the Hal Leonard organization, has this album as No 5 in their top 10 albums of 2011, while ''Mojo'' magazine picked it as No 1 of Blues albums in 2011.\n\nIn 2012 Schofield made available a third [[live album]] ''Ten From The Road'', consisting of material performed live in November 2011 by Schofield with Henderson & Hayes.\n\nHe will be releasing an album called Far As I Can See in February, 2014.\n\n===Band===\nSchofield performs with an [[organ trio]] ([[guitar]], [[electric organ|organ]], and [[drum]]s).<ref name=\"AMG\"/> Organ trios are mostly associated with the 1950s and 1960s [[United States|U.S.]] [[soul jazz]] groups led by [[organist]]s such as [[Jimmy Smith (musician)|Jimmy Smith]]. Blues bands more commonly use trios of guitar, bass and drums, quartets (guitar, keyboards, bass, and drums) or quintets (guitar, rhythm guitar, keyboards, bass, and drums). In Schofield's organ trio, organist [[Jonny Henderson]] plays a [[Hammond organ]], performing basslines using his left hand, and playing chords and lead lines with his right hand. The trio's drummer is Evan Jenkins. Jeff Walker played bass on the final track of ''Siftin' Thru' Ashes''. In 2009, as of the recording of ''Heads, Tails & Aces'', The Matt Schofield Trio became The Matt Schofield Band, a four-piece, featuring Jeff 'The Funk' Walker on bass, and also replacing Evan Jenkins with Alain Baudry. At a concert at the Swindon Arts Centre<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.swindon.gov.uk/artscentre |title=Arts Centre - Swindon Borough Council |publisher=Swindon.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-12-11}}</ref> on 22 October 2009, the band reverted to a trio. In June 2010, Kevin Hayes, replaced Evan Jenkins in the band. The 2012 Europe Tour, the trio was back with its original formation, with Matt Schofield, Evan Jenkins and Jonny Henderson.\n\n==Discography==\n{{list to table|date=November 2012}}\n*2004: ''The Trio, Live'' (NUG601)\n:Uncle Junior\n:Everyday I Have The Blues\n:Bloody Murder\n:Treat Me Lowdown\n:Cissy Strut\n:Travellin' South\n:Sittin' On Top Of The World\n:Hippology\n*2005: ''Live at the Jazz Caf\u00e9'' (NUG503)\n:All You Need\n:Uncle Junior\n:Lights Are On, But Nobody's Home\n:Travellin' South\n:Cissy Strut\n:On My Way\n:It's Your Thing\n*2005: ''Siftin' Thru' Ashes'' (NUG501)\n:All You Need\n:Siftin' Thru Ashes\n:Djam\n:Lights Are On, But Nobody's Home\n:The Letter\n:Back At Square One\n:People Say\n:How I Try\n:On My Way\n:Middle Ground\n:Hard Lines\n*2007: ''Ear To The Ground''\n:Pack it Up\n:Troublemaker\n:Ear to the Ground\n:Heart Don't Need a Compass\n:Once in a While\n:Room at the Back\n:Someone\n:Searchin'\n:Move Along\n:Cookie Jar\n:When it all Comes Down\n*2009: ''Heads, Tails & Aces''\n:What I Wanna Hear\n:Live Wire\n:War We Wage\n:Betting Man\n:Lay It Down\n:Can't Put You Down\n:Woman Across the River\n:Nothing Left\n:I Told Ya\n:Stranger Blues\n:Not Raining Now\n*2011: ''Anything But Time''\n:Anything But Time\n:See Me Through\n:At Times We Do Forget\n:Shipwrecked\n:Dreaming of You\n:Wrapped Up in Love\n:Where Do I Have to Stand\n:One Look (and I'm Hooked)\n:Don't Know What I'd Do\n:Share Our Smile Again\n*2012: ''Ten From The Road''\n:Ear To The Ground\n:Don't Know What I'd Do\n:Live Wire\n:Where Do I Have To Stand\n:Anything But Time\n:Dreaming Of You\n:Shipwrecked\n:See Me Through\n:Siftin' Thru Ashes\n:Not Raining Now\n*2014: ''Far As I Can See''\n:From Far Away\n:Clean Break\n:Getaway\n:Breaking Up Somebody's Home\n:The Day You Left\n:Oakville Shuffle\n:Hindsight\n:Everything\n:Yellow Moon\n:Tell Me Some Lies\n:Red Dragon\n\n\n*Other albums featuring Matt Schofield\n**''Swagger'' - [[Ian Siegal]] - [[record producer|produced]] by Schofield\n**''Meat And Potatoes'' - Ian Siegal - co-produced by Schofield\n**''My Day Is Just Beginning'' - The Lee Sankey Group\n**''She's Not Alone'' - The Lee Sankey Group\n**''Two Timing Lover Boy'' - Dino Baptiste\n**''A Different Picture'' - Earl Green\n**''Driving Savage Groove'' - Harmonica Posse\n**''Staying Power'' - [[Dana Gillespie]]\n**''Experienced'' - Dana Gillespie\n**''Songs Of Love'' - Dana Gillespie\n**''Back To Blues'' - Dana Gillespie\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.mattschofield.com Matt Schofield official website]\n*[http://www.nugenerecords.com Nugene Records]\n*[http://britishbluesawards.com/# British Blues Awards]\n\n{{Persondata <!-- Metadata: see [[Wikipedia:Persondata]]. -->\n| NAME              = Schofield, Matt\n| ALTERNATIVE NAMES =\n| SHORT DESCRIPTION = [[English people|English]] [[blues]] guitarist and singer\n| DATE OF BIRTH     = 21 August 1977\n| PLACE OF BIRTH    = [[Manchester]], [[England]]\n| DATE OF DEATH     =\n| PLACE OF DEATH    =\n}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Schofield, Matt}}\n[[Category:1977 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:English blues guitarists]]\n[[Category:English blues musicians]]\n[[Category:English blues singers]]\n[[Category:Blues rock musicians]]"}]}}}}
