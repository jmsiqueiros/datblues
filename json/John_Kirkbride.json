His performances are characterized by audience participation and storytelling, especially funny or critical asides and anecdotes, often accompanied by authentic blues music.\n\n==Life and career==\nAt the age of eight, Kirkbride emigrated with his family from [[Scotland]] to [[Queensland]], Australia.<ref>[http://john-kirkbride.com/sites/blues_home_english.htm Emigrating to Australia, ''www.john-kirkbride.com'']</ref> He was fascinated by his first guitar and learned to play it by him, without hasenting afraid of anything. He tuned his guitar on only one chord, not realising that the first generation of blues singers in the [[Mississippi Delta]] also tuned their guitars on a single chord for playing [[slide guitar|slide or bottleneck guitar]] (a technique called [[open tuning]]). Only years later would Kirkbride learn about the conventional tuning of a guitar.\n\nInfluenced by songwriters like [[Carole King]], [[Joni Mitchell]], [[Randy Newman]], [[Neil Young]], and [[Leonard Cohen]], Kirkbride began to compose his own material. He was interested in the dialogue between text and music to this day, and texts, especially those with a critical and political point view, continue to be an important element of his musical style.\n\nKirkbride served in the British [[Royal Air Force]] as a fighter pilot (and claims he was shot above [[Yemen]], according to his statement). He settled in [[New York City]] in the late 1960s, intending to earn a living from his music. This turned out to be difficult, but his stay in the US gave him an opportunity to improve his technique and musical knowledge.\n\nWhile in the US, Kirkbride performed with [[Pete Seeger]], [[Lightnin' Hopkins]], [[B.B. King]], [[Eric Clapton]], [[John Mayall]], [[Louisiana Red]], [[Alexis Korner]], [[Chuck Leavell]], [[Albie Donnelly]], and other prominent musicians. During a sojourn in the [[Netherlands]] in 1976, Kirkbride began to enrich blues songs with melody and harmonics, particularly the compositions of [[Robert Johnson (musician)|Robert Johnson]], whom Kirkbride admires more than any other musician.\n\nKirkbride moved to Germany, where he still lives today. He has worked for many years with the German author [[Hans-Christian Kirsch]], whose lectures he has accompanied with classical or Celtic music, blues or jazz, according to the programme. He also performs (among others) with the [[Bavaria]]n [[blues harp]] player Ferdl Eichner, with whom he has made numerous records.\n\n==Discography==\n\n===Albums===\n* ''Tracks''\n* ''Magnetic Mugshots of Memorable Moments''\n* ''Sourdough, Corn and Hot Biscuits''\n* ''Reds and Blues''\n* ''Blue Images''\n* ''Street Kids''\n* ''Brotherhood in Blues'' (with Ferdl Eichner)\n* ''Adam und Eva'' (with Hans-Christian Kirsch)\n* ''Der Keltische Zauberspiegel'' (with Hans-Christian Kirsch)\n* ''Riches to Rags'' (with Ferdl Eichner)\n* ''Changing of the Ways''\n* ''Return Cargo'' (with Albie Donnelly)\n* ''Sketches''\n* ''Lifeline'' (with Ferdl Eichner) 2009\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* http://www.madhouse-augsburg.de/veranstaltungen/archiv/kirkbridge.php\n* http://www.folkclub.de/bands/kirkbride/index.html\n* [http://john-kirkbride.com/sites/blues_home_english.htm Official website]\n* [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yTP2-fwc10&feature=related Kirkbride on youtube.com]\n\n{{Authority control|VIAF=199259006}}\n\n{{Persondata <!-- Metadata: see [[Wikipedia:Persondata]]. -->\n| NAME              =Kirkbride, John\n| ALTERNATIVE NAMES =\n| SHORT DESCRIPTION = British musician\n| DATE OF BIRTH     = 17 February 1946\n| PLACE OF BIRTH    =\n| DATE OF DEATH     =\n| PLACE OF DEATH    =\n}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Kirkbride, John}}\n[[Category:Scottish guitarists]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:1946 births]]\n[[Category:Slide guitarists]]\n[[Category:British blues guitarists]]"}]}}}}
