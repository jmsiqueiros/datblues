He is known by the nickname \"The Killer\" and is often viewed as \"rock & roll's first great wild man.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Bogdanov|first=Vladimir|title=All Music Guide: The Definitive Guide to Popular Music|year=2001|publisher=Backbeat Books|location=San Francisco|page=234}}</ref>\n\nAn early pioneer of rock and roll music, in 1956 Lewis made his first recordings at Sun Records. \"[[Crazy Arms]]\" sold 300,000 copies in the South, but it was his 1957 hit \"[[Whole Lotta Shakin' Going On]]\" that shot Lewis to fame worldwide. Lewis followed this when he recorded songs such as \"[[Great Balls of Fire]]\", \"[[Breathless (Jerry Lee Lewis song)|Breathless]]\" and \"[[High School Confidential (Jerry Lee Lewis song)|High School Confidential]]\". However, Lewis's rock and roll career faltered in the wake of his marriage to his 13-year-old cousin when he was 22.\n\nHe had little success in the charts following the scandal and his popularity quickly faded. His live performance fees plummeted from $10,000 per night to $250. In the meantime he was determined to gain back some of his popularity. During the early 1960s he didn't have much chart success with few exceptions such as \"[[What'd I Say]]\". His live performances at this time were increasingly wild and energetic. His album ''[[Live at the Star Club, Hamburg]]'' from 1964 is often regarded by many music journalists and fans as one of the wildest and greatest rock and roll concert albums ever. After recording songs such as \"I'm on Fire\" for several years with little success, in 1968 Lewis made a transition into country music and had hits with songs such as \"Another Place, Another Time\". This reignited his career and throughout the late 1960s and 1970s he regularly topped the country-western charts. His No. 1 country hits included \"[[To Make Love Sweeter For You]]\", \"[[There Must Be More to Love Than This]]\", \"[[Would You Take Another Chance on Me]]\" and \"[[Me And Bobby McGee]]\".\n\nLewis's successes continued throughout the decade and he embraced his rock and roll past with songs such as a cover of the [[Big Bopper|Big Bopper's]] \"[[Chantilly Lace]]\" and \"[[Rockin' My Life Away]]\". In the 21st century Lewis continues to tour to audiences around the world and still releases new albums. One such album, titled ''[[Last Man Standing (Jerry Lee Lewis album)|Last Man Standing]]'', is his best selling to date at over a million copies sold worldwide. This was followed by ''[[Mean Old Man (album)|Mean Old Man]]'', which has received some of the best sales of Lewis's career.\n\nLewis has had a dozen gold records in both rock and country, won several Grammy awards, including a Lifetime Achievement Award. Lewis was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 1986, and his pioneering contribution to the genre has been recognized by the [[Rockabilly Hall of Fame]]. In 1989, his life was chronicled in the movie ''[[Great Balls of Fire! (film)|Great Balls of Fire]]'', starring Dennis Quaid. In 2003, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' listed his box set ''[[All Killer, No Filler: The Anthology]]'' number 242 on their list of \"[[Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time|500 Greatest Albums of All Time]]\".<ref>[http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/jerryleelewis/articles/story/6599768/242_all_killer_no_filler All Killer, No Filler!] [[Rolling Stone Magazine]] online.

His parents [[Mortgage loan|mortgaged]] their farm to buy him a piano. Influenced by a piano-playing older cousin, [[Carl McVoy]] (who later recorded with [[Bill Black]]'s Combo), the radio, and the sounds from the black [[juke joint]] across the tracks called Haney's Big House,<ref>[http://www.underthehillsaloon.com/custom/webpage.cfm?content=newsletter&id=50 Natchez Under The Hill Saloon \u2013 Natchez Mississippi].

Retrieved on 2011-07-15.</ref>\n\nHis mother enrolled him in [[Southwestern Assemblies of God University|Southwest Bible Institute]] in [[Waxahachie, Texas]], so that her son would be exclusively singing his evangelical songs. But Lewis daringly played a boogie woogie rendition of \"My God Is Real\" at a church assembly that sent him packing the same night. Pearry Green, then president of the student body, related how during a talent show, Lewis played some \"worldly\" music. The next morning, the [[Dean (education)|dean]] of the school called Lewis and Green into his office to expel them. Lewis said that Green should not be expelled because \"he didn't know what I was going to do.\" Years later Green asked Lewis: \"Are you still playing the devil's music?\" Lewis replied \"Yes, I am. But you know it's strange, the same music that they kicked me out of school for is the same kind of music they play in their churches today. The difference is, I know I am playing for the devil and they don't.\"\n\nAfter that incident, he went home and started playing at clubs in and around Ferriday and [[Natchez, Mississippi]], becoming part of the burgeoning new rock and roll sound and cutting his first demo recording in 1954. He made a trip to [[Nashville]] circa 1955 where he played clubs and attempted to build interest, but was turned down by the [[Grand Ole Opry]], as he had been at the [[Louisiana Hayride]] country stage and radio show in Shreveport. Recording executives in Nashville suggested he switch to playing a guitar.\n\n===Sun Records===\nIn November 1956, Lewis traveled to [[Memphis, Tennessee]], to audition for [[Sun Records]]. Label owner [[Sam Phillips]] was in Florida, but producer and engineer [[Jack Clement]] recorded Lewis's rendition of [[Ray Price (musician)|Ray Price]]'s \"[[Crazy Arms]]\" and his own composition \"End of The Road\". During December 1956, Lewis began recording prolifically, as a solo artist and as a [[session musician]] for such Sun artists as [[Carl Perkins]] and [[Johnny Cash]]. His distinctive piano can be heard on many tracks recorded at Sun during late 1956 and early 1957, including Carl Perkins's \"[[Matchbox (song)|Matchbox]]\", \"Your True Love\", \"You Can Do No Wrong\", and \"Put Your Cat Clothes On\", and [[Billy Lee Riley]]'s \"Flyin' Saucers Rock'n'Roll\". Formerly, [[rockabilly]] had rarely featured piano, but it proved an influential addition and rockabilly artists on other labels also started working with pianists.\n[[File:Jerry Lee Lewis 1950s.JPG|thumb|upright|left|Lewis in the 1950s]]\n\nOn December 4, 1956, [[Elvis Presley]] dropped in on Phillips to pay a social visit while Perkins was in the studio cutting new tracks with Lewis backing him on piano. Johnny Cash was also there watching Perkins. The four then started an impromptu [[jam session]], and Phillips left the tape running.<ref name=pc8/> These recordings, almost half of which were gospel songs, survived, and have been released on CD under the title ''[[Million Dollar Quartet]]''. Tracks also include Elvis Presley's \"[[Don't Be Cruel]]\" and \"Paralyzed\", [[Chuck Berry]]'s \"[[Brown Eyed Handsome Man]]\", [[Pat Boone]]'s \"Don't Forbid Me\" and Presley doing an impersonation of [[Jackie Wilson]] (who was then with [[Billy Ward and the Dominoes]]) on \"Don't Be Cruel\".\n\nLewis's own singles (on which he was billed as \"Jerry Lee Lewis and his Pumping Piano\") advanced his career as a soloist during 1957, with hits such as \"[[Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin' On]]\" and \"[[Great Balls of Fire]]\", his biggest hit, bringing him international fame, despite criticism for the songs' overtly sexual undertones which prompted some radio stations to boycott them. In 2005, \"Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin' On\" was selected for permanent preservation in the [[National Recording Registry]] at the Library of Congress.\n\nAccording to several first-hand sources, including [[Johnny Cash]], Lewis himself, who was devoutly Christian, was also troubled by the sinful nature of his own material, which he firmly believed was leading him and his audience to hell.<ref>Johnny Cash, ''[[Cash: The Autobiography]]'', 1997, p. 98.</ref>  This aspect of Lewis's character was depicted in [[Waylon Payne]]'s portrayal of Lewis in the 2005 film ''[[Walk the Line]]'', based on Cash's autobiographies.\n\nAs part of his stage act, Lewis would often kick the piano bench aside and play standing, rake his hands up and down the keyboard for dramatic accent, sit on the keyboard and even stand on top of the instrument.  Lewis told ''the [[Pop Chronicles]]'' that kicking over the bench originally happened by accident, but when it got a favorable response, he kept it in the act.<ref name=pc8>{{Gilliland |url=http://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc19756/m1/ |title=Show 8 - The All American Boy: Enter Elvis and the rock-a-billies.

I'd like to have got away with it, though. I pushed a couple of them in the river. They wasn't any good.\"\n\nHis dynamic performance style can be seen in films such as ''[[High School Confidential (film)|High School Confidential]]'' (he sang the title song from the back of a flatbed truck), and ''[[Jamboree (1957 film)|Jamboree]]''. He has been called \"rock & roll's first great wild man\" and also \"rock & roll's first great eclectic\".<ref>[{{Allmusic|class=album|id=r78332|pure_url=yes}} AllMusic review: ''Live at the Star Club'']</ref> Classical composer [[Michael Nyman]] has also cited Lewis's style as the progenitor of his own aesthetic.<ref>[[Andrew Ford (composer)|Andrew Ford]]. \"Jerry Lee Lewis Plays Mozart\".

She was Lewis's <!-- DO NOT CHANGE COUSIN STATEMENT - SEE TALK PAGE --> [[Cousin chart|first cousin once removed]],<ref>[http://jerry9.tripod.com/Myra.htm Myra Lewis-Williams Interview], Jerry9.tripod.com (1998-04-17).

Lewis was 22 years old. The publicity caused an uproar and the tour was cancelled after only three concerts.\n\nThe scandal followed Lewis home to the U.S. and, as a result, he was [[blacklist]]ed from radio and almost vanished from the music scene. Lewis felt betrayed by numerous people who had been his supporters. [[Dick Clark]] dropped him from his shows. Lewis even felt that [[Sam Phillips]] had sold him out when the Sun Records boss released \"The Return of Jerry Lee\", a bogus \"interview\" cut together by [[Jack Clement]] from excerpts of Lewis's songs that \"answered\" the interview questions, which made light of his marital and publicity problems. Only [[Alan Freed]] stayed true to Lewis, playing his records until Freed was removed from the air because of [[payola]] allegations.\n\nLewis was still under contract with Sun Records, and kept recording, regularly releasing singles. He had gone from $10,000 a night concerts to $250 a night spots in beer joints and small clubs. He had few friends at the time whom he felt he could trust. It was only through Kay Martin, the president of Lewis's fan club, T. L. Meade (aka [[Franz Douskey]]), a sometime [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]] musician and friend of Sam Phillips, and Gary Skala, that Lewis went back to record at Sun Records.{{When|date=October 2009}}\n\nBy this time,{{When|date=October 2009}} Phillips had built a new state-of-the-art studio at 639 Madison Avenue in Memphis, thus abandoning the old Union Avenue studio where Phillips had recorded [[B.B. King]], [[Howlin\u2019 Wolf]], [[Elvis Presley]], [[Roy Orbison]], [[Carl Perkins]], Lewis, [[Johnny Cash]] and others, and also opened a studio in Nashville. It was at the latter studio that Lewis recorded his only major hit during this period, a rendition of [[Ray Charles]]' \"[[What'd I Say (song)|What'd I Say]]\" in 1961. In Europe, other updated versions of \"[[Sweet Little Sixteen]]\" (September 1962 UK) and \"[[Good Golly Miss Molly]]\" (March 1963) entered the Hit Parade. On popular EPs, \"Hang Up My Rock and Roll Shoes\", \"I've Been Twistin'\", \"Money\" and \"Hello Josephine\" also became turntable hits, especially in nascent [[discoth\u00e8que]]s. Another recording of Lewis playing an instrumental boogie arrangement of the [[Glenn Miller Orchestra]] favorite \"[[In the Mood]]\" was issued on the Phillips International label under the [[pseudonym]] \"The Hawk\", but disc jockeys quickly figured out the distinctive piano style, and this gambit failed.\n\nLewis's Sun recording contract ended in 1963 and he joined Smash Records, where he made a number of rock recordings that did not further his career.\n\nHis popularity recovered somewhat in Europe, especially in the UK and Germany, during the mid-1960s. A concert album, ''[[Live at the Star Club, Hamburg]]'' (1964), recorded with [[The Nashville Teens]], is widely considered one of the greatest live rock-and-roll albums ever.<ref name = \"Checksfield\">Peter Checksfield, \"Jerry Lee Lewis.

It lasted for four years, from September 1953 to October 1957. The couple had two children: Jerry Lee Lewis Jr. (1954\u20131973) and Ronnie Guy Lewis (b. 1956).\n\nHis third marriage, to his cousin Myra Gale Brown, lasted for 13 years, from December 1957 to December 1970 (although the couple went through a second marriage ceremony because his divorce from Jane Mitchum was not complete before the first ceremony took place). They had two children together: Steve Allen Lewis (1959\u20131962) and Phoebe Allen Lewis (b. 1963).\n\nHis fourth marriage, to Jaren Elizabeth Gunn Pate, lasted from October 1971 to June 8, 1982, producing one child, a daughter, Lori Lee Lewis (b. 1972), and ending several weeks before divorce proceedings could be finalized when Pate drowned in a swimming pool at the home of a friend with whom she was staying.<ref>{{cite news|title=Lewis' Wife Dies in Pool|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=PTMdAAAAIBAJ&sjid=f6UEAAAAIBAJ&pg=4215,2121527&dq=jaren-pate+jerry-lee-lewis+pool&hl=en|accessdate=August 16, 2012|newspaper=The Tuscaloosa News|date=June 10, 1982}}</ref>\n\nHis fifth marriage, to Shawn Stephens, lasted 77 days, from June to August 1983, ending with her death.<ref>{{cite news|title=Jerry's Bride Dies|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=HdFAAAAAIBAJ&sjid=mKYMAAAAIBAJ&pg=6536,4647594&dq=shawn-stephens+jerry-lee-lewis&hl=en|accessdate=August 16, 2012|newspaper=Evening Times|location=Glasgow|date=August 25, 1983|page=3}}</ref> It has been alleged that Lewis abused her and was responsible for her death.<ref>{{cite news|title=BGS: The Strange and Mysterious Death of Mrs. Jerry Lee Lewis|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/01/11/the-strange-and-mysterious-death-of-mrs-jerry-lee-lewis.html}}</ref>\n\nHis sixth marriage, to Kerrie McCarver, lasted 20 years, from 1984 to 2004.

In 1968, his single \"Another Place, Another Time\" became a Top 10 success and led to a string of Top Ten singles including the 1968 number-one country single \"To Make Love Sweeter For You\" that brought Lewis renewed stardom among country music fans, much like that which ex-rockabilly [[Conway Twitty]] began to cultivate during that same time. His shift to country reflected the fact that he had grown up listening to [[the Grand Ole Opry]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}  Lewis's country hits during this period include \"[[What's Made Milwaukee Famous (Has Made a Loser Out of Me)]]\"; \"She Still Comes Around (To Love What's Left of Me)\"; \"[[She Even Woke Me Up to Say Goodbye]]\"; \"Once More With Feeling\"; \"[[There Must Be More to Love Than This]]\"; \"Touching Home\"; \"[[Would You Take Another Chance on Me]]\"; \"[[Me & Bobby McGee]]\"; \"Think About It, Darlin'\"; \"Sometimes a Memory Ain't Enough\"; and \"Tell Tale Signs\". Lewis's singles and albums were issued on Mercury records after the Smash label was discontinued in 1970. Lewis's renewed popularity encouraged Sun International Inc. to issue previously unpublished recordings dating from 1963 including \"[[Invitation to Your Party]]\", \"One Minute Past Eternity\", \"I Can't Seem To Say Goodbye\" and \"Waiting For A Train\" on singles that also did well on the country music charts in 1969/70. Lewis's successes continued throughout the decade and he eventually began to re-emphasize his rock-and-roll past with hits like his 1972 revival of [[The Big Bopper]]'s rock classic \"[[Chantilly Lace (song)|Chantilly Lace]]\" and \"Drinkin' Wine Spo-dee-o dee\", as well as looking at middle age with the 1977 \"Middle Age Crazy\". In 1979, he signed with Elektra Records and had his last major country hit with 1981's \"Thirty-Nine and Holding\". He spent a very brief period with [[MCA Records]] in 1983, but left the label due to unspecified differences.\n\nIn 1989, a major motion picture based on his early life in rock & roll, ''[[Great Balls of Fire! (film)|Great Balls of Fire!]]'', brought him back into the public eye, especially when he decided to re-record all his songs for the movie soundtrack. The film was based on the book by Lewis's ex-wife, Myra Gale Lewis, and starred [[Dennis Quaid]] as Lewis, [[Winona Ryder]] as Myra, and [[Alec Baldwin]] as Jimmy Swaggart. The movie focuses on Lewis's early career and his relationship with Myra, and ends with the scandal of the late 1950s. A year later, in 1990, Lewis made minor news when a new song he co-wrote called \"It Was the Whiskey Talkin' (Not Me)\" was included in the soundtrack to the hit movie ''[[Dick Tracy]]''. The song is also heard in the movie, playing on a radio.\n\nThe public downfall of his cousin, television evangelist [[Jimmy Swaggart]], resulted in more adverse publicity to a troubled family. Swaggart is also a piano player, as is another cousin, country music star [[Mickey Gilley]]. All three listened to the same music in their youth, and frequented Haney's Big House, the Ferriday club that featured black blues acts. Lewis and Swaggart have had a complex relationship over the years.\n\n[[File:Linda Gail Lewis 1977.jpg|thumb|left|[[Linda Gail Lewis]], touring with her brother, in 1977, in Ludwigshafen, Germany]]\nLewis's sister, [[Linda Gail Lewis]], has recorded with Lewis, toured with his stage show for a time and more recently recorded with [[Van Morrison]].\n\n\"The Killer\", a nickname Lewis has had since childhood, is known for his forceful voice and piano play on stage.

That year, he returned to Sun Studio in Memphis to team up with Orbison, Cash, and Perkins along with longtime admirers like [[John Fogerty]] to create the album ''[[Class of '55]]'', a sort of followup to the \"Million Dollar Quartet\" session, though in the eyes of many critics and fans, lacking the spirit of the old days at Sun.\n\nIn 1998, he toured Europe with [[Chuck Berry]] and [[Little Richard]]. On February 12, 2005, he was given a [[Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award|Lifetime Achievement Award]] by [[National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences|The Recording Academy]] (which also grants the [[Grammy Awards]]). On September 26, 2006, a new album titled ''[[Last Man Standing (Jerry Lee Lewis album)|Last Man Standing]]'' was released, featuring many of rock and roll's elite as guest stars. Receiving positive reviews, the album charted in four different Billboard charts, including a two-week stay at number one on the Indie charts.\n\nA DVD entitled ''[[Last Man Standing Live]]'', featuring concert footage with many guest artists, was released in March 2007, and the CD achieved Lewis's 10th official gold disk for selling over half-a-million copies in the US alone. ''Last Man Standing'' is Lewis's biggest selling album of all time.
