While still in his [[adolescence|teens]] he teamed up with the [[slide guitar]]ist and [[singer|vocalist]], B.K. Turner aka [[Black Ace]] and the pair travelled together playing the turpentine and logging camp circuit of country dance halls and juke joints that surrounded [[Kilgore, Texas|Kilgore]], [[Tyler, Texas|Tyler]], [[Greenville, Texas|Greenville]] and [[Palestine, Texas|Palestine]] in [[East Texas]].\n\nIn 1937 Smokey and Black Ace were brought to [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]] by [[Decca Records]] to [[sound recording and reproduction|record]], and Smokey had his first [[gramophone record]] (\"Family Trouble Blues\"/\"Kind Hearted Blues\") released, as by Andrew Hogg. It was an isolated occurrence - he did not make it back into a [[recording studio]] for over a decade.<ref name=\"amg\"/> By the early 1940s Hogg was married and making a good living [[busking]] around the [[Deep Ellum, Dallas, Texas|Deep Ellum]] area of [[Dallas, Texas]].\n\nHogg was [[Conscription in the United States|drafted]] in the mid-1940s and after a brief spell with the [[United States|U.S.]] military, he continued working in the Dallas area where he was becoming well known. In 1947 he came to the attention of Herbert T. Rippa Sr, boss of the Dallas based [[record label]], Bluebonnet Records, who recorded several sides with him and leased the masters to [[Modern Records]].\n\nThe first release on Modern was the [[Big Bill Broonzy]] [[song]] \"Too Many Drivers\", and this racked up sufficient sales to encourage Modern Records to bring Hogg out to [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], [[California]] to cut more sides with their team of [[recording studio|studio]] [[session musician|musicians]]. These songs included his two biggest [[hit record|hits]], \"Long Tall Mama\" in 1949 and another Broonzy tune \"[[Good Morning, School Girl|Little School Girl]]\" (#9 U.S. [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs|R&B]]  [[record chart|chart]]) in 1950.\n\nHis two-part \"Penitentiary Blues\" (1952) was a remake of the prison song, \"Ain't No More Cane on the Brazos\".<ref name=\"russell\">{{cite book\n| first= Tony\n| last= Russell\n| year= 1997\n| title= The Blues: From Robert Johnson to Robert Cray\n| edition= \n| publisher= Carlton Books Limited \n| location= Dubai\n| pages= 117\u201318\n| isbn= 1-85868-255-X}}</ref>\n\nHogg's country blues style, influenced by Broonzy, [[Peetie Wheatstraw]] and Black Ace was popular with record buyers in the [[Southern United States|South]] during the late 1940s and early 1950s. He continued to work and record until the end of the 1950s, but died of [[cancer]], or possibly a ruptured [[Peptic ulcer|ulcer]], in [[McKinney, Texas]] in 1960.<ref>[http://www.thedeadrockstarsclub.com/1960.html Dead Rock Stars Club website - accessed January 2008]</ref>\n\n==Relations and confusion==\nSmokey's [[cousin]], John Hogg, also played the blues, recording for [[Mercury Records|Mercury]] in 1951.\n\nSmokey was reputed to be a cousin of [[Lightnin' Hopkins]], and distantly related to [[Alger \"Texas\" Alexander]], although both claims are ambiguous.<ref>[http://www.thebluestrail.com/artists/mus_hogg.htm The Bluestrail.com website information]</ref> \n\nHe is not to be confused with Willie \"Smokey\" Hogg, a [[New York City|New York]] based musician of the 1960s with a similar name.<ref name=\"amg\"/>\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of blues musicians]]\n*[[List of Texas blues musicians]]\n*[[List of Electric blues musicians]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.wirz.de/music/hogg.htm Illustrated Smokey Hogg discography]\n\n{{Authority control|VIAF=201002}}\n{{Persondata <!-- Metadata: see [[Wikipedia:Persondata]]. -->\n| NAME              = Hogg, Andrew\n| ALTERNATIVE NAMES = Hogg, Smokey\n| SHORT DESCRIPTION = [[United States|American]] [[post-war]] [[Texas blues|Texas]] and [[country blues]] [[musician]]\n| DATE OF BIRTH     = January 27, 1914\n| PLACE OF BIRTH    = Westconnie, [[Texas]], [[United States]]\n| DATE OF DEATH     = May 1, 1960\n| PLACE OF DEATH    = [[McKinney, Texas]], United States\n}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Hogg, Smokey}}\n[[Category:American buskers]]\n[[Category:American country singers]]\n[[Category:American blues musicians]]\n[[Category:Electric blues musicians]]\n[[Category:Texas blues musicians]]\n[[Category:1914 births]]\n[[Category:1960 deaths]]\n[[Category:Imperial Records artists]]\n[[Category:Modern Records artists]]\n[[Category:Specialty Records artists]]\n[[Category:Combo Records artists]]"}]}}}}
