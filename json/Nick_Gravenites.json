Nick wrote various songs for Joplin, including her Woodstock hit [[Work Me, Lord]] and the unfinished instrumental track \"Buried Alive In The Blues\". Gravenites also worked extensively with [[John Cipollina]] after producing the first [[Quicksilver Messenger Service]] album. He and Cipollina formed the Nick Gravenites\u2013John Cipollina Band which toured a lot in Europe.\n\nWhen the band Big Brother and the Holding Company reformed from 1969 to 1972 (without Janis Joplin), Nick was the lead singer.\n\nGravenites was also a songwriter for the [[Paul Butterfield|Paul Butterfield Blues Band]], which consisted of [[Elvin Bishop]], [[Paul Butterfield]], [[Sam Lay]] and [[Mike Bloomfield|Michael Bloomfield]], then formed [[The Electric Flag]] with Butterfield guitarist [[Mike Bloomfield]]. Gravenites is also responsible for writing the score for ''[[The Trip (1967 film)|The Trip]]'', produced the music for the movie ''[[Steelyard Blues]]''. He produced the pop hit \"[[One Toke Over the Line]]\" for [[Brewer & Shipley]] and the album ''[[Right Place, Wrong Time (album)|Right Place, Wrong Time]]'' for [[Otis Rush]], for which he was nominated for a [[Grammy Award]]. Together with [[John Kahn]], Gravenites produced the album 'Not mellowed with Age' by Southern Comfort (CBS S 64125 - 1970). Over the years, Gravenites would often use pianist [[Pete Sears]] in his band \"Animal Mind\", including on his 1980 Blue Star album on which Sears played keyboards and bass. \n\nIn the early '80s, Gravenites performed and recorded with a revolving group of SF Bay Area rock, blues, and soul musicians called The Usual Suspects. Their first album, \"The Usual Suspects,\" released in 1981, included Gravenites on vocals along with Mike Bloomfield, Pete Sears, Taj Mahal, Darol Anger, Peter Rowan, Mark Naftalin, Anna Rizzo, Ron Thompson, and others. \n\nGravenites and Sears played together in front of 100,000 people on Earth Day 1990 at Crissy Field, San Francisco. Sears also joined him for a tour of Greece.\n\nHe still performs live in northern California. Gravenites was inducted to the [[Blues Hall of Fame]] in 2003 for his song \"Born In Chicago\". He recently toured with the Chicago Blues Reunion and a new Electric Flag Band. \n\nNick is featured in a documentary film entitled \"Born In Chicago\" where he and several other Chicago natives tell their story of growing up with blues music in Chicago. The film was shown at the SXSW festival in Austin, TX in 2013 and is appearing at various film festivals around the west coast.\n\n==Discography==\n===Albums===\n* 1968 ''Long Time Comin''' The Electric Flag\n* 1969 ''My Labors''\n* 1970 ''[[Be a Brother|Be A Brother]]'' Big Brother and the Holding Company\n* 1972 ''Joplin In Concert''\n* 1973 ''Steelyard Blues OST''\n* 1980 ''Blue Star'' (Line Records)\n* 1981 ''The Usual Suspects''\n* 1982 ''Monkey Medicine'' The Nick Gravenites John Cipollina Band\n* 1991 ''Live At The Rodon'' Nick Gravenites and John Cipollina (Music Box)\n* 1996 ''Don't Feed The Animals''\n* 1999 ''Kill My Brain''\n* 2005 ''Buried Alive In The Blues'' (live)\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2838918/ Born In Chicago IMDb]\n*[https://www.facebook.com/BornInChicagoMovie Born In Chicago Facebook]\n*[http://www.nickgravenites.com Official Nick Gravenites Website]\n*[http://www.cbrband.com Chicago Blues Reunion Band official site]\n*[http://www.bay-area-bands.com/bab00010.htm 1994 Interview]\n*[http://www.bluespower.com/a-ngbtb.htm Autobiography]\n{{Big Brother and the Holding Company}}\n{{Authority control|VIAF=46944817}}\n{{Persondata <!-- Metadata: see [[Wikipedia:Persondata]]. -->\n| NAME              =Gravenites, Nick\n| ALTERNATIVE NAMES =\n| SHORT DESCRIPTION = American musician\n| DATE OF BIRTH     =1938-10-02\n| PLACE OF BIRTH    = [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]], [[United States]]\n| DATE OF DEATH     =\n| PLACE OF DEATH    =\n}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Gravenites, Nick}}\n[[Category:1938 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:Songwriters from Illinois]]\n[[Category:American singer-songwriters]]\n[[Category:American rock singers]]\n[[Category:American blues singers]]\n[[Category:Musicians from Chicago, Illinois]]\n[[Category:American blues musicians]]\n[[Category:American rock singer-songwriters]]\n[[Category:American blues singer-songwriters]]\n[[Category:American male singers]]\n[[Category:Big Brother and the Holding Company members]]"}]}}}}
