When he was proficient enough he started playing for country dances, and by 1939 had arrived in Chicago.<ref>Rowe 1973, p. 56</ref>  In Chicago he became one of a number of musicians, performing on [[Maxwell Street]] and in non-union venues, who played an important role in the development of the post-war Chicago blues sound, often performing with his first cousin, singer and guitar player [[Floyd Jones]].<ref name=\"Rowe 1973, p. 57\">Rowe 1973, p. 57</ref>  By the late 1940s he was capable of playing any kind of music requested, and had learned to play [[piano]], [[banjo]] and bass (including a home-made bass made out of a wash-tub, a broom-handle and a clothes line),<ref name=\"Rowe 1973, p. 57\"/> in addition to guitar.  He was regarded by his contemporaries as the best guitar player on the Chicago scene,<ref>Komara 2006 p. 547</ref> and was warned by noted [[slide guitar]] player [[Muddy Waters]] not to \"fool with that slide\" when Jones sat in with Waters' band one night.<ref>Rowe 1973, p. 75</ref>\n\nJones is most significant, and best known, for his association with his cousin Floyd Jones and [[harmonica]] player [[Snooky Pryor]], and for the singles he recorded with them in 1948<ref name=\"Planet\">{{cite web|url=http://hubcap.clemson.edu/~campber/planetmarvel.html|title=Planet and Marvel\n|publisher=hubcap.clemson.edu|accessdate=2008-11-22}}</ref> which were among the first recorded examples of the new style.  The track \"Snooky and Moody's Boogie\" is said to have been the inspiration for [[Little Walter]]'s 1952 hit \"[[Juke (song)|Juke]]\".<ref name=\"Komara 2006, p. 547\"/>  Jones made further recordings for the [[JOB Records|JOB]] label in the early 1950s, backing musicians such as Snooky Pryor and [[Johnny Shines]].  He sang three numbers on a 1952 session, but these were not released at the time, according to Jones because label owner Joe Brown thought his voice was \"too rough\".<ref name=\"Planet\"/>  One of the songs, \"Rough Treatment\", was recorded and released by singer and guitarist Little Hudson (Hudson Shower) for the same label the following year.<ref>Leadbitter, Fancourt and Pelletier 1994, p. 81</ref>\n\nAfter 1953 Jones stopped playing blues and joined a [[gospel music|gospel]] group,<ref name=\"Planet\"/> and by 1955 he had become pastor of a Sanctified church.<ref>Rowe 1973, p. 194</ref>\n\nJones died in Chicago, on March 23, 1988.<ref name=\"Komara 2006, p. 547\"/>\n\n==Citations==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*Komara E M (2006): ''Encyclopedia of the Blues'', Routledge.[http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=-w-uGwm_LhcC&pg=PA547&lpg=PA547&dq=%22moody+jones%22&source=web&ots=tReeYGyv-3&sig=kr8gKh66AV8OtU9U9H4mGFGpvWs&hl=en&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=6&ct=result]\n*Ledbitter M, Fancourt L and Pelletier P (1994): ''Blues Records 1943-1970 Vol 2 (L to Z)'', London, Record Information Services\n*Rowe M (1973): ''Chicago Breakdown'', London, Eddison Press\n\n{{Authority control|VIAF=74037944}}\n\n{{Persondata <!-- Metadata: see [[Wikipedia:Persondata]]. -->\n| NAME              = Jones, Moody\n| ALTERNATIVE NAMES =\n| SHORT DESCRIPTION = [[United States|American]] [[Chicago blues]] guitarist, bass player, and singer\n| DATE OF BIRTH     = April 8, 1908\n| PLACE OF BIRTH    = [[Earle, Arkansas]], [[United States]]\n| DATE OF DEATH     = March 23, 1988\n| PLACE OF DEATH    = [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]], United States\n}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Jones, Moody}}\n[[Category:1908 births]]\n[[Category:1988 deaths]]\n[[Category:Chicago blues musicians]]\n[[Category:American blues musicians]]\n[[Category:American blues guitarists]]\n[[Category:People from Crittenden County, Arkansas]]"}]}}}}
