Her meagre recordings were in a primitive [[Juke joint|barrelhouse]] style.<ref name=\"AMG\">{{cite web|author=Steve Leggett |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/ora-alexander-mn0001940742/biography |title=Ora Alexander &#124; Biography |publisher=AllMusic |date= |accessdate=2014-01-28}}</ref>  Little is known of her life outside of music.\n\n==Career==\nAlexander made ten recordings in [[New York City]] for [[Columbia Records]], between May 1931 and March 1932, although only eight of that number were ever released. From the dates of the recordings it is known that she was placed in New York at least twice within one year, although it is not certain whether she ever resided there. Her [[pianist]] was not generally named on the recordings, although it is certain that Milton Davage was her accompanist on \"I'm Wild About My Patootie\".  It is conjectured that Alexander may have accompanied herself on other tracks.<ref name=\"AMG\"/>\n\nHer saucy, ribald style was exemplified in her song, \"I Crave Your Lovin' Every Day\" (1932), where the lyrics stated, ''\"Come on daddy, get down on your knees, Sock it to my weak spot if you please\"''.<ref>{{cite book\n| first= Stephen\n| last= Calt\n| year= 2009\n| title= Barrelhouse words: a blues dialect dictionary\n| edition= 1st\n| publisher= [[University of Illinois Press]] \n| location= [[Urbana, Illinois]], [[United States]]\n| isbn= 978-0-252-03347-6\n| page= 263}}</ref>\n\n==Discography==\n===Recordings===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!
