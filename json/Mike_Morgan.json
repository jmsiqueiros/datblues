Morgan made his major league debut on June 11, throwing a complete game in a 3-0 loss to [[Scott McGregor (baseball)|Scott McGregor]] and the [[Baltimore Orioles]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/OAK/1978-schedule-scores.shtml |title=1978 Oakland Athletics Schedule, Box Scores and Splits |publisher=Baseball-Reference.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-03}}</ref> After losing his first three starts in Oakland, Morgan was sent down to AAA [[Vancouver Canadians|Vancouver]] for the rest of the season, going 5-6 with a 5.58 [[earned run average]] (ERA) in 92 [[innings pitched]]. Although he had put up less than spectacular numbers as an 18 year old, including an alarming [[strikeout-to-walk ratio]] of 0.5:1 (31 [[strikeouts]] and 62 [[Base on balls|walks]]), he was clearly on the fast track.\n\nAfter starting the 1979 season with the AAA [[Ogden A's]], Morgan was called up again to the big club after posting a 5-5 record with a 3.48 ERA in 101 innings. However, he again appeared overmatched, finishing the season 2-10 for the A's. Morgan then spent the next two seasons in the minor leagues. After finishing another unspectacular season in 1980, going 6-9 back at Ogden, Oakland traded Morgan on November 3 to the [[New York Yankees]] for 33-year-old infielder, [[Fred Stanley (baseball)|Fred Stanley]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/m/morgami01.shtml#trans |title=Mike Morgan Statistics and History |publisher=Baseball-Reference.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-03}}</ref> Thus was the start of Morgan's vagabond career. The Yankees then demoted Morgan and assigned him to AA [[Nashville Sounds|Nashville]] where he posted an 8-7 record with a 4.42 ERA in 169 innings.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/minors/player.cgi?id=morgan003mic |title=Mike Morgan Minor League Statistics & History |publisher=Baseball-Reference.com |date=1959-10-08 |accessdate=2013-03-03}}</ref>\n\n==\"The Nomad\"==\nIn [[1982 Major League Baseball season|1982]], Morgan pitched the entire season for the Yankees, pitching in 30 games with 23 starts. On December 9, Morgan was traded again, this time to the [[Toronto Blue Jays]] (along with outfielder/first baseman [[Dave Collins]] and future all star first baseman [[Fred McGriff]]) for minor league third baseman Tom Dodd and reliever [[Dale Murray]]. Morgan then split time between Toronto and AAA [[Syracuse Chiefs|Syracuse]] in 1983 before spending the entire [[1984 Major League Baseball season|1984 season]] at Syracuse. In December 1984, Morgan was taken off the Blue Jays' 40-man roster and was subsequently chosen by the [[Seattle Mariners]] in the [[Rule 5 draft]]. After losing much of 1985 to arm trouble, Morgan spent most of the next three seasons pitching for Seattle and compiling similar numbers to his career average, going 24-35 with a 4.53 over 429 innings with 216 strikeouts and 144 walks. In a hint of later career success, Morgan collected his first career [[save (baseball)|save]] in 1986. Although showing himself to be a solidly average starting pitcher, he would continue to struggle with his control, annually putting up dismal strikeouts-to-walk ratios, and failing to show the promise that made him a first round selection. On December 9, Morgan was traded to the Baltimore Orioles for righty starter [[Ken Dixon]] and split 1988 season between Baltimore and AAA [[Rochester Red Wings|Rochester]]. That year he was recognized for his humanitarian work by winning the [[Little League]]'s Junior Cy Young Award.\n\nMorgan was traded to his sixth franchise in March, in a trade with the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] for center fielder [[Mike Devereaux]], and remained with the team from 1989&ndash;91. He had his first winning season as a pro in 1991 and earned his lone [[1991 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star]] selection while finishing a 14&ndash;10 record. Morgan also led the National League with four shutouts in 1990, tied with the San Diego Padres' [[Bruce Hurst]]. On July 28, he was at the losing end of [[Montreal Expos]] pitcher [[Dennis Mart\u00ednez]]'s [[perfect game]], even though Morgan himself was perfect through the first five innings.\n\nAfter leaving Baltimore as a free agent, Morgan signed with the [[Chicago Cubs]] from 1992&ndash;95. In [[1992 Major League Baseball season|1992]], Morgan finishing the season 16&ndash;8 with a 2.55 ERA over 240 innings - easily the best season of his career. However, he could not repeat his efforts and went 12-25 over the next two seasons after again experiencing arm trouble. After seeming to bounce back in the beginning of 1995, starting the season 2-1 with a 2.19 ERA for the Cubs, he was traded to the [[St. Louis Cardinals]] (along with minor leaguer catcher Francisco Morales and first baseman/third baseman Paul Torres) for third baseman [[Todd Zeile]] and cash, and went 5-6 in 17 starts the rest of the way. In [[1996 Major League Baseball season|1996]], Morgan would return to his previous form, posting a 4-8 record with a 5.24 ERA, and was released by the Cardinals on August 28. He would not be unemployed long as he signed with the [[Cincinnati Reds]] on September 4 and spent the remainder of the 1996 and all of [[1997 Major League Baseball season|1997]] with the Reds.\n\n==Post-season play==\nAfter leaving the Reds as a free Agent, Morgan signed in December 1997 with the [[Minnesota Twins]]. After putting up good numbers with the Twins through August (4-2 with a 3.49 ERA and only 24 walks in 98 innings), Morgan was traded on August 25 back to the Cubs for pitcher [[Scott Downs]] and cash. While with the Cubs, he was on the mound when [[Mark McGwire]] hit his record-tying 61st home run. He also went to the post-season for the first time, relieving in two games without giving up a run, but the Cubs lost to the [[1998 Atlanta Braves season|Atlanta Braves]] in the [[1998 National League Division Series|National League Division Series]]. On January 29, [[1999 Major League Baseball season|1999]], Morgan joined his 11th team, signing with the [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]] as a free agent. Although he pitched to a 13-10 record, he had an ERA of 6.24 and was demoted to the bullpen late in the season.\n\nPrior to spring training in [[2000 Major League Baseball season|2000]], the 40-year-old signed with his 12th team, the [[Arizona Diamondbacks]], who successfully converted Morgan to a full-time [[relief pitcher|reliever]]. Morgan excelled in this new role and appeared in 60 games, pitched 100 innings, and compiled an ERA that was only slightly above career average. After pitching in 31 games in [[2001 Major League Baseball season|2001]], including his last career start, Morgan was again in the post-season with the [[2001 Arizona Diamondbacks season|D-backs]], appeared in all three rounds, and threw 4 2/3 innings of scoreless relief helping Arizona defeat the [[2001 New York Yankees season|New York Yankees]] in seven games to win the [[2001 World Series]]. He was back with Arizona again in 2002 and pitched 28 games over the first three months before being sidelined by an injury. He came back to make the final appearance of his career on September 2, pitching 1 1/3 innings and giving up an unearned run in a 19-1 loss to the Dodgers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/games/standings.cgi?date=2002-09-02 |title=Standings on Monday, September 2, 2002 |publisher=Baseball-Reference.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-03}}</ref> Morgan finished the season 1-1 with a 5.29 ERA and was not included on the D-Backs' post-season roster. Following the season, Morgan retired from baseball after 21 seasons.\n\nMorgan was the last active player to have competed during the 1978 season and one of the last four (the others being [[Jesse Orosco]], [[Rickey Henderson]] and [[Tim Raines]]) to have debuted in the 1970s. In the 597 games Morgan pitched, 411 were starts. His career record was 141-186 with a 4.23 ERA with 1403 strikeouts and eight saves in 2772 1/3 innings.\n\nMorgan was tied with [[National Hockey League]] player [[Mike Sillinger]] and MLB pitcher [[Matt Skrmetta]] for the most teams played for in any North American professional sport through June 2006, when Skrmetta signed with the [[Chicago White Sox]], his 24th professional team and 13th organization.<ref>[http://www.soxtalk.com/forums/lofiversion/index.php/t51156.html - Skrmetta join Chicago's Triple-A affiliate]</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\nMorgan currently resides in [[Ogden, Utah]] and owns \"World Championship Outfitters\", a company which takes people on private hunts with Morgan as the guide. In 2010, he created the \"Robinson's Transport Wounded Warrior Hunt\", a hunting trip for military members who have received a Purple Heart.<ref name=\"heraldextra1\"/> He also instructs youth baseball players one-on-one through the company \"Ultimate Sports\".\n\nFrom 2009 to 2010, he was a volunteer coach on the [[Pleasant Grove High School (Utah)|Pleasant Grove High School]] baseball team in [[Pleasant Grove, Utah]]. From 2011 to 2012, he was the pitching coach at [[Timpanogos High School (Utah)|Timpanogos High School]].\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Baseball}}\n* [[List of baseball players who went directly to the major leagues]]\n* [[List of Major League Baseball players who played in four decades]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{Baseballstats|br=m/morgami01|fangraphs=67|cube=Mike-Morgan|brm=morgan003mic}}\n\n{{1978 MLB Draft}}\n{{Oakland Athletics first-round draft picks}}\n{{Chicago Cubs Opening Day starting pitchers}}\n{{2001 Arizona Diamondbacks}}\n\n{{Persondata <!-- Metadata: see [[Wikipedia:Persondata]]. -->\n| NAME              = Morgan, Mike\n| ALTERNATIVE NAMES =\n| SHORT DESCRIPTION = American baseball player\n| DATE OF BIRTH     = October 8, 1959\n| PLACE OF BIRTH    = Tulare, California\n| DATE OF DEATH     =\n| PLACE OF DEATH    =\n}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Morgan, Mike}}\n[[Category:1959 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:Major League Baseball pitchers]]\n[[Category:Arizona Diamondbacks players]]\n[[Category:Chicago Cubs players]]\n[[Category:St. Louis Cardinals players]]\n[[Category:New York Yankees players]]\n[[Category:Seattle Mariners players]]\n[[Category:Toronto Blue Jays players]]\n[[Category:Cincinnati Reds players]]\n[[Category:Baltimore Orioles players]]\n[[Category:Texas Rangers players]]\n[[Category:Minnesota Twins players]]\n[[Category:Los Angeles Dodgers players]]\n[[Category:Oakland Athletics players]]\n[[Category:National League All-Stars]]\n[[Category:Baseball players from California]]\n[[Category:People from Tulare County, California]]\n[[Category:Vancouver Canadians players]]\n[[Category:Ogden A's players]]\n[[Category:Nashville Sounds players]]\n[[Category:Syracuse Chiefs players]]\n[[Category:Calgary Cannons players]]\n[[Category:Rochester Red Wings players]]\n[[Category:Orlando Cubs players]]\n[[Category:St. Petersburg Cardinals players]]\n[[Category:Louisville Redbirds players]]\n[[Category:Tucson Sidewinders players]]"}]}}}}
