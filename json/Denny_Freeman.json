He went to college in [[North Texas]], and had a brief stay in [[Los Angeles]], before relocating in 1970 to [[Austin, Texas]].<ref name=\"Encyclopedia\"/><ref name=\"Freeman\"/> He was co-lead guitarist in the Cobras with [[Stevie Ray Vaughan]],<ref name=\"AMG\"/> then in 1972, became a founding member of Southern Feeling, along with [[W. C. Clark]] and [[Angela Strehli]].<ref>[http://www.tunegenie.com/bio/MN0000044802/angela-strehli/ Tunegenie.com - accessed December 2009]</ref> He later recorded with [[Lou Ann Barton]].<ref name=\"AMG\"/> Freeman lived and played with both [[Jimmie Vaughan|Jimmie]] and [[Stevie Ray Vaughan]] throughout the 1970s and 1980s. He played piano on Jimmie Vaughan's first solo tour, and on a [[James Cotton]] album. At [[Clifford Antone|Antone's]] [[nightclub]] in the early 1980s, Freeman was a member of the [[house band]] and backed [[Otis Rush]], [[Albert Collins]], [[Buddy Guy]], [[Junior Wells]], and [[Lazy Lester]].<ref name=\"Encyclopedia\"/>\n\nAfter touring with Jimmie Vaughan in the mid 1990s he toured with Taj Mahal until 2002. A songwriter on his five mainly [[instrumental]] albums, Freeman lived again in Los Angeles from 1992 until 2004.<ref name=\"Encyclopedia\"/> Freeman played with [[Bob Dylan]]'s backing band between 2005 and 2009. Dylan's album, ''[[Modern Times (Bob Dylan album)|Modern Times]]'' was recorded with Dylan's then touring band, including Freeman, [[Tony Garnier (musician)|Tony Garnier]], George G Receli, Stu Kimball, plus [[multi-instrumentalist]] Donnie Herron. During a 2006 interview with ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', Dylan spoke about his current band:\n{{quote|This is the best band I've ever been in, I've ever had, man for man. When you play with guys a hundred times a year, you know what you can and can't do, what they're good at, whether you want 'em there. It takes a long time to find a band of individual players. Most bands are gangs. Whether it's a [[Heavy metal music|metal]] group or [[pop rock]], whatever, you get that gang mentality. But for those of us who went back further, gangs were the mob. The gang was not what anybody aspired to. On this record (''Modern Times'') I didn't have anybody to teach. I got guys now in my band, they can whip up anything, they surprise even me.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/11216877/the_modern_times_of_bob_dylan_a_legend_comes_to_grips_with_his_iconic_status/print| author = [[Jonathan Lethem]] | title = The Genius of Bob Dylan| accessdate = April 30, 2009| publisher = ''[[Rolling Stone]]''| date = August 21, 2006}}</ref>|Bob Dylan|August 2006, ''[[Rolling Stone]]''}}\n\n[[Clem Burke]] played the [[drum]]s on Freeman's latest solo offering, ''Twang Bang'' (2006).<ref>{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r853806|pure_url=yes}}|title=Allmusic ((( Twang Bang > Credits )))}}</ref>\n\n==Credits==\n*Freeman co-wrote \"Baboom/Mama Said\" on the The Vaughan Brothers' 1990 album, ''[[Family Style]]''<ref name=\"AMG\">{{cite web |url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p12992/biography|pure_url=yes}}|title=Denny Freeman |author=Forte, Dan |publisher=[[Allmusic]] |accessdate=February 13, 2010}}</ref>\n\n*He played piano on [[Jimmie Vaughan]]'s 1994 album, ''Strange Pleasure'',<ref>{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r198047|pure_url=yes}}|title=Allmusic ((( Strange Pleasure > Credits )))}}</ref> and organ on his 1998 follow-up, ''Out There''.<ref>{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r352903|pure_url=yes}}|title=Allmusic ((( Out There > Credits )))}}</ref>\n\n*He co-wrote \"Boom Boom in the Zoom Zoom Room\" on [[Blondie (band)|Blondie]]'s 1999 ''[[No Exit (Blondie album)|No Exit]]'' album.<ref>{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r388075|pure_url=yes}}|title=Allmusic ((( No Exit > Overview )))}}</ref>\n\n*Freeman played guitar on [[Taj Mahal (musician)|Taj Mahal]] and the Phantom Blues Band's [[Grammy Award]] winning [[live album]], ''[[Shoutin' in Key]]'' (2000).<ref>{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r487202|pure_url=yes}}|title=Allmusic ((( Shoutin' in Key > Credits )))}}</ref><ref name=\"Grammy\">[http://www.grammy.com/GRAMMY_Awards/Winners/Results.aspx?title=&winner=Taj%20Mahal%20&year=0&genreID=0&hp=1  Grammy Award Winners] (The Grammy Awards)</ref>\n\n*He played guitar on [[Percy Sledge]]'s 2004 album, ''Shining Through the Rain'', and co-wrote with Fontaine Brown the song \"Love Come and Rescue Me\".<ref>{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r707664|pure_url=yes}}|title=Allmusic ((( Shining Through the Rain > Credits )))}}</ref>\n\n*Freeman played guitar, organ and piano on [[Doyle Bramhall]]'s 2007 album, ''Is It News''.<ref>{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r941671|pure_url=yes}}|title=Allmusic ((( Is It News > Credits )))}}</ref>\n\n==Discography==\n*''Out of the Blue'' (1987) - Amazing\n*''Denny Freeman'' (1991) - Amazing\n*''A Tone for My Sins'' (1997) - Dallas Blues Society\n*''Denny Freeman and the Cobras''  ([[live album]]) (2000) - Crosscut ([[Germany]])\n*''Twang Bang'' (2006) - V8<ref>{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p12992/discography|pure_url=yes}}|title=Allmusic ((( Denny Freeman > Discography > Main Albums )))}}</ref>\n*''Diggin on Dylan'' (2012) - V8 Records\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of Texas blues musicians]]\n*[[List of electric blues musicians]]\n*[[List of Austin City Limits performers]]\n*[[Never Ending Tour]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Authority control|VIAF=227505108}}\n{{Persondata <!-- Metadata: see [[Wikipedia:Persondata]]. -->\n| NAME              =Freeman, Denny\n| ALTERNATIVE NAMES =\n| SHORT DESCRIPTION =[[United States|American]] [[Texas blues|Texas]] and [[electric blues]] guitarist\n| DATE OF BIRTH     =August 7, 1944\n| PLACE OF BIRTH    =[[Orlando, Florida]], United States\n| DATE OF DEATH     =\n| PLACE OF DEATH    =\n}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Freeman, Denny}}\n[[Category:American blues guitarists]]\n[[Category:American blues musicians]]\n[[Category:American blues pianists]]\n[[Category:Songwriters from Florida]]\n[[Category:Texas blues musicians]]\n[[Category:Electric blues musicians]]\n[[Category:Musicians from Orlando, Florida]]\n[[Category:1944 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]"}]}}}}
