Their early material has been compared by critics to Deep Purple, but they slowly began moving for a more commercially accessible [[hard rock]] style. By the turn of the decade, the band's commercial fortunes changed and they released a string of UK top 10 albums, ''[[Ready an' Willing]]'' (1980), ''[[Come an' Get It]]'' (1981), ''[[Saints & Sinners (Whitesnake album)|Saints & Sinners]]'' (1982) and ''[[Slide It In]]'' (1984), the latter of which was their first to chart in the US and is certified 2x platinum.\n\nThe band's 1987 [[Whitesnake (album)|self-titled album]] was their most commercially successful worldwide, and contained two major US hits, \"[[Here I Go Again]]\" and \"[[Is This Love (Whitesnake song)|Is This Love]]\", reaching number one and two on the [[Hot 100]]. In 1988, Whitesnake was nominated for the [[Brit Award]] for Best British Group.<ref name=\"BritNom\">{{cite web|url=http://www.brits.co.uk/artist/whitesnake |title=Whitesnake |publisher=Brits.co.uk |date=19 February 2014 |accessdate=24 April 2014}}</ref> ''[[Slip of the Tongue]]'' (1989), was also a success, reaching the top 10 in the US and UK, and receiving a platinum US certification.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?content_selector=gold-platinum-searchable-database |title=Gold & Platinum Searchable Database - April 24, 2014 |publisher=RIAA |date= |accessdate=24 April 2014}}</ref> The band split up shortly after this release, but had a reunion in 1994, and released a one-off studio album, ''[[Restless Heart (Whitesnake album)|Restless Heart]]'' (1997).\n\nWhitesnake officially reformed in 2002 and have been touring together since, releasing two studio albums, ''[[Good to Be Bad]]'' (2008) and ''[[Forevermore (Whitesnake album)|Forevermore]]'' (2011).

The core line-up had been working as his backing band '''The White Snake Band''' on the ''[[White Snake (album)|White Snake]]'' (1977) album tour and they retained the title before officially being known as Whitesnake. They toured with Coverdale as his support band and for both of the solo albums he released, ''White Snake'' (1977) and ''[[Northwinds]]'' (1978), between exiting Deep Purple and founding Whitesnake. At this time, the band was made up of [[David Coverdale]], [[Bernie Marsden]], [[Micky Moody]], [[Neil Murray (British musician)|Neil Murray]] and drummer [[Dave Dowle|David \"Duck\" Dowle]] with keyboardist Brian Johnston. Johnston would soon be replaced by [[Procol harum|Procol Harum]] organ player and keyboardist [[Pete Solley]]. Because of Solley's producing commitments he was replaced by the former [[Deep Purple]] keyboard player [[Jon Lord]], during sessions for the first LP.\n\n===Early years and commercial success (1978\u20131983)===\n[[File:Whitesnake-1980.jpg|thumb|right|Whitesnake at the [[Reading Festival]] in [[Reading, Berkshire]], England, 1980]]\nWhitesnake recorded the EP ''[[Snakebite (album)|Snakebite]]'', which was released in 1978 and included a cover of a [[Bobby Bland|Bobby \"Blue\" Bland]] song \"[[Ain't No Love in the Heart of the City]]\", their first hit song proving the [[New Wave of British Heavy Metal]] could have a chart hit.<ref>Dave Thompson (2004). \"Smoke on the Water: The Deep Purple Story\". p. 216. ECW Press, 2004</ref> The EP had some success in the UK and subsequent reissues of this EP included four bonus tracks from Coverdale's second solo album ''[[Northwinds]]'' (1978) produced by [[Roger Glover]].\n\nA blues rock/R&B debut album ''[[Trouble (Whitesnake album)|Trouble]]'', was released in the autumn of 1978 and peaked at No. 50 in the [[UK Albums Chart|UK album charts]]. Whitesnake toured Europe to promote the album and their first live album ''[[Live at Hammersmith (Whitesnake album)|Live at Hammersmith]]'' was  recorded on this tour and released in Japan in 1979. Tracks from the EP Snakebite were included in a reissue of the album ''Trouble'' in 2006.\n\nWhitesnake released ''[[Lovehunter]]'' in 1979, which courted controversy due to its risqu\u00e9 album cover by artist [[Chris Achilleos]], which featured an illustration of a naked woman straddling a coiled snake. The album made the UK Top 30 and contained the minor hit \"Long Way from Home\", which reached No. 55 in the single charts. Shortly after that drummer [[Ian Paice]] replaced David Dowle giving Whitesnake three ex-Deep Purple members. The new line-up recorded the 1980 release ''[[Ready an' Willing]]'' (1980), which was a breakthrough hit for the band reaching the UK Top 10 and becoming their first entry into the U.S. Top 100. The single \"[[Fool for Your Loving]]\", which the band originally wrote for [[B.B. King]], made No. 13 in the UK single charts and No. 53 in the US, and the title track also hit No. 43 in the UK charts. \n[[File:Whitesnake Hammersmith Odeon 1981.jpg|thumb|right|Whitesnake on stage at the [[Hammersmith Odeon]], London, 1981]]\nThe Ready an' Willing tour included the Saturday night headline appearance at the 1980 [[Reading Festival]], the highlights of which were broadcast by [[BBC Radio 1]] in the UK. While still mostly unknown in the US, the modest success of ''Ready an' Willing'' (1980) helped Whitesnake increase awareness there as an opening act for established bands such as [[Jethro Tull (band)|Jethro Tull]] and [[AC/DC]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.musicianguide.com/biographies/1608003036/David-Coverdale.html |title=David Coverdale bio at |publisher=Musicianguide.com |date= |accessdate=18 July 2011}}</ref> The band also released ''[[Live...In the Heart of the City]]'', which contained recordings made in 1978 and 1980 at the [[Hammersmith Odeon]] in London, and achieved a No. 5 ranking in the UK album charts.<ref name=\"UKCharts\"/>\n\nIn 1981 the band recorded the album ''[[Come an' Get It]]'', which climbed to No. 2 in the UK album charts and produced the Top 20 hit \"[[Don't Break My Heart Again]]\" and the Top 40 hit \"Would I Lie to You\". During 1982 Coverdale took time off to look after his sick daughter and decided to put Whitesnake on hold.\n\nWhen David Coverdale returned to music he reformed the band and after the recording of the album ''[[Saints & Sinners (Whitesnake album)|Saints & Sinners]]'' (1982) replaced Bernie Marsden, Ian Paice and bass player Neil Murray with [[Mel Galley]] from [[Trapeze (band)|Trapeze]], bassist [[Colin Hodgkinson]], and [[Cozy Powell]] as the new drummer. ''Saints & Sinners'' was another Top 10 UK album and contained the hit \"[[Here I Go Again]]\", which featured guest keyboard player Malcolm Birch from Chesterfield based band Pegasus. The new lineup toured in 1982\u201383, headlined the [[Monsters of Rock]] Festival at [[Castle Donington]] UK in August 1983 and the single \"[[Guilty of Love (Whitesnake song)|Guilty of Love]]\" reached No. 31 in the UK singles chart.<ref name=\"Roberts\"/>\n\n===Breakthrough and a change in musical style (1983\u20131985)===\n[[File:Whitesnake1983.jpg|thumb|right|Whitesnake performing live in 1983]]\nIn late 1983, the band recorded ''[[Slide It In]]'', which was released in Europe in early 1984.

The ''Slide It In'' (1984) album had drawn mixed reviews, the negatives particularly focusing on its \"flat\" mix.<ref>{{citation|year=1984|title=Deep Purple Appreciation Society \u2013 Whitesnake History'|publisher=The Deep Purple Appreciation Society|url=http://www.deep-purple.net/tree/whitesnake/whitesnake-2.htm}}</ref> While a personnel change saw the touring band replace Moody with former [[Thin Lizzy]] guitarist [[John Sykes]], plus the return of bassist Neil Murray in place of Hodgkinson,<ref>{{citation|date=July 1984|title=Deep Purple Appreciation Society Magazine, Issue 29'|publisher=The Deep Purple Appreciation Society|url=http://www.deep-purple.net/DPASmags/dtb29.htm#sykes}}</ref> producer [[David Geffen]] insisted that the album be remixed for the US release. In addition to the remix, Sykes and Murray re-recorded the lead guitar and bass parts. This revised version of the album had its US release in April 1984. Despite Coverdale's misgivings regarding the lack of edge in these new tracks, ''Slide It In'' (1984) just barely missed the US Top 40, and went [[platinum album|double platinum]] there three years later after the release of the band's eighth album.<ref name=\"RIAA\">{{cite web|url=http://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?content_selector=gold-platinum-searchable-database |title=Whitesnake: RIAA Gold and Platinum|publisher=Riaa.com|accessdate=15 June 2012}}</ref>\n[[File:Whitesnake logo.svg|thumb|left|250px|The band's first official logo appeared on their 1979 album ''[[Lovehunter]]'', and was used between 1978 and 1984.]]\nThe ''Slide It In'' (1984) album led to the [[album-oriented rock]] hits in the US: \"[[Slow an' Easy]]\" and \"[[Love Ain't No Stranger]]\", as well as the album's title track. It was at this point that Geffen suggested to Coverdale that he \"start taking America seriously.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.musicianguide.com/biographies/1608003036/David-Coverdale.html |title=David Coverdale bio at musicianguide.com, paragraph 9 |publisher=Musicianguide.com |date= |accessdate=18 July 2011}}</ref>\n\nWhile touring in spring 1984, Mel Galley suffered a broken arm in an accident, leaving John Sykes as the sole guitarist for the remaining dates. A few weeks later, Jon Lord left to reform Deep Purple Mk. II, and keyboard player Richard Bailey was brought in. The band was booked in the US to open for acts such as [[Ronnie James Dio|Dio]] and [[Quiet Riot]] Founded by [[Kevin Dubrow]]. The tour ended with a performance in front of a crowd of over 100,000 people, at the [[Rock in Rio]] festival held in [[Rio de Janeiro]], Brazil. Galley remained a member \u2014 \"he's still getting paid,\" said Coverdale \u2014 until Galley rashly discussed plans to reform Trapeze in an interview, and Coverdale then fired him.\n\n===The self-titled album and success in the US (1985\u20131988)===\n[[File:John Sykes 1984.jpg|thumb|right|180px|[[John Sykes]] co-wrote their [[Whitesnake (album)|1987 album]] with Coverdale]]\nStarting in 1985, Coverdale and Sykes began writing the material for a follow-up studio album.<ref>Wall, Mick (2010).

Hachette UK, Retrieved 15 June 2012</ref> The approach was more modern, adding a slick Eighties studio polish to a band that up until ''Slide It In'' (1984) had a bluesier sound rooted in the Seventies.  Sykes would play the rhythm and lead guitars for almost the entire album. Cozy Powell had left to join [[Emerson, Lake & Powell]]. Two musicians from the north of England were brought in for the recording of the album; drummer [[Aynsley Dunbar]], and keyboardist [[Don Airey]] from the [[Ozzy Osbourne]] band and [[Rainbow (rock band)|Rainbow]]. The album was put on hold for much of 1986, when Coverdale contracted a serious [[Sinusitis|sinus infection]] that put his singing career in jeopardy. He eventually recovered, and the ''[[Whitesnake (album)|Whitesnake]]'' album was finished in 1987. But shortly before the album's release, Coverdale had dismissed Sykes. [[Adrian Vandenberg]] and [[Vivian Campbell]] mimed Sykes' guitar parts in the videos and played in subsequent live shows.\n\nThe album was entitled ''1987'' in Europe and ''Serpens Albus'' in Japan and marked the band's biggest mainstream success in the US. With the guidance of [[A&R]] guru [[John Kalodner]], it has sold [[RIAA certification|8x platinum]] in the US.<ref name=\"RIAA\"/> The success of ''Whitesnake'' (1987) also pushed sales of ''Slide It In'' (1984) from its [[RIAA certification|RIAA certified]] gold status to platinum status, and made the band a bona fide arena headliner for the first time in North America. The album continued to sell throughout 1987 and 1988, peaking at No. 2 in the US, and No. 8 in the UK.<ref name=\"Roberts\">Roberts, David (2006). [[British Hit Singles & Albums]].

Other hit singles from the album were \"[[Still of the Night (song)|Still of the Night]]\" (#16 UK and No. 79 US) and \"[[Give Me All Your Love]]\" (#18 UK and No. 48 US in 1988).<ref name=\"Roberts\"/><ref name=\"Whitburn\"/> The album's exposure was boosted by heavy airplay of its videos on MTV, which featured actress [[Tawny Kitaen]], whom Coverdale later married. None of the band members who played on the album appeared in these videos with the exception of [[Adrian Vandenberg]], who had been hired after the others had been fired by Coverdale. Vandenberg's only work on the album was the solo on \"Here I Go Again\" though he became a full-time member of the band shortly afterwards. The resulting music videos from ''Whitesnake'' (1987) also featured new band members [[Rudy Sarzo]], [[Tommy Aldridge]] and [[Vivian Campbell]] (who also re-recorded the solo for the \"Give Me All Your Love\" remix).\n\nWhile some long-time fans viewed the ''1987'' album as a sell-out and attempt to pander to mainstream tastes at the time, Coverdale was still reaching back to his musical roots, including most prominently Led Zeppelin, but even older artists like Elvis. \"I remember the ''Jailhouse Rock'' EP,\" Coverdale said. \"It\u2019s interesting because you don\u2019t know what it is, but it gets you fluffed up. And \u2018Jailhouse Rock\u2019, contrary to what a lot of people imagine, was the inspiration for the verses of \u2018Still of the Night\u2019.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bryanreesman.com/blog/2011/03/17/digital-playlist-david-coverdale/|title=Digital Playlist: David Coverdale|accessdate=18 March 2011|date=17 March 2011|publisher=Attention Deficit Delirium|author=Bryan Reesman}}</ref>\n[[File:DavidCoverdale1983.jpg|thumb|right|170px|David Coverdale backstage at the [[List of Donington Park Festivals|Donington Festival]] in 1990]]\n\n===''Slip of the Tongue'' and more success (1988\u20131991)===\nGuitarist [[Vivian Campbell]] left Whitesnake in late 1988 due to creative differences, and so the band's line-up changed yet again for the 1989 album ''[[Slip of the Tongue]]''. Although he co-wrote all of the songs, while preparing for the recording of the album, guitarist [[Adrian Vandenberg]] sustained a serious wrist injury, making it impossible for him to play without experiencing great discomfort. Coverdale had no choice but to find a new guitar player to record the parts. He eventually found former [[Frank Zappa]] and [[David Lee Roth]] guitar player [[Steve Vai]], whom Coverdale had seen in the 1986 film ''[[Crossroads (1986 film)|Crossroads]]''. Upon its release, ''Slip of the Tongue'' (1989) sold three million copies and hit No. 10 in both the US and UK album charts.<ref name=\"Roberts\"/><ref name=\"Billboard\"/> The album also spawned three successful singles: a reworking of the band's 1980 classic \"[[Fool for Your Loving#Re-recorded version|Fool for Your Loving]]\" (#37 US and No. 43 UK), the melodic \"[[The Deeper the Love]]\" (#28 US and No. 35 UK) and \"[[Now You're Gone (Whitesnake song)|Now You're Gone]]\" (#31 UK and No. 96 US).<ref name=\"Roberts\"/><ref name=\"Whitburn\"/> Steve Vai became an official member of the band and appeared in all of the band's new music videos.\n\nWith Vai and Vandenberg both as a full-time members, the band hit the road to support the album. During the tour for ''Slip of the Tongue'', the band co-headlined the 1990 Monsters of Rock festival (their third time appearing and second headlining). After the last show of the [[Slip of the Tongue]] Liquor and poker tour in 1990, Coverdale decided he would fold the band. Coverdale announced that he would be taking a break from the music business, but the next year he started to work with former-[[Led Zeppelin]] guitarist, [[Jimmy Page]], which resulted in the album ''[[Coverdale and Page (album)|Coverdale and Page]]'' (1993). Vandenberg, Sarzo, and Aldridge remained together, forming the new band [[Manic Eden]].\n\n===''Greatest Hits'', ''Restless Heart'' and ''Starkers in Tokyo'' (1994\u20131998)===\nA new line-up of the band was assembled for 1994's ''[[Whitesnake's Greatest Hits]]'' album. They embarked on a short tour in Europe, with former [[Ratt]] guitarist [[Warren DeMartini]] playing lead guitar, drummer [[Denny Carmassi]], the return of bassist Rudy Sarzo and guitarist Adrian Vandenberg, and the addition of keyboard player [[Paul Mirkovich]] before their recording contract with Geffen expired.\n\nIn 1997 Coverdale and Vandenberg re-grouped to work together on a new Whitesnake album ''[[Restless Heart (Whitesnake album)|Restless Heart]]''. This was originally to be a solo album for Coverdale, but the record company pressures released it under the Whitesnake name. However, despite a release in both Japan and Europe, it was never available officially in the US. The album marked a return to the band's earlier R&B music. The album reached the UK Top 40 album chart and produced the [[blues]] ballad \"Too Many Tears\", which reached No. 46 on the UK singles chart.<ref name=\"Roberts\"/> The album featured Coverdale, Carmassi, Vandenberg, [[Pink Floyd]] touring bassist [[Guy Pratt]] with keyboardist Brett Tuggle who had played with [[Coverdale and Page]]. The touring lineup featured Coverdale, Vandenberg, Carmassi, [[Mr. Mister]] guitarist Steve Farris, keyboardist Derek Hilland and [[The Firm (rock band)|The Firm]] bassist Tony Franklin. During the tour, Coverdale and Vandenberg recorded [[acoustic music|unplugged]] show in Japan entitled ''[[Starkers in Tokyo]]'' (released in 1998). The two also played another unplugged show, this time for [[VH1]]. In the end of '97, Coverdale folded the band at the end of the tour, and took another break from the music business.\n\n===25th anniversary reformation (2002\u20132007)===\nIn December 2002 Coverdale reformed Whitesnake for Whitesnake's 25th anniversary the upcoming year. Joining Coverdale for a 2003 tour were guitarists [[Doug Aldrich]] of [[Dio (band)|Dio]] and [[Reb Beach]] of [[Winger (band)|Winger]], bass player [[Marco Mendoza]], drummer Tommy Aldridge and keyboard player [[Timothy Drury]]. During 2003 they headlined the [[Rock Never Stops Tour]] with other popular rock bands.\n\nThe anniversary tour line up remained stable until early 2005, when Mendoza left to pursue the [[Soul SirkUS]] project and was replaced by [[Uriah Duffy]]. In February 2006, Whitesnake released a live DVD titled, ''Live... In the Still of the Night'' and announced a Spring and Summer tour of Japan and Europe. In June 2006 it was announced Coverdale had signed Whitesnake to a new record deal with Steamhammer/SPV Records who released a double live album entitled, ''[[Live: In the Shadow of the Blues]]'' during November 2006 in UK, Germany, Switzerland and Austria. The album had tracks recorded since 2003, and also included four new studio tracks: \"Ready to Rock\", \"If You Want Me\", \"All I Want Is You\" and \"Dog\". These songs have been described by Coverdale as \"three balls-to-the-walls rockers and a ballad\".\n\nIn June 2007 the band released a dual CD/DVD titled ''1987 20th Anniversary Collector's Edition'' to mark the 20th anniversary of the mega-selling album ''1987''. This was the re-mastered album along with a host of bonus material of four live tracks from the ''Shadow of the Blues Live'' set.

On 11 August 2009 Whitesnake was playing a show at Red Rocks in [[Morrison, Colorado]], when front man David Coverdale suffered a vocal injury.
