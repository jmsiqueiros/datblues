A further issue appeared on Chicago's Boxer Records, and then \"Ten Below Zero\" (1957) on Detroit's [[Fortune Records]]. In 1959 he set up his own [[record label]], Big Star Records, whose first release was Jenkin's [[single (music)|single]] \"You\"ll Never Understand\" and \"Tell Me Where You Stayed Last Night.\" He met and played alongside [[Sonny Boy Williamson II]], before self-constructing his own [[recording studio]]. He recorded mainly local musicians including James \"Little Daddy\" Walton, Little Junior Cannady, Chubby Martin and Syl Foreman.<ref name=\"AMG\"/>\n\nJenkins went on to [[Promoter (entertainment)|promote]] the first Detroit Blues Festival in 1972, and the same year issued his first [[album]], ''The Life of Bobo Jenkins''.  The album became known as the \"red album\", due to the color of the [[record sleeve]].  It included a photograph of a younger Jenkins- who was 56 years old- within a star shape. This was a tie-in with the Big Star Records name.  Jenkins was one of the headline acts in the Detroit blues review part of the 1973 [[Ann Arbor Blues and Jazz Festival]]. Recordings from the festival were released by Schoolkids Records in 1995, which included two tracks by Jenkins. In 1974, Jenkins penned another song with political overtones, \"Watergate Blues,\" which appeared on his next album ''Here I Am a Fool in Love Again''. It boasted the same cover design as the previous release, but with a change in color was alternatively dubbed the \"green album\". [[Session musician]]s used included [[Ann Arbor, Michigan|Ann Arbor]] based artists such as Sarah Brown, Fran Christina and  [[Steve Nardella]].<ref name=\"AMG\"/> In 1976 Jenkins performed at the [[Smithsonian Institution]], as part of the celebrations marking the [[United States Bicentennial|US Bicentennial]].\n\n''Detroit All Purpose Blues'' was issued in 1977, his so-called \"yellow album\", which utilised other Detroit based blues musicians such as Buddy Folks and [[Willie D. Warren]].
