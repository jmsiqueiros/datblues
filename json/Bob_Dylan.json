He has been an influential figure in popular music and culture for more than five decades. Much of his most celebrated work dates from the 1960s, when he was an informal chronicler and a seemingly reluctant figurehead of social unrest. A number of Dylan's early songs, such as \"[[Blowin' in the Wind]]\" and \"[[The Times They Are a-Changin' (song)|The Times They Are a-Changin']]\", became anthems for the [[African-American Civil Rights Movement (1955\u20131968)|US civil rights]] and [[Opposition to the Vietnam War|anti-war]] movements. Leaving behind his initial base in the culture of the [[American folk music revival|folk music revival]], Dylan's six-minute single \"[[Like a Rolling Stone]]\" radically altered the parameters of popular music in 1965. His recordings employing [[electric instrument]]s attracted [[Electric Dylan controversy|denunciation and criticism]] from others in the folk movement.\n\nDylan's lyrics have incorporated a variety of political, social, philosophical, and literary influences. They defied existing pop music conventions and appealed hugely to the then burgeoning [[Counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture]]. Initially inspired by the performance style of [[Little Richard]], and the songwriting of [[Woody Guthrie]], [[Robert Johnson]], and [[Hank Williams]], Dylan has both amplified and personalized musical [[Music genre|genres]]. His recording career, spanning fifty years, has explored many of the traditions in American song\u2014from [[folk music|folk]], [[blues]], and [[Country music|country]] to [[gospel music|gospel]], [[rock and roll]], and [[rockabilly]] to [[Folk music of England|English]], [[Scottish folk music|Scottish]], and [[Folk music of Ireland|Irish folk music]], embracing even [[jazz]] and [[Swing music|swing]]. Dylan performs with guitar, keyboards, and harmonica. Backed by a changing line-up of musicians, he has toured steadily since the late 1980s on what has been dubbed the [[Never Ending Tour]]. His accomplishments as a recording artist and performer have been central to his career, but his greatest contribution is generally considered his songwriting.\n\nSince 1994, Dylan has published six books of drawings and paintings, and his work has been exhibited in major art galleries. As a musician, Dylan has sold more than 100 million records worldwide, making him one of the [[List of best-selling music artists|best-selling artists of all time]]; he has [[List of Bob Dylan awards|received numerous awards]] including [[Grammy]], [[Golden Globe]], and [[Academy Award]]s; he has been inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]], [[Minnesota Music Hall of Fame]], [[Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame]], and [[Songwriters Hall of Fame]]. The [[Pulitzer Prize]] jury in 2008 awarded him a [[Pulitzer Prize Special Citations and Awards|special citation]] for \"his profound impact on popular music and American culture, marked by lyrical compositions of extraordinary poetic power.\" In May 2012, Dylan received the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]] from President [[Barack Obama]].\n\n==Life and career==\n\n===Origins and musical beginnings===\nBob Dylan was born Robert Allen Zimmerman ({{lang-he|\u05e8\u05d5\u05d1\u05e8\u05d8 \u05d0\u05dc\u05df \u05e6\u05d9\u05de\u05e8\u05de\u05d0\u05df}}, [[Hebrew]] name \u05e9\u05d1\u05ea\u05d0\u05d9 \u05d6\u05d9\u05e1\u05dc \u05d1\u05df \u05d0\u05d1\u05e8\u05d4\u05dd [Shabtai Zisl ben Avraham])<ref>Sounes, p. 14, gives his Hebrew name as Shabtai Zisel ben Avraham</ref><ref>A [[Chabad]] news service gives the variant Zushe ben Avraham, which may be a [[Yiddish]] variant {{cite web | url = http://www.chabad.org/news/article_cdo/aid/573406/jewish/SingerSongwriter-Bob-Dylan-Joins-Yom-Kippur-Services-in-Atlanta.htm | title = Singer/Songwriter Bob Dylan Joins Yom Kippur Services in Atlanta | date = September 24, 2007 | accessdate =September 11, 2008 | publisher=Chabad.org News }}</ref> in St. Mary's Hospital on May 24, 1941, in [[Duluth, Minnesota]],<ref>Sounes, p. 14</ref><ref name=mnbirth>{{cite web|url=http://search.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/sse.dll?ti=0&indiv=try&db=mnbirth&h=9920599|title=Robert Allen Zimmerman|work=Minnesota Birth Index, 1935\u20132002|publisher=Ancestry.com|quote=Name: Robert Allen Zimmerman; Birth Date: 24 May 1941; Birth County: Saint Louis; Father: Abram H.

His early focus on rock and roll gave way to an interest in American folk music; in 1985, Dylan explained the attraction that folk music had exerted on him:\n\n{{quotation|The thing about rock'n'roll is that for me anyway it wasn't enough&nbsp;... There were great catch-phrases and driving pulse rhythms&nbsp;... but the songs weren't serious or didn't reflect life in a realistic way.

Shelton surmises the name Dillon had two sources: [[Marshal Matt Dillon]] was the hero of the popular TV western ''[[Gunsmoke]]''; Dillon was also the name of one of Hibbing's principal families. When writing his biography in the mid-1960s, Dylan told Shelton: \"Straighten out in your book that I did not take my name from Dylan Thomas. Dylan Thomas's poetry is for people that aren't really satisfied in their bed, for people who dig masculine romance.\" At the University of Minnesota, the singer told a few friends that Dillon was his mother's maiden name, which was untrue. The singer later told reporters that he had an uncle named Dillon. Shelton adds that only when he reached New York in 1961 did the singer begin to spell his name 'Dylan', by which time he was acquainted with the life and work of Dylan Thomas. Shelton (2011), pp. 44\u201345.</ref> Explaining his change of name in a 2004 interview, Dylan remarked: \"You're born, you know, the wrong names, wrong parents. I mean, that happens. You call yourself what you want to call yourself. This is the land of the free.\"<ref name = \"60minutes2005\"/>\n\n===1960s===\n\n====Relocation to New York and record deal====\nDylan dropped out of college at the end of his first year (May 1960). In January 1961, he traveled to New York City, hoping to perform there and visit his musical idol [[Woody Guthrie]],<ref>Sounes, p. 72</ref> who was seriously ill with [[Huntington's Disease]] in [[Greystone Park Psychiatric Hospital]].<ref>Dylan, p. 98.</ref> Guthrie had been a revelation to Dylan and was the biggest influence on his early performances. Describing Guthrie's impact on him, Dylan later wrote: \"The songs themselves had the infinite sweep of humanity in them&nbsp;... [He] was the true voice of the American spirit. I said to myself I was going to be Guthrie's greatest disciple.\"<ref>Dylan, pp. 244\u2013246.</ref> As well as visiting Guthrie in the hospital, Dylan befriended Guthrie's acolyte [[Ramblin' Jack Elliott]]. Much of Guthrie's repertoire was actually channeled through Elliott, and Dylan paid tribute to Elliott in ''[[Chronicles, Vol. 1|Chronicles]]'' (2004).<ref>Dylan, pp. 250\u2013252.</ref>\n\nFrom February 1961, Dylan played at various clubs around [[Greenwich Village]]. He befriended and picked up material from many folk singers in the Village scene, including [[Dave Van Ronk]], [[Fred Neil]], [[Odetta]], the [[New Lost City Ramblers]], and Irish musicians [[The Clancy Brothers|The Clancy Brothers and Tommy Makem]].<ref>Shelton (2011), pp. 74\u201378.</ref> In September, Dylan gained some public recognition when [[Robert Shelton (critic)|Robert Shelton]] wrote a positive review in ''[[The New York Times]]'' of a show at [[Gerde's Folk City]].<ref>Shelton, Robert (September 21, 1961).

An interview with Silver on DVD, filmed for the documentary ''[[No Direction Home]]'' but not used, was included with the album ''[[Together Through Life]]''.</ref> Grossman remained Dylan's manager until 1970, and was notable both for his sometimes confrontational personality, and for the fiercely protective loyalty he displayed towards his principal client.<ref>Gray (2006), pp. 283\u2013284.</ref> Dylan subsequently said of Grossman, \"He was kind of like a [[Colonel Tom Parker]] figure&nbsp;... you could smell him coming.\"<ref name = \"No Direction Home\" /> Tensions between Grossman and [[John H.

Many of the songs on this album were labeled [[protest song]]s, inspired partly by Guthrie and influenced by [[Pete Seeger]]'s passion for topical songs.<ref>Shelton, pp. 138\u2013142.</ref> \"Oxford Town\", for example, was a sardonic account of [[James Meredith]]'s ordeal as the first black student to risk enrollment at the [[University of Mississippi]].<ref>Shelton, p. 156.</ref>\n\nHis most famous song at this time, \"[[Blowin' in the Wind]]\", partially derived its melody from the traditional [[slave]] song \"No More Auction Block\", while its lyrics questioned the social and political status quo.<ref>The booklet by [[John Bauldie]] accompanying Dylan's ''[[The Bootleg Series Volumes 1\u20133 (Rare & Unreleased) 1961\u20131991]]'' (1991) says: \"Dylan acknowledged the debt in 1978 to journalist Marc Rowland: ''Blowin' In The Wind' has always been a spiritual.

With its veiled references to an impending apocalypse, the song gained even more resonance when the [[Cuban Missile Crisis|Cuban missile crisis]] developed only a few weeks after Dylan began performing it.<ref>Heylin (2000), pp. 101\u2013103.</ref><ref group=a>In a May 1963 interview with [[Studs Terkel]], Dylan broadened the meaning of the song, stating \"the pellets of poison flooding the waters\" refers to \"the lies people are told on their radios and in their newspapers\".

Humor was a large part of Dylan's persona,<ref>Scaduto, p. 35.</ref> and the range of material on the album impressed many listeners, including [[The Beatles]]. [[George Harrison]] said, \"We just played it, just wore it out. The content of the song lyrics and just the attitude\u2014it was incredibly original and wonderful.\"<ref>''Mojo'' magazine, December 1993.</ref>\n\nThe rough edge of Dylan's singing was unsettling to some early listeners but an attraction to others. Describing the impact that Dylan had on her and her husband, [[Joyce Carol Oates]] wrote: \"When we first heard this raw, very young, and seemingly untrained voice, frankly nasal, as if sandpaper could sing, the effect was dramatic and electrifying.\"<ref>Hedin, p. 259.</ref> Many of his most famous early songs first reached the public through more immediately palatable versions by other performers, such as [[Joan Baez]], who became Dylan's advocate, as well as his lover.<ref>Sounes, pp. 136\u2013138.</ref> Baez was influential in bringing Dylan to national and international prominence by recording several of his early songs and inviting him onstage during her own concerts.<ref>Joan Baez entry, Gray (2006), pp. 28\u201331.</ref>\n\nOthers who recorded and had hits with Dylan's songs in the early and mid-1960s included [[The Byrds]]; [[Sonny and Cher]]; [[The Hollies]]; [[Peter, Paul and Mary]]; [[The Association]]; [[Manfred Mann]]; and [[The Turtles]].

Here was a further devaluing of the notion of a new Bob Dylan album as something significant.\"<ref name=\"Gray 2000, p. 13\">Gray (2000), p. 13.</ref> The critical and commercial disappointment of that album was swiftly followed by the success of the [[Traveling Wilburys]]. Dylan co-founded the band with [[George Harrison]], [[Jeff Lynne]], [[Roy Orbison]], and [[Tom Petty]], and in late 1988 their multi-platinum ''[[Traveling Wilburys Vol. 1]]'' reached number three on the US album chart,<ref name = \"Sounes 385\"/> featuring songs that were described as Dylan's most accessible compositions in years.<ref>Heylin (2000), pp. 627\u2013628.</ref> Despite Orbison's death in December 1988, the remaining four recorded a second album in May 1990, which they released with the unexpected title ''[[Traveling Wilburys Vol. 3]]''.<ref>Heylin (2000), pp. 638\u2013640.</ref>\n\nDylan finished the decade on a critical high note with ''[[Oh Mercy]]'' produced by [[Daniel Lanois]]. Dylan critic Michael Gray wrote that the album was: \"Attentively written, vocally distinctive, musically warm, and uncompromisingly professional, this cohesive whole is the nearest thing to a great Bob Dylan album in the 1980s.\"<ref name=\"Gray 2000, p. 13\"/><ref>Dylan, pp. 145\u2013221.</ref> The track \"Most of the Time\", a lost love composition, was later prominently featured in the film ''[[High Fidelity (film)|High Fidelity]]'', while \"What Was It You Wanted?\" has been interpreted both as a catechism and a wry comment on the expectations of critics and fans.<ref>Ricks, pp. 413\u201320.</ref> The religious imagery of \"Ring Them Bells\" struck some critics as a re-affirmation of faith.<ref>Scott Marshall wrote: \"When Dylan sings that 'The sun is going down upon the sacred cow', it's safe to assume that the sacred cow here is the biblical metaphor for all false gods.

The album contained several apparently simple songs, including \"Under the Red Sky\" and \"Wiggle Wiggle\". The album was dedicated to \"Gabby Goo Goo\"; this was later explained as a nickname for the daughter of Dylan and [[Carolyn Dennis]], Desiree Gabrielle Dennis-Dylan, who was four at that time.<ref>Gray (2006), p. 174.</ref> [[Sidemen]] on the album included George Harrison, [[Slash (musician)|Slash]] from [[Guns N' Roses]], [[David Crosby]], [[Bruce Hornsby]], [[Stevie Ray Vaughan]], and [[Elton John]]. Despite the stellar line-up, the record received bad reviews and sold poorly.<ref>Sounes, p. 391.</ref>\n\nIn 1991, Dylan was honored by the recording industry with a [[Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award]] from American actor [[Jack Nicholson]].<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.grammy.org/recording-academy/awards/lifetime-awards| title = Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award| accessdate =September 25, 2008| publisher=Grammy.com}}</ref> The event coincided with the start of the [[Gulf War]] against [[Saddam Hussein]], and Dylan performed his song \"[[Masters of War]]\". Dylan then made a short speech, stating \"My daddy once said to me, he said, 'Son, it is possible for you to become so defiled in this world that your own mother and father will abandon you. If that happens, God will believe in your ability to mend your own ways.'\"<ref name = \"Heylin-664\">Heylin (2000), pp. 664\u2013665.</ref> This sentiment was subsequently revealed to be a quote from 19th-century German Jewish intellectual, Rabbi [[Samson Raphael Hirsch]].<ref>Bell, 2012, ''Once Upon a Time: The Lives of Bob Dylan.'', p. 101.</ref>\n\nThe next few years saw Dylan returning to his roots with two albums covering old folk and blues numbers: ''[[Good as I Been to You]]'' (1992) and ''[[World Gone Wrong]]'' (1993), featuring interpretations and acoustic guitar work. Many critics and fans commented on the quiet beauty of the song \"Lone Pilgrim\",<ref>Gray (2006), p. 423.</ref> written by a 19th-century teacher and sung by Dylan with a haunting reverence. In November 1994 Dylan recorded two live shows for ''[[MTV Unplugged]]''. He claimed his wish to perform a set of traditional songs for the show was overruled by [[Sony]] executives who insisted on a greatest hits package.<ref>Sounes, pp. 408\u2013409.</ref> The album produced from it, ''[[MTV Unplugged (Bob Dylan album)|MTV Unplugged]]'', included \"John Brown\", an unreleased 1963 song detailing the ravages of both war and [[jingoism]].\n[[File:B dylan 1996.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Dylan and members of his band perform onstage.

His scheduled European tour was cancelled, but Dylan made a speedy recovery and left the hospital saying, \"I really thought I'd be seeing [[Elvis Presley|Elvis]] soon.\"<ref>Sounes, p. 420.</ref> He was back on the road by midsummer, and performed before [[Pope John Paul II]] at the World Eucharistic Conference in [[Bologna]], Italy.

In [[Mike Marqusee]]'s words: \n<blockquote>\nBetween late 1964 and the summer of 1966, Dylan created a body of work that remains unique.
