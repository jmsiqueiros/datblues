She recorded songs such as \"My Back to the Wall\" and \"Good Grindin\", and variously worked alongside [[Clarence Williams (musician)|Clarence Williams]], [[Joe \"King\" Oliver]], [[Lonnie Johnson (musician)|Lonnie Johnson]], [[Little Brother Montgomery]], [[Albert Nicholas]], and [[Kid Ory]].<ref name=\"Dead\">[http://thedeadrockstarsclub.com/deadrock.html Thedeadrockstarsclub.com] - accessed October 2010</ref> Scruggs achieved some success but today remains largely forgotten.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sundayblues.org/archives/tag/irene-scruggs|title=Irene Scruggs|author=|publisher=Sundayblues.org |accessdate=October 22, 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Biography==\nScruggs originated in rural [[Mississippi]], but it is believed that she was raised in [[St. Louis, Missouri]]. [[Mary Lou Williams]] recalled Scruggs being a singer of some standing when Williams travelled to St. Louis in [[vaudeville]].  Scruggs was hired by the revue company, and her career there sometimes outshone her work as a recording artist and [[nightclub]] singer.  Nevertheless, Scruggs got to sing with a number of [[Joe \"King\" Oliver]]'s bands that played in St. Louis in the mid-1920s.<ref name=\"AMG\"/> Scruggs was later accompanied by [[Blind Blake]].<ref name=\"Russell\">{{cite book\n| first= Tony\n| last= Russell\n| year= 1997\n| title= The Blues: From Robert Johnson to Robert Cray\n| edition= \n| publisher= Carlton Books Limited \n| location= Dubai\n| isbn= 1-85868-255-X\n| page= 94}}</ref> In her live shows her song, \"Itching Heel\", provided the platform for interplay between the Scruggs' singing and Blake's guitar work. \"He don't do nothing but play on his old guitar,\" Scruggs sangs, \"While I'm busting suds out in the white folks' yard.\"<ref name=\"AMG\"/> \n\nShe first [[sound recording and reproduction|recorded]] in 1924, utilising Clarence Williams as her pianist on [[Okeh Records]]. In 1926 she reignited her working association with Oliver.<ref name=\"AMG\"/> Two of the songs that Scruggs wrote, \"Home Town Blues\" and \"Sorrow Valley Blues\", were both recorded by Oliver.<ref>{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=irene-scruggs-p123364/songs/songs-composed-by|pure_url=yes}} |title=Allmusic ((( Irene Scruggs > Songs > Songs Composed By )))}}</ref> She recorded again for Okeh in 1927, this time with [[Lonnie Johnson (musician)|Lonnie Johnson]]. Scruggs formed her own band in the late 1920s, and appeared regularly performing around the St. Louis area.<ref name=\"AMG\"/>\n\nUsing the pseudonym, Chocolate Brown, she recorded further tracks with Blind Blake, and to avoid contractual problems also appeared billed as Dixie Nolan. By the early 1930s, [[Little Brother Montgomery]] took over as her accompanist on both recordings and touring work.<ref name=\"AMG\"/> \n\nScruggs also sang and recorded more sexually explicit material. \"Good Grindin'\" and \"Must Get Mine in Front\" (1930) were the better-known examples of her [[dirty blues]], and some of her work appeared in ''The Nasty Blues'', published by the [[Hal Leonard Corporation]]. Scruggs only recorded a small batch of songs, and her recording career finished around 1935. In the 1940s, Scruggs left the [[United States]] for [[Europe]], first settling in [[Paris]], and later relocating to [[Germany]]. In the 1950s, Scruggs undertook a number of [[BBC Radio]] broadcasts.<ref name=\"AMG\"/>\n\nIt is thought that she died in Germany, although no definitive information has been unearthed.<ref name=\"AMG\">{{cite web |url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=irene-scruggs-p123364/biography|pure_url=yes}} |title=Irene Scruggs|author=Chadbourne, Eugene |authorlink=Eugene Chadbourne |publisher=[[Allmusic]] |accessdate=October 22, 2010}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of Piedmont blues musicians]]\n*[[List of country blues musicians]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&q=cache:m7csfh-9xy4J:www.bluesandrhythm.co.uk/documents/BR254-Irene-Scruggs.pdf+irene+scruggs+good+grindin'&hl=nl&gl=be&pid=bl&srcid=ADGEESiMDe6hi1RVI_MIK82FB-NZucQmSDqKsncUsSq4jNCJA_2p3rVb7HOhfZTO_Iz0Co0Fss8qaPXhX3ooQ3f4e9u6BMjdKV-kWmG-EUZtyPzIdkO-iNmqibrvK1pMENN0y9umpgKz&sig=AHIEtbSwusBYuKo0HSCaLYG3PXkiYpE-3w Detailed information about her life and recordings]\n\n{{Authority control|VIAF=23863391}}\n{{Persondata <!-- Metadata: see [[Wikipedia:Persondata]]. -->\n| NAME              = Scruggs, Irene\n| ALTERNATIVE NAMES =\n| SHORT DESCRIPTION = [[United States|American]] [[Piedmont blues]] and [[country blues]] [[singing|singer]]\n| DATE OF BIRTH     = December 7, 1901\n| PLACE OF BIRTH    = [[Mississippi]], [[United States]]\n| DATE OF DEATH     = July 20, 1981\n| PLACE OF DEATH    =\n}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Scruggs, Irene}}\n[[Category:1901 births]]\n[[Category:1981 deaths]]\n[[Category:American blues singers]]\n[[Category:American jazz singers]]\n[[Category:American female singers]]\n[[Category:Blues musicians from Mississippi]]\n[[Category:Songwriters from Mississippi]]\n[[Category:Piedmont blues musicians]]\n[[Category:Country blues musicians]]\n[[Category:Dirty blues musicians]]\n[[Category:Musicians from St. Louis, Missouri]]"}]}}}}
