Doyle also played with [[Sunnyland Slim]]. Edwards met Doyle for the first time in [[Memphis]] in 1935. At this point Doyle usually performed in Handy Park, Memphis. Doyle was still alive and still performing in Handy Park in 1943, when Edwards again came to Memphis. In 1943, Edwards sometimes performed in Handy Park together with Doyle, Big Walter Horton and a young [[Little Walter]]. Edwards remembered Doyle clearly and he described him as a quite charismatic figure. According to Edward's description, Doyle was a red-eyed alcoholic who was drunk all the time, and had two or three gold teeth. No photos of Doyle seems to be known. Doyle was most likely called Little Buddy Doyle because of his diminutive height; according to Edward's description Doyle \"... was a midget. His legs was so short that when he sat on the bench to play the guitar he couldn\u00b4t pat his feet. He had to just bump against the seat, his feet would be that far off the ground. He\u00b4d get to playing the blues and just bump, bump, bump.\"<ref>{{cite book\n| first= David Honeyboy\n| last= Edwards\n| year= 1997\n| title= The World Don't Owe Me Nothing\n| edition= \n| publisher=Chicago Review Press\n| location= Chicago, Illinois, United States\n| page= 58\n| isbn= 1-55652-368-8}}</ref>\n\nWhen Edwards met him in 1935 he was married to Hedda, who was six feet tall. According to Edwards, Hedda too was \"a good guitar player in the key of G.\" She sometimes performed with Doyle.\n\nLittle else is known of Doyle's life outside of his recorded work, and his death appears to be unrecorded.\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of Memphis blues musicians]]\n*[[List of country blues musicians]]\n\n==Discography==\nDoyle's known tracks include \"Bad in Mind Blues\"; \"Grief Will Kill You\", \"Hard Scufflin' Blues\", \"Lost Baby Blues\", \"Renewed Love Blues\", \"She's Got Good Dry Goods\", \"Slick Caper Blues\", \"Sweet Man Blues\" and \"Three Sixty Nine Blues\".
