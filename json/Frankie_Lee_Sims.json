He released nine [[single (music)|single]]s during his career, one of which, \"Lucy Mae Blues\" (1953) was a regional hit. Two compilation albums of his work were released posthumously.\n\nSims was the cousin of another [[Texas blues]] musician, [[Lightnin' Hopkins]], and he worked with several other prominent blues musicians, including [[Alger \"Texas\" Alexander|Texas Alexander]], [[T-Bone Walker]], [[King Curtis]] and [[Albert Collins]]. Sims is regarded as one of the important figures in [[post-war]] Texas country blues.\n\n==Biography==\nFrankie Lee Sims was born on April 30, 1917 in [[New Orleans]], [[Louisiana]],<ref name=Dahl/> to Henry Sims and Virginia Summuel.<ref name=\"Harris\">Harris, S. (1981). ''Blues Who's Who''. New York: Da Capo Press, p. 461.</ref> He claimed he was born on February 29, 1906,<ref name=Lucy-LP-notes/> but 1906 was not a [[leap year]] and April 30, 1917 is generally accepted as his birth date.<ref name=Walkin-LP-notes/> He was the nephew of Texas blues singer [[Alger \"Texas\" Alexander|Texas Alexander]],<ref name=Herzhaft/> and the cousin of Texan guitarist [[Lightnin' Hopkins]].<ref name=Dahl/> Both Sims's parents were \"accomplished guitarists\".<ref name=Walkin-LP-notes/> His family moved to [[Marshall, Texas]] in the late 1920s, and at the age of 12 he learnt to play guitar from Texas blues musician [[Little Hat Jones]]<ref name=Dahl/><ref name=Herzhaft/> and ran away from home to work as a musician.<ref name=\"Harris\"/>  In the late 1930s Sims had a dual career of a teacher in [[Palestine, Texas]] on weekdays and a guitarist at local dances and parties on weekends. When the US entered the [[World War II|Second World War]] at the end of 1941, Sims enlisted, becoming a Marine for three years. After the war Sims made [[Dallas]] his home where he pursued a full-time career in music.<ref name=Walkin-LP-notes/>\n\nIn Dallas Sims encountered, and performed with, Texas blues guitarists [[T-Bone Walker]] and [[Smokey Hogg]] in local clubs. In 1948 Sims recorded two [[single (music)|single]]s for Blue Bonnet Records, but his first success came in 1953 when he recorded his song, \"Lucy Mae Blues\" for [[Art Rupe]]'s [[Specialty Records]], which went on to become a regional hit.<ref name=Dahl/> The ''Encyclopedia of the Blues'' called \"Lucy Mae Blues\" a \"masterpiece of rhythm and good humor\".<ref name=Herzhaft/> Sims continued recording songs for Specialty through the mid-1950s, many of them not released at the time. In 1957 he moved to [[Johnny Vincent]]'s [[Ace Records (US)|Ace Records]] and recorded several songs, including \"Walking with Frankie\" and \"She Likes to Boogie Real Low\", which [[Allmusic]] called \"mighty rockers\".<ref name=Dahl/>  Members of his band in 1957 were Willie Taylor (piano), Jack White (tenor saxophone), Ralph Morgan (bass), and [[Mercy Baby|Jimmy \"Mercy Baby\" Mullins]] (drums).<ref name=marion>[http://home.earthlink.net/~v1tiger/FLSims.html J C Marion, \"Some Texas Blues : Frankie Lee Sims and Mercy Baby\", 2007]. Retrieved 18 May 2014</ref> Sims also recorded with other blues musicians, including his cousin Hopkins,<ref name=Dahl/> and appears on several of their records.<ref name=Wirz/> In the early 1960s Hopkins \"cashed in\" on the [[Roots revival|folk-blues revival]],<ref name=Dahl/> but Sims faded into obscurity.<ref name=Walkin-LP-notes/>\n\nIn 1969 blues historian [[Chris Strachwitz]] tracked Sims down to record him on his [[Arhoolie Records|Arhoolie]] label,<ref name=Herzhaft/> but Sims died soon after on May 10, 1970 in Dallas at the age of 53.<ref name=Dahl/> The cause of death was pneumonia brought on by his poor health.<ref name=Walkin-LP-notes/> At the time of his death he was reported to have had a drinking problem and was under investigation regarding a \"shooting incident\".<ref name=Dahl/> Soon after his death, Specialty Records released a compilation album of Sim's recordings with the label, ''Lucy Mae Blues''.<ref name=Koda/> In 1985 Krazy Kat released ''Walkin' With Frankie'', an album of unreleased songs he had recorded for the label in 1960.<ref name=Wirz/>\n\n==Style and influence==\nAlong with [[Lightnin' Hopkins]] and [[Lil' Son Jackson]], Sims is regarded as \"one of the great names in [[post-war]] [[Texas blues|Texas country blues]]\".<ref name=Herzhaft/> According to the ''Encyclopedia of the Blues'', his was a \"considerable\" influence on other musicians in Dallas.<ref name=Herzhaft/> [[T-Bone Walker]] acknowledged Sims's effect on his style of playing, and Hopkins got some of his ideas from him. Sims also guided several musicians at the start of their careers, including [[King Curtis]] and [[Albert Collins]].<ref name=Herzhaft/>\n\nSims's style of guitar playing was to produce rhythmical patterns over and over, but with a slight change in each repetition, giving his music an \"irresistible dance beat\".<ref name=Herzhaft/> He produced a \"twangy, ringing\" sound on his electric guitar that was \"irresistible on fast numbers and stung hard on the downbeat stuff\".<ref name=Dahl/>\n\n==Discography==\nSource: Frankie Lee Sims Discography<ref name=Wirz/>\n\n===Singles (7-inch)===\n*\"Home Again Blues\"/\"Cross Country Blues\" (1948, Blue Bonnet 147)\n*\"Don't Forget Me Baby\"/\"Single Man Blues\" (1948, Blue Bonnet 148)\n*\"Lucy Mae Blues\"/\"Don't Take It Out On Me\" (1953, [[Specialty Records|Specialty]] 459)\n*\"I'm Long Long Gone\"/\"Yeh Baby\" (1953, Specialty 478)\n*\"Rhumba My Boogie\"/\"I'll Get Along Somehow\" (1954, Specialty 487)\n*\"What Will Lucy Do?\"/\"Misery Blues\" (1957, [[Ace Records (US)|Ace]] 524)\n*\"Hey Little Girl\"/\"Walkin' With Frankie\" (1957, Ace 527)\n*\"She Likes To Boogie Real Low\"/\"Well Goodbye Baby\" (1958, Vin 1006)\n*\"I Warned You Baby\"/\"My Talk Didn't Do No Good\" (1958, Ace 539)\n*\"Married Woman\"/\"Lucy Mae\" (1971, Specialty 478-45)\n\n===Compilation albums (LP)===\n*''Lucy Mae Blues'' (1970, Specialty SP/SPS 2124)\n*''Walkin' With Frankie'' (1985, Krazy Kat KK7428)\n\n==See also==\n{{external media| align  = right| width  = 230px| image1 = [http://www.wirz.de/music/simsfrm.htm Frankie Lee Sims] by [[Chris Strachwitz]]}}\n*[[List of blues musicians]]\n*[[List of country blues musicians]]\n*[[List of electric blues musicians]]\n*[[List of Texas blues musicians]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|refs=\n*<ref name=Herzhaft>{{cite book | author = Herzhaft, G\u00e9rard; Harris, Paul; Haussler, Jerry; Mikofsky, Anton J. | title = Encyclopedia of the Blues | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=sOKZKESWys0C&lpg=PP1&pg=PA187#v=onepage&q&f=false | publisher = [[University of Arkansas Press]] | year = 1997 | isbn = 1-55728-452-0 | pages = 187\u2013188 | accessdate = 2010-10-19}}</ref>\n*<ref name=Dahl>{{cite web | url = {{Allmusic|class=artist|id=frankie-lee-sims-p125539/biography|pure_url=yes}} | title = Frankie Lee Sims | work = [[Allmusic]] | last = Dahl | first = Bill | accessdate = 2010-10-19}}</ref>\n*<ref name=Koda>{{cite web | url = {{Allmusic|class=album|id=lucy-mae-blues-r89502|pure_url=yes}} | title = Lucy Mae Blues | work = [[Allmusic]] | last = Koda | first = Cub | accessdate = 2010-10-19}}</ref>\n*<ref name=Wirz>{{cite web | url = http://www.wirz.de/music/simsfrm.htm | title = Frankie Lee Sims Discography | work = American Music | last = Wirz | first = Stefan | accessdate = 2010-10-19}}</ref>\n*<ref name=Lucy-LP-notes>Sims, Frankie Lee.
