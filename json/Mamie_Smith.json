As a vaudeville singer she performed a number of styles, including [[jazz]] and [[blues]]. She entered blues history by being the first [[African-American]] artist to make vocal blues recordings in 1920. [[Willie \"The Lion\" Smith]] (no relation) explained the background to that recording in his autobiography, ''Music on My Mind''.\n\n==Early life==\nMamie Robinson was born probably in [[Cincinnati]], [[Ohio]], although no records of her birth exist.<ref name=Oliver /><ref name=Tracy /> When she was ten years old, she found work touring with a white act called the Four Dancing Mitchells.<ref name=Gates458 /> As a teenager, she danced in [[Tutt Brothers|Salem Tutt Whitney]]'s Smart Set.<ref name=Oliver /> In 1913, she left the Tutt Brothers to sing in clubs in [[Harlem]] and married a singer named William \"Smitty\" Smith.<ref name=Gates458 />\n\n==Musical career==\nOn August 10, 1920, in [[New York City]], Smith recorded a set of songs written by the African-American songwriter [[Perry Bradford]], including \"[[Crazy Blues]]\" and \"It's Right Here For You (If You Don't Get It, 'Tain't No Fault of Mine)\", on [[Okeh Records]].<ref name=Weisenfeld /> It was the first recording of vocal blues by an African-American artist,<ref name=Whalan /><ref name=\"Music\">{{cite book\n| first= Paul\n| last= Du Noyer\n| year= 2003\n| title= The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Music\n| edition= 1st\n| publisher= Flame Tree Publishing\n| location= Fulham, London\n| isbn= 1-904041-96-5\n| page= 154}}</ref> and the record became a best seller, selling a million copies in less than a year.<ref name=Schuller /> To the surprise of record companies, large numbers of the record were purchased by African Americans, and there was a sharp increase in the popularity of [[race record]]s.<ref name=Gates460 /> Because of the historical significance of \"Crazy Blues\", it was inducted into the [[List of Grammy Hall of Fame Award recipients A-D|Grammy Hall of Fame]] in 1994,<ref>[http://www.grammy.org/recording-academy/awards/hall-of-fame#c Grammy Hall of Fame]</ref> and, in 2005, was selected for permanent preservation in the [[National Recording Registry]] at the [[Library of Congress]].\n\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Mamie Smith-Complete Works Vol 1.png|thumb|left|Mamie Smith on the sleeve of volume 1 of the ''Complete Recorded Works'' reissue collection]] -->Although other African Americans had been recorded earlier, such as [[George W. Johnson]] in the 1890s, they were African-American artists performing music which had a substantial following with European-American audiences. The success of Smith's record prompted record companies to seek to record other female blues singers and started the era of what is now known as [[classic female blues]].<ref name=\"Music\"/> It also opened up the music  industry to recordings by, and for, African Americans in other genres.\n\nSmith continued to make a series of popular recordings for Okeh throughout the 1920s. In 1924 she made three releases for [[Ajax Records]] which, while heavily promoted, did not sell well.<ref>{{cite book |title= American Record Labels and Companies - An Encyclopedia (1891-1943)|last1= Sutton|first1= Allan|last2= Nauck|first2=Kurt|year= 2000|publisher= Mainspring Press|location= Denver, Colorado|isbn= 0-9671819-0-9|pages= 3\u20134}}</ref>  She also made some records for [[Victor Talking Machine Company|Victor]].

This billing of Mamie Smith was soon one-upped by [[Bessie Smith]], who called herself \"The Empress of the Blues.\"  And like Bessie did, Mamie too found that the new mass medium of radio provided a way to gain additional fans, especially in cities with predominantly white audiences. For example, she and several members of her band performed on KGW in Portland OR in early May 1923, and she earned very positive reviews.<ref>\"Broadcasting from KGW.\" Portland Oregonian, May 5, 1923, p. 11.</ref>\n\nVarious recording lineups of her Jazz Hounds included (from August 1920 to October 1921) Jake Green, Curtis Moseley, [[Garvin Bushell]], [[Johnny Dunn]], Dope Andrews, Ernest Elliot, [[Porter Grainger]], Leroy Parker, [[Bob Fuller]], and (June 1922-January 1923) [[Coleman Hawkins]], [[Everett Robbins (musician)|Everett Robbins]], [[Johnny Dunn]], Herschel Brassfield, [[Herb Flemming]], [[Buster Bailey]] Cutie Perkins, Joe Smith, [[Bubber Miley]] and Cecil Carpenter.<ref>[http://books.google.es/books?id=yCHJQ-Qc6zkC&pg=PA404&dq=Everett+Robbins+rolls&hl=es&sa=X&ei=op2TUb3zCOmN7Qbp7IDADA&ved=0CEgQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=Everett%20Robbins%20rolls&f=false Gibbs, Craig Martin (2012) ''Black Recording Artists, 1877-1926: An Annotated Discography'', pp. 73-122.

She retired from recording and performing in 1931. She returned to performing in 1939 to appear in the motion picture ''[[Paradise in Harlem]]'' produced by her husband Jack Goldberg. She appeared in further films, including ''Mystery in Swing'', ''Sunday Sinners'' (1940), ''Stolen Paradise'' (1941), ''[[Murder on Lenox Avenue]]'' (1941), and ''Because I Love You'' (1943).
