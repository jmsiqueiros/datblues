Maghett was born in Grenada, Mississippi and learned to play the blues from listening to records by [[Muddy Waters]] and [[Little Walter]]. After moving to Chicago at the age of nineteen, he was signed by [[Cobra Records]] and became well known as a bluesman after his first record, \"All Your Love\" in 1957. He was known for his distinctive [[tremolo]]-guitar playing.<ref name=\"gillett\">\n{{cite book\n| first=Charlie\n| last=Gillett \n| year= 1996\n| title= The Sound of the City: The Rise of Rock and Roll\n| edition= (2nd Ed.)\n| publisher= Da Capo Press\n| location=New York, N.Y.\n| pages= 177\u2013179\n| isbn= 0-306-80683-5\n}}</ref>\n\n==Life and career==\nAfter moving to Chicago in 1950, his guitar playing earned bookings at blues clubs on the West Side. Sam recorded for Cobra Records from 1957 to 1959, recording singles including \"All Your Love\" and \"Easy Baby\". They did not appear on the record charts, yet they had a profound influence, far beyond Chicago's guitarists and singers. Together with recordings by [[Otis Rush]]  and [[Buddy Guy]] (also Cobra artists), they made a manifesto for a new kind of blues.<ref name=\"russell\"/> Around this time Sam also worked briefly with [[Homesick James Williamson]].<ref name=\"russell\"/> Sam gained a following before being drafted into the U.S. Army. He served six months in prison for desertion and received a [[dishonorable discharge]].<ref name=\"oldies\">[http://www.oldies.com/artist-biography/Magic-Sam.html oldies.com biography - accessed January 2008]</ref> \n\nIn 1963, he gained national attention for his single \"Feelin' Good (We're Gonna Boogie)\". After successfully touring the U.S., Britain and Germany, he was signed to [[Delmark Records]] in 1967 where he recorded ''[[West Side Soul]]'' and ''[[Black Magic (Magic Sam album)|Black Magic]]''. He also continued performing live and toured with [[Richter-tuned harmonica|blues harp]] player [[Charlie Musselwhite]] and [[Sam Lay]].\n\nSam's breakthrough performance was at the [[Ann Arbor Blues Festival]] in 1969,<ref>[http://www.cascadeblues.org/History/MagicSam.htm casacadeblues.org biography - accessed January 2008]</ref> which won him many bookings in the U.S. and Europe. His life and career was cut short when he suddenly died of a [[heart attack]] in December 1969. He was 32 years old. He is buried in the [[Restvale Cemetery]] in [[Alsip, Illinois]]. In February 1970, the [[Butterfield Blues Band]] played at a benefit concert for Magic Sam, at [[Fillmore West]] in [[San Francisco]].  Also on the bill were [[Mike Bloomfield]], [[Elvin Bishop]], Charlie Musselwhite and [[Nick Gravenites]].<ref name=\"NME Rock 'N' Roll Years\">\n{{cite book\n| first= John\n| last= Tobler\n| year= 1992\n| title= NME Rock 'N' Roll Years\n| edition= 1st\n| publisher= Reed International Books Ltd \n| location= London\n| page= 209\n| id= CN 5585\n}}</ref>\n\nHis guitar style, vocals, and songwriting ability have inspired and influenced many blues musicians ever since. In ''[[The Blues Brothers (film)|The Blues Brothers]]'', [[John Belushi|Jake Blues]] dedicates the band's performance of \"[[Sweet Home Chicago]]\" to the \"late, great Magic Sam\".\n\nThe stage name Magic Sam was devised by Sam's bass player and childhood friend Mack Thompson at Sam's first recording session for Cobra as an approximation of \"Maghett Sam\".  The name Sam was using at the time, Good Rocking Sam, was already being used by another artist.<ref>Rowe, M (1981): ''Chicago Blues: the City and the Music''.  New York, Da Capo Press. pp. 178-179</ref>\n\n\"Magic Sam had a different guitar sound,\" said his record producer, [[Willie Dixon]]. \"Most of the guys were playing the straight 12-bar blues thing, but the harmonies that he carried with the chords was a different thing altogether. This tune \"All Your Love\", he expressed with such an inspirational feeling with his high voice. You could always tell him, even from his introduction to the music.\"<ref name=\"russell\">\n{{cite book\n| first= Tony\n| last= Russell\n| year= 1997\n| title= The Blues: From Robert Johnson to Robert Cray\n| edition= \n| publisher= Carlton Books Limited \n| location= Dubai\n| pages= 143\u2013144\n| isbn= 1-85868-255-X\n}}</ref>\n\n==Awards and recognition==\n* 1982 - [[Blues Foundation]] [[Blues Music Award]]: ''Magic Sam Live'' (Vintage or Reissue Album of the Year (US)).<ref>\n{{cite web\n  | title = 1982 Blues Music Awards\n  | publisher = The [[Blues Foundation]]\n  | url = http://www.blues.org/#ref=bluesmusicawards_pastyears\n  | accessdate = September 26, 2010\n}}</ref>\n* 1982 - Blues Foundation [[Blues Hall of Fame|Hall of Fame]]: Magic Sam inducted (Performer).<ref name=\"Blues HoF\">\n{{cite web\n  | title = 1982, 1984, 1990 Blues Hall of Fame Inductees\n  | publisher = The [[Blues Foundation]]\n  | url = http://www.blues.org/halloffame/inductees.php#ref=halloffame_inductees\n  | accessdate = September 26, 2010\n}}</ref>\n* 1984 - Blues Foundation Hall of Fame: ''[[West Side Soul]]'' (Classics of Blues Recordings - Albums category)<ref name=\"Blues HoF\"/>\n* 1990 - Blues Foundation Hall of Fame: ''[[Black Magic (Magic Sam album)|Black Magic]]'' (Classics of Blues Recordings - Albums category)<ref name=\"Blues HoF\"/>\n\n==Partial album discography==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Year\n!Title\n!Label\n!Comments\n|-\n|1967\n|''[[West Side Soul]]''\n|Delmark\n|recorded Chicago 1967 \n|-\n|1968\n|''[[Black Magic (Magic Sam album)|Black Magic]]''\n|Delmark\n|recorded Chicago 1968\n|-\n|1969\n|''Raw Blues Live 1969''\n|Rock Beat Records\n|recorded Berkeley, CA 1969\n|-\n|1980\n|''The Late Great Magic Sam''\n|L+R\n|recorded 1963&ndash;1964, 1969\n|-\n|1981\n|''Magic Sam Live''\n|Delmark\n|live recordings Chicago 1963&ndash;1964 & Ann Arbor 1969\n|-\n|1981\n|''Magic Touch''\n|Black Magic\n|live recording Chicago 1966\n|-\n|1989\n|''The Magic Sam Legacy''\n|Delmark\n|out-/alternate takes recorded Chicago 1967&ndash;1968\n|-\n|1991\n|''Give Me Time''\n|Delmark\n|solo demo/rehearsal home recordings 1968\n|-\n|2001\n|''With a Feeling &ndash; The Complete Cobra, Chief & Crash Recordings 1957&ndash;1966''\n|Westside\n|most pre-Delmark recordings; also available as ''Out of Luck'', P-Vine 2003\n|-\n|2002\n|''Rockin' Wild in Chicago''\n|Delmark\n|live recordings Chicago 1963, 1964, 1966, 1968\n|-\n|2013\n|''Live at the Avant Garde June 22, 1968''\n|Delmark\n|recorded live at the Avant Garde coffeehouse, Milwaukee, June 22, 1968\n|-\n|}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Authority control|VIAF=10035272}}\n{{Persondata <!-- Metadata: see [[Wikipedia:Persondata]]. -->\n| NAME              = Maghett, Samuel Gene\n| ALTERNATIVE NAMES = Magic Sam\n| SHORT DESCRIPTION = [[United States|American]] [[Chicago blues]] musician\n| DATE OF BIRTH     = February 14, 1937\n| PLACE OF BIRTH    = [[Grenada, Mississippi]], United States\n| DATE OF DEATH     = December 1, 1969\n| PLACE OF DEATH    = [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]], United States\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Magic Sam}}\n\n[[Category:1937 births]]\n[[Category:1969 deaths]]\n[[Category:Chicago blues musicians]]\n[[Category:Electric blues musicians]]\n[[Category:American blues guitarists]]\n[[Category:American blues singers]]\n[[Category:Blues Hall of Fame inductees]]\n[[Category:Blues musicians from Mississippi]]\n[[Category:Delmark Records artists]]\n[[Category:Deaths from myocardial infarction]]"}]}}}}
