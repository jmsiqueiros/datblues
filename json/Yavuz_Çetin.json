In 1984, at the age of 14, the adolescent music enthusiast was already taking blues and rock guitar lessons from guitarist [[Hasan Cihat \u00d6rter]] and, the following year, started learning to master the acoustic guitar and, subsequently, the [[electric guitar]]. Before graduating from [[Istanbul]]'s [[Haydarpa\u015fa]] High School, he and classmate Ercan Saat\u00e7i who, in later years, became a noted musician as well as sports journalist, entered ''HEY'' magazine's music competition and their song, \"I Will Cry\", became the winning entry.\n\nIn 1988, continuing his quest in Istanbul for higher education and advanced musical training, \u00c7etin began studies at [[Marmara University]]'s Music Department while earning an income as a musical performer in clubs such as Beyaz Ev [White House] in the port town of [[Bodrum]], where he played in 1989\u201390. In 1991, upon turning 21, he formed, with young musical colleagues Batu Mutlugil, Kerim \u00c7apl\u0131 and Sunay \u00d6zg\u00fcr, the musical group, Blue Blues Band.  Having married in 1992, Yavuz \u00c7etin and wife Didem filed for divorce four years later.  In that year, 1996, and for the remaining four years of his life, he was also a guitarist at the numerous concerts played by the noted band [[Mazhar-Fuat-\u00d6zkan]].\n\nHe collaborated, as well, on various albums with artists such as [[Teoman]], [[K\u0131ra\u00e7]], [[Sibel T\u00fcz\u00fcn]], [[Soner Ar\u0131ca]], [[G\u00f6ksel]], Deniz Arcak and Acil Servis. In G\u00f6ksel's hit song \"Sab\u0131r\", he became the first Turkish guitar player to use a [[talk box]].  Of particular note is his solo on Deniz Arcak's \"B\u0131rak\u0131n Beni\" from the ''K\u0131p\u0131r K\u0131p\u0131r'' album which, in an illustration of his mastery of the rock and blues guitar tradition, was recorded on the first take after only a couple of rehearsals.  It also became the last studio session recording in which he participated.\n\n==Two albums, ''\u0130lk'' and ''Sat\u0131l\u0131k''==\nIn 1997, Yavuz \u00c7etin issued his first album ''\u0130lk'', produced by his longtime compatriot Ercan Saat\u00e7i, but the album was unable to capture the spirit of that moment's public musical mood.  He also earned an income from writing numerous [[advertising jingle]]s, such as a well-remembered [[Coca-Cola]] spot, and his tune \"D\u00fcnya\" [\"the World\"], which was chosen as part of the soundtrack for the 1999 film, \"[[Propaganda (film)|Propaganda]]\", with a score composed and arranged by master guitarist [[Erkan O\u011fur]].\n\nSix weeks before his 31st birthday, after expending months of intense effort writing all of the tracks for his second album, ''Sat\u0131l\u0131k'', and having completed the album's final recording session, Yavuz \u00c7etin committed suicide by leaping from Istanbul's [[Bo\u011fazi\u00e7i Bridge]] which connects Europe and Asia across the [[Bosphorus]] strait.  Posthumous acclaim followed the subsequent release of the\u00a0album which a number of music reviewers described as a work of genius.  With the passage of years, both ''Sat\u0131l\u0131k'' and the previously overlooked ''\u0130lk ve Son...'' have gained a near-cult status as Yavuz \u00c7etin's music and words continue to be heard in the region keeping his legend alive for the listening public.\n\n==Discography==\n<div style=\"background-color:#DDDDDD; line-height:1.5; border-width : 2px; border-style:solid; border-color:#CCCCCC; font-size: small; font-color:#ffffff; margin-right : 5px; margin-left : 5px; margin-top : 35px; margin-bottom : 5px; font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica; padding: 5px;\">\n''\u0130lk'' (Stop Productions) (1997)\n</div>\n#Erke\u011fin Olmak \u0130stiyorum (I want to be your man)\n#Bilmem Neden \u0130nat Ettin (I don't know why you persisted)\n#Sahil (Coast)\n#Bodrum Gecesi Y\u00fcz\u00fcnden (Because of the Bodrum Night)\n#Kimse Bilemez (Nobody can know)\n#Gecenin Rengi (Colour of the Night)\n#A\u011flamay\u0131 Sevmem (I don't like crying)\n#\u00c7ok \u0130stiyorum (I want it so badly)\n#Onun \u015eark\u0131s\u0131 (Her Song)\n#Hisset Beni (Feel Me)\n#Fanki Tonki Zonki (Instrumental)\n#D\u00fcnya (The World)\n\n<div style=\"background-color:#DDDDDD; line-height:1.5; border-width : 2px; border-style:solid; border-color:#CCCCCC; font-size: small; font-color:#ffffff; margin-right : 5px; margin-left : 5px; margin-top : 5px; margin-bottom : 5px; font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica; padding: 5px;\">\n''Sat\u0131l\u0131k'' (Tmc M\u00fczik) (2001)\n</div>\n#Cherokee\n#Benimle U\u00e7mak \u0130ster misin?
