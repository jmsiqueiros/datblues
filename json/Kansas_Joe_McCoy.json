Born in [[Raymond, Mississippi]], he was the older [[sibling|brother]] of the blues accompanist [[Papa Charlie McCoy]]. As a young man, McCoy was drawn to the music scene in [[Memphis, Tennessee]] where he played [[guitar]] and sang vocals during the 1920s. He teamed up with future wife Lizzie Douglas, a guitarist better known as [[Memphis Minnie]], and their 1929 recording of the song \"Bumble Bee\" on the [[Columbia Records]] [[record label|label]] was a [[hit record|hit]].<ref>Garon, Paul. ''Woman With Guitar: Memphis Minnie's Blues'', Da Capo Press, page 25, (1992) - ISBN 0-306-80460-3</ref> In 1930, the couple moved to [[Chicago]] where they were an important part of the burgeoning blues scene. Following their divorce, McCoy teamed up with his brother to form a band known as the [[Harlem Hamfats]] that performed and recorded during the second half of the 1930s. \n\nIn 1936, the Harlem Hamfats released a [[gramophone record|record]] with the song \"The Weed Smoker's Dream\" on it. McCoy later refined the tune, changed the lyrics and titled the new song \"[[Why Don't You Do Right?]]\" for [[Lil Green]], who recorded it in 1941. It was [[cover version|covered]] a year later by both [[Benny Goodman]] and [[Peggy Lee]], becoming Lee's first [[hit single]]. \"Why Don't You Do Right?\" remains a [[jazz standard]] and is McCoy's most enduring composition. \n\nAt the outbreak of [[World War II]] Charlie McCoy entered the military, but a heart condition kept Joe McCoy from service. Out on his own, he created a band known as 'Big Joe and his Rhythm' that performed together throughout most of the 1940s. The band featured [[Robert Lee McCollum|Robert Nighthawk]] on [[harmonica]] and Charlie on [[mandolin]].<ref name=\"russell\"/> In 1950, at the age of 44, McCoy died of [[heart disease]] in Chicago, only a few months before Charlie. They are both buried in [[Burr Oak Cemetery and Restvale Cemetery|Restvale Cemetery]] in [[Alsip, Illinois]].\n\n[[Led Zeppelin]] vocalist [[Robert Plant]] took his and Memphis Minnie's recording of \"[[When the Levee Breaks]],\" which was in his personal collection, and presented it to guitarist [[Jimmy Page]], who revamped it and slightly altered it lyrically, and helped record it on Led Zeppelin's 1971 album, ''[[Led Zeppelin IV]]''.\n\nMcCoy's songs have also been covered by [[Bob Dylan]], [[John Mellencamp]], [[The Ink Spots]], [[Ella Fitzgerald]], [[Jo Ann Kelly]], [[Cleo Laine]] and [[A Perfect Circle]].\n\n==Pseudonyms==\nMcCoy also performed and recorded under the names Bill Wither, Georgia Pine Boy, Hallelujah Joe, Big Joe McCoy and His Washboard Band, and The Mississippi Mudder.<ref name=\"russell\">{{cite book\n| first= Tony\n| last= Russell\n| year= 1997\n| title= The Blues: From Robert Johnson to Robert Cray\n| edition= \n| publisher= Carlton Books Limited \n| location= Dubai\n| pages= 140\u201341\n| isbn= 1-85868-255-X}}</ref> He also used the names Hamfoot Ham, Hillbilly Plowboy, and Mud Dauber Joe.<ref name=\"amg\"/>\n\n==Posthumous recognition==\nLike many blues musicians of his era, Joe McCoy's grave site was originally unmarked.
