He formed his own trio in 1958.\n\nIt was not until 1963 that his record label allowed him to release an album entirely of vocals.

However, it was an original composition in the album that brought him the most attention \u2013 \"[[Parchman Farm (song)|Parchman Farm]]\". For more than two decades, \"Parchman Farm\" was his most requested song. He dropped it from his playlist in the 1980s because some critics felt it was politically incorrect.
