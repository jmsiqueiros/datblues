He appeared as an accompanist on dozens of [[sound recording and reproduction|recordings]] for blues [[musician|artists]] over five decades.  He began his career as a [[Drum kit|drummer]] for [[Elmore James]], but was most famous as a blues vocalist and [[Richter-tuned harmonica|blues harp]] player. For nearly two decades he was the featured vocalist for [[Anson Funderburgh]] & The Rockets.\n\n==Biography==\n'''Samuel Joseph Myers'''<ref name=\"Dead\"/> was born in [[Laurel, Mississippi|Laurel]], [[Mississippi]].  He acquired juvenile cataracts at age 7 and was left legally blind for the rest of his life despite corrective surgery. He could make out shapes and shadows, but could not read print at all; he was taught Braille.<ref>\"Sam Myers: The Blues Is My Story\"</ref>  Myers acquired an interest in music while a schoolboy in [[Jackson, Mississippi]] and became skilled enough at playing the [[trumpet]] and [[drum]]s that he received a non-degree scholarship from the [[American Conservatory of Music]] (formerly named the American Conservatory School of Music) in [[Chicago]]. Myers attended school by day and at night frequented the nightclubs of the [[South Side, Chicago]]. There he met and was sitting in with [[Jimmy Rogers]], [[Muddy Waters]], [[Howling Wolf]], [[Little Walter]], [[Hound Dog Taylor]], [[Robert Lockwood, Jr.]], and [[Elmore James]]. Myers played drums with Elmore James on a fairly steady basis from 1952 until James's death in 1963, and is credited on many of James's historic recordings for [[Chess Records]]. In 1956, Myers wrote and recorded what was to be his most famous single, \"Sleeping In The Ground\", a song that has been [[cover version|covered]] by [[Eric Clapton]], [[Robert Cray]], and many other blues artists, as well as being featured on [[Bob Dylan]]'s [[Theme Time Radio Hour]] show on 'Sleep'.\n\nFrom the early 1960s until 1986, Myers worked the clubs in and around Jackson, as well as across the South in the (formerly) [[Racial segregation|racially segregated]] string of venues dubbed the [[Chitlin' circuit|Chitlin' Circuit]].

Myers toured all over the [[United States|U.S.]] and the world with The Rockets, enjoying a partnership that endured until the time of his death, from complications from [[Head and neck cancer|throat cancer]] surgery on July 17, 2006, in [[Dallas]], [[Texas]].<ref name=\"Dead\">[http://thedeadrockstarsclub.com/2006b.html Thedeadrockstarsclub.com - accessed December 2009]</ref>\n\nJust before Myers died, he toured as a solo artist, in [[Sweden]], [[Norway]] and [[Denmark]], with the Swedish band, Bloosblasters.<ref>[http://www.bloosblasters.se Bloosblasters.se]</ref> \n\nThat same year, the ''[[University Press of Mississippi]]'' published Myers' autobiography titled ''Sam Myers: The Blues is My Story''.
