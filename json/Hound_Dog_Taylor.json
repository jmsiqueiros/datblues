He originally played [[piano]], but began playing [[guitar]] when he was 20. He moved to Chicago in 1942.\n\nHe became a full-time musician around 1957 but remained unknown outside of the Chicago area where he played small clubs in the black neighborhoods and also at the open-air [[Maxwell Street]] Market. He was known for his electrified [[slide guitar]] playing roughly styled after that of [[Elmore James]], his cheap Japanese [[Teisco]] guitars, and his raucous boogie beats. He was also famed among guitar players for having six fingers on his left hand.<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.tdblues.com/?p=556\n|title=Hound Dog Taylor \u2013 Everyone Knows the Hound\n|publisher=The Delta Blues\n|accessdate=2010-12-18 \n}}</ref> \n\nAfter hearing Taylor with his band, the HouseRockers ([[Brewer Phillips]] on second guitar and Ted Harvey on drums) in 1970 at Florence's Lounge on Chicago's South Side, [[Bruce Iglauer]] - at the time a shipping clerk for [[Delmark Records]] - tried to get him signed by his employer.<ref name=\"russell\">{{cite book\n| first= Tony\n| last= Russell\n| year= 1997\n| title= The Blues - From [[Robert Johnson (musician)|Robert Johnson]] to [[Robert Cray]]\n| edition= \n| publisher=Carlton Books Limited \n| location= Dubai\n| pages= 174\u2013175\n| isbn= 1-85868-255-X}}</ref> Having no success getting Delmark to sign Taylor, Iglauer formed a small record label with a $2500 inheritance and recorded Taylor's debut album, ''[[Hound Dog Taylor and the HouseRockers]]'', on his fledgling [[Alligator Records]] in 1971.<ref name=\"russell\"/> It was the first release on Alligator, now a major blues label.<ref name=\"AMG\"/>  It was recorded in a studio in just two nights. Iglauer began managing and booking the band, which toured nationwide and performed with [[Muddy Waters]] and [[Big Mama Thornton]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} The band became particularly popular in the Boston area, where Taylor inspired a young prot\u00e9g\u00e9 named [[George Thorogood]].  A live album ''Live At Joe's Place'' documented a Boston appearance from 1972.\n\nTheir second release, ''Natural Boogie'', was recorded in late 1973, and led to greater acclaim and touring. In 1975, Taylor and his band toured Australia and New Zealand with [[Freddie King]] and [[Sonny Terry]] and [[Brownie McGhee]].  His third Alligator album, ''Beware of the Dog'', was recorded live in 1974 but was only released after his death.<ref name=\"AMG\"/> More posthumous releases occurred as well, including ''Genuine Houserocking Music'' and ''Release the Hound'', on the Alligator label as well as some bootleg live recordings. \n\nTaylor died of lung cancer in 1975, and was buried in Restvale Cemetery in [[Alsip, Illinois]].<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.furious.com/perfect/hounddogtaylor.html\n|title=Hound Dog Taylor\n|publisher=\n|accessdate=2006-11-22 \n}}</ref><ref>[http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&GRid=9499 Find-A-Grave biography Findagrave.com]</ref>\n\nTaylor was posthumously inducted into the [[Blues Hall of Fame]] in 1984.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}\n\n[[George Thorogood]] dedicated \"[[The Sky Is Crying (song)|The Sky Is Crying]]\" (song 9) to \"the memory of the late great Hound Dog Taylor\" on his ''Live'' album (EMI America CDP 7 46329 2).\n\n==Discography==\n*''[[Hound Dog Taylor and the HouseRockers]]' (1971)(Alligator Records)\n*''[[Natural Boogie (Album)|Natural Boogie]]'' (1974)(Alligator Records)\n*''Beware of the Dog!''
