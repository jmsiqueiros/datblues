King]]'s mother (White's mother and King's grandmother were sisters).<ref>{{cite book |title=The B.B. King Reader: 6 Decades of Commentary |editor1-first=Richard |editor1-last= Kostelanetz |editor2-first=Jesse |editor2-last=Reiswig |edition=2nd |year=2005 |publisher=Hal Leonard |location=Milwaukee, WI |isbn=0634099272 |page=4 }}</ref> White himself is remembered as a player of [[National String Instrument Corporation|National]] [[steel guitar]]s. He also played, but was less adept at, the [[piano]].\n\nWhite started his career playing the [[fiddle]] at [[square dance]]s. He claims to have met [[Charlie Patton]] early on, although some doubt has been cast upon this;<ref>Stephen Calt claims, in his book about Skip James: ''I'd Rather Be the Devil'', that White claimed to know Patton merely because Fahey was a fan of the long dead bluesman.</ref> Regardless, Patton was a large influence on White. White typically played [[slide guitar]], in an [[Open Tuning|open tuning]]. He was one of the few, along with [[Skip James]], to use a [[Guitar tunings#Minor Open Tunings/Cross-note tunings|crossnote tuning]] in [[E minor]], which he may have learned, as James did, from [[Bentonia School (blues)|Henry Stuckey]].\n\nHe first [[sound recording and reproduction|recorded]] for the [[Victor Records]] label in 1930. His recordings for Victor, like those of many other bluesmen, fluctuated between [[country blues]] and [[Gospel music|gospel]] numbers.  Victor published his photograph in 1930.  His gospel songs were done in the style of [[Blind Willie Johnson]], with a female singer accentuating the last phrase of each line.<ref>In the liner notes for ''American Primitive, Vol. 1'', which features White's ''I am in the Heavenly Way,'' Fahey states that White \"...had no particular interest in religion. Victor went and hired the woman from a local Baptist church for this recording. Trying to imitate Blind Willie Johnson.\"</ref>\n\nNine years later, while serving time for assault, he recorded for folklorist [[John Lomax]].  The few songs he recorded around this time became his most well-known: \"[[Shake 'Em on Down]],\" and \"[[Poor Boy Blues|Po' Boy]].\"\n\n[[Bob Dylan]] covered his song \"[[Fixin' to Die Blues]]\", which aided a \"rediscovery\" of White in 1963 by guitarist [[John Fahey (musician)|John Fahey]] and [[ED Denson]], which  propelled him onto the [[folk revival]] scene of the 1960s. White had recorded the song simply because his other songs had not particularly impressed the Victor [[record producer]]. It was a studio composition of which White had thought little until it re-emerged thirty years later.<ref>''I'd Rather Be the Devil: Skip James and the Blues'' by Stephen Calt, p. 243</ref>\n\nWhite was at one time managed by experienced blues manager Arne Brogger. Fahey and Denson found White easily enough: Fahey wrote a letter to \"Bukka White (Old Blues Singer), c/o General Delivery, [[Aberdeen, Mississippi]].\" Fahey had assumed, given White's song, \"Aberdeen, Mississippi\", that White still lived there, or nearby. The postcard was forwarded to [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]], [[Tennessee]], where White worked in a tank factory. Fahey and Denson soon traveled to meet White, and White  and Fahey remained friends through the remainder of White's life.<ref>In his collection of autobiographical sketches, ''How Bluegrass Music Ruined My Life'', John Fahey reminisces about his and White's time catching catfish together. He also remarks that White had, by the time of his rediscovery, largely forgotten how to play guitar, but had become an even more adept lyricist.</ref>  He recorded a new [[album]] for Denson and Fahey's [[Takoma Records]], whilst Denson became his [[management|manager]].\n\nWhite was, later in life, also friends with fellow [[musician]] [[Furry Lewis]]. The two recorded, mostly in Lewis' Memphis [[apartment]], an album together, ''Furry Lewis, Bukka White & Friends: Party! At Home''. \n[[File:ParchmanGateNewPhoto.JPG|thumb|\"Parchman Farm Blues\" was about the [[Mississippi State Penitentiary]]]]\nOne of his most famous songs, \"Parchman Farm Blues\", about the [[Mississippi State Penitentiary]] (also known as Parchman Farm) in [[Sunflower County, Mississippi]], was released on [[Harry Everett Smith|Harry Smith]]'s fourth volume of the ''[[Anthology of American Folk Music, Vol. 4]]''. The song was covered by The Traits/aka [[Roy Head]] and the Traits with [[Johnny Winter]] in the late 1960s.  His 1937 version of the oft-recorded song,<ref>Furry Lewis, [[Mississippi Fred McDowell]], [[Wade Walton]], and [[R. L. Burnside]] have all recorded version of \"Shake 'Em On Down\", as have countless others.</ref> \"Shake 'Em On Down,\" is considered definitive, and became a hit while White was serving time in Parchman.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.answers.com/topic/bukka-white |title=Bukka White: Information from |publisher=Answers.com |date= |accessdate=2012-12-09}}</ref> \n\nWhite died in February 1977 from [[cancer]], at the age of 67, in [[Memphis, Tennessee]].<ref name=\"Death\"/><ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.allaboutjazz.com/php/musician.php?id=11306 |title=Musician Bukka White (Guitar, slide) @ All About Jazz |publisher=Allaboutjazz.com |date= |accessdate=2012-12-09}}</ref> In 1990 he was posthumously inducted into the [[Blues Hall of Fame]] (along with [[Blind Blake]] and [[Lonnie Johnson (musician)|Lonnie Johnson]]).  \nOn November 21, 2011, The [[Recording Academy]] announced that \"[[Fixin' to Die Blues]]\" was to be added to its 2012 list of [[Grammy Hall of Fame Award]] recipients.<ref>[http://www.grammy.org/recording-academy/press-release/nov-21-2011-500-am]</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\n[[File:Bukka White sign.jpg|thumb|left|Memorial marker for Bukka White]]\n\nThe [[Led Zeppelin]] song \"[[Hats Off to (Roy) Harper]]\", on the band's [[1970 in music|1970]] album [[Led Zeppelin III]] was based in large part on White's \"[[Shake 'Em on Down]].\"<ref name=Complete>Dave Lewis (1994), ''The Complete Guide to the Music of Led Zeppelin'', Omnibus Press, ISBN 0-7119-3528-9.</ref> \"[[Custard Pie]]\", a song on [[Led Zeppelin]]'s [[1975 in music|1975]] album [[Physical Graffiti]], also references \"[[Shake 'Em on Down]].\"<ref name=Complete/>\n\nThe 1963 recordings of White's song \"Shake 'em on Down\" and spoken-word piece \"Remembrance of Charlie Patton\" were both [[Sampling (music)|sampled]] by [[electronic (music)|electronic]] artist [[Recoil (band)|Recoil]] (mostly a one-man effort by Alan Wilder of [[Depeche Mode]]) for the track \"Electro Blues For Bukka White\" on the 1992 album ''[[Bloodline (Recoil album)|Bloodline]]''.
