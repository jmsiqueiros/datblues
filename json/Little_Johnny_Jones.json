Cohan]].  The show introduced Cohan's tunes \"[[Give My Regards to Broadway]]\" and \"[[The Yankee Doodle Boy]].\" The \"Yankee Doodle\" character was inspired by real-life  [[National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame|Hall of Fame]] [[jockey]] [[Tod Sloan (jockey)|Tod Sloan]].\n\n==Background==\nThe show was Cohan's first full-length musical.  A famous American jockey, [[Tod Sloan (jockey)|Tod Sloan]], had gone to England in 1903 to ride in the Derby for King [[Edward VII]] of England.  This gave Cohan the idea for the story.  The musical is patriotic in tone and contains a number of quips aimed at European targets, such as, \"You think I'd marry an heiress and live off her money? What do you take me for? An Englishman?\"  and, \"French pastry ain't worth 30\u00a2 compared to American apple pie.\"  In ''Little Johnny Jones'' Cohan introduced some of the dance steps and comedy features for which he would become famous.<ref>[http://www.theatrehistory.com/american/cohan001.html Information about Cohan and the show]</ref>\n\nThis musical is also credited as being the first American Musical, along \"with ''[[The Black Crook]]'', ''Evangeline'', ''[[Show Boat]]'', ''[[The Beggar's Opera]]'', ''[[The Wizard of the Nile]]'', or any number of other works.\"<ref>Everett, William A. and Laird, Paul R.

Jones falls in love with Goldie Gates, a San Francisco copper heiress, who follows him to Britain, disguising herself as a man to discover if Jones really loves her.  Anthony Anstey, an American who runs a Chinese gambling establishment in [[San Francisco]], offers Jones a bribe to lose the race deliberately, but he refuses.  After Jones loses, Anstey spreads rumors that he threw the race intentionally.  Jones' detective, pretending to be a drunkard, searches for evidence to clear Johnny's name and finds out that it was Anstey that framed Jones.  Jones tells his friends who are returning to America, \"Give My Regards to Broadway,\" but he stays in London to try to regain his reputation.  Jones returns to America with his name cleared, eager to propose marriage to Goldie, but he finds that Anstey has kidnapped her.  He and his detective search for her in San Francisco's Chinatown, eventually finding her.\n\n==Original production==\nThe musical was first tried out at the Parsons Theatre in [[Hartford, Connecticut]] in October 1904 and then opened on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] at the [[Liberty Theatre]] on November 7, 1904.  The original production was produced by [[Sam Harris (playwright)|Sam H. Harris]] and directed by [[George M. Cohan]] who also performed as part of the cast with the other members of The Four Cohans (Cohan, his parents and sister).  [[Ethel Levey]], Cohan's wife, co-starred.<ref>[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/diglib/ihas/loc.natlib.ihas.200000020/default.html Information about The Four Cohans, Levey and the show]</ref>  Among the other performers were [[William Seymour (actor)|William Seymour]] and [[Donald Brian]].  The Broadway run of only 52 performances was followed by tours, during which some rewrites were made.  It was revived twice in 1905 at the [[Olympia Theatre (New York)|New York Theatre]], playing successfully for over 200 performances through most of that year, and touring until the next Broadway revival in 1907 for a short run at the Academy of Music.  The production was mounted with a huge cast.<ref>[http://digitalgallery.nypl.org/nypldigital/dgkeysearchdetail.cfm?trg=1&strucID=192980&imageID=G99B742_002&word=Nyvall%20Press&s=3&notword=&d=&c=&f=4&lWord=&lField=&sScope=&sLevel=&sLabel=&total=15&num=0&imgs=12&pNum=&pos=2# Information from the 1907 pamphlet]</ref>\n\n==Subsequent adaptations and productions==\n''Little Johnny Jones'' was adapted twice for the motion pictures, first as a silent film released in 1924 by Warner Bros.<ref>[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0014204/ IMDB page on the 1923 film]</ref> [[First National]] followed this in 1929 with an early talkie musical version directed by [[Mervyn LeRoy]], who played a bit part in the 1924 film.  [[Edward Buzzell|Eddie Buzzell]], who co-wrote the screenplay with Adelaide Heilbron, played the title role.  Only two of Cohan's original songs survived the transition to the screen (\"Give My Regards To Broadway\" and \"Yankee Doodle Boy\").
