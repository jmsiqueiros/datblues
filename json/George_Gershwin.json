Among his best known works are the orchestral compositions ''[[Rhapsody in Blue]]'' (1924) and ''[[An American in Paris]]'' (1928), as well as the opera ''[[Porgy and Bess]]'' (1935).\n\nGershwin studied piano under Charles Hambitzer and composition with [[Rubin Goldmark]] and [[Henry Cowell]]. He began his career as a [[song plugger]], but soon started composing [[Broadway theatre]] works with his brother [[Ira Gershwin]] and [[Buddy DeSylva]]. He moved to [[Paris]] to study with [[Nadia Boulanger]], where he began to compose ''An American in Paris''. After returning to [[New York City]], he wrote ''Porgy and Bess'' with Ira and the author [[DuBose Heyward]]. Initially a commercial failure, ''Porgy and Bess'' is now considered one of the most important American operas of the twentieth century. Gershwin moved to Hollywood and composed numerous [[film score]]s until his death in 1937 from a [[brain tumor]].\n\nGershwin's compositions have been adapted for use in many films and for television, and several became jazz standards recorded in many variations. Many celebrated singers and musicians have covered his songs.\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early life===\nGershwin came from [[History of the Jews in Russia|Russian Jewish]] heritage. His grandfather, Jakov Gershowitz, had served for 25 years as a mechanic for the [[Imperial Russian Army]] to earn the right of free travel and residence as a Jew. He retired near [[Saint Petersburg]]. His teenage son, Moishe Gershowitz, worked as a leather cutter for women's shoes; Moishe fell in love with Roza Bruskina, the teenage daughter of a Saint Petersburg furrier. Bruskina moved with her family to New York because of increasing antisemitism in Russia; she Americanized her first name to Rose. Moishe, faced with compulsory military service in Russia, followed Rose as soon as he was able. Upon arrival in New York, Moishe Gershowitz gave his first name as Morris. He settled at first with his mother's brother in Brooklyn, a tailor named Greenstein, and earned money as a foreman in a women's shoe workshop. When Morris and Rose married on July 21, 1895, she was 19 and he was 23. Gershowitz changed his family name to Gershwin some time between 1893 and 1898, perhaps at his marriage.<ref>Hyland, pp.1\u20133</ref><ref>Pollack, Howard. ''George Gershwin.

Morris moved his family to Brooklyn, a second-floor dwelling at 242 Snediker Avenue. George Gershwin was born there on September 26, 1898; his birth certificate bears the name Jacob Gershwine, which would have been pronounced 'Gershvin' in the ex-pat Russian neighborhood. The boy was named for his late grandfather, the army mechanic. However, he was not called anything but 'George'. (Years later, George changed the spelling of his surname to 'Gershwin' after he became a professional musician; other members of his family followed suit.)<ref name=Jablonski29/><ref>Pollack p. 10</ref>\n\nGeorge and Ira lived in many different residences as their father changed dwellings with each new enterprise he became involved with. Mostly, the boys grew up around the [[Yiddish Theater District]]. They frequented the local Yiddish theaters, with George running errands for members and appearing onstage as an [[Extra (actor)|extra]].<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=RySwdc151ZoC&pg=PA43 |title=George Gershwin: His Life and Work |author=Howard Pollack |publisher= University of California Press|year= 2006}}</ref><ref name=\"google1\">{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=3ClbSVEha8gC&pg=PT199 |title=The Rough Guide to New York City |author=Andrew Rosenberg, Martin Dunford |publisher=Penguin |year= 2012}}</ref><ref name=\"latimes1998\">[http://articles.latimes.com/1998/oct/20/entertainment/ca-34192 \"Reviving, Revisiting Yiddish Culture\"], Mark Swed, ''LA Times'', October 20, 1998</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/loc/Gershwin.html |title=Judaic Treasures of the Library of Congress: George Gershwin |publisher=Jewish Virtual Library |year=2013 |accessdate=March 10, 2013}} As quoted from Abraham J.

George ran around with his boyhood friends, roller skating and misbehaving in the streets.

His parents had bought a piano for lessons for his older brother [[Ira Gershwin|Ira]], but to his parents' surprise and Ira's relief, it was George who played it.<ref>Hyland, p. 13</ref> Although his younger sister [[Frances Gershwin]] was the first in the family to make money from her musical talents, she married young and devoted herself to being a mother and housewife. She gave up her performing career, but settled into painting as a creative outlet; painting was also a hobby of George Gershwin. Brother [[Arthur Gershwin]] also became a composer of songs, musicals, and short piano works.\n\nGershwin tried various piano teachers for two years, before being introduced to Charles Hambitzer by Jack Miller, the pianist in the Beethoven Symphony Orchestra. Until Hambitzer's death in 1918, he acted as Gershwin's mentor. Hambitzer taught Gershwin conventional piano technique, introduced him to music of the European classical tradition, and encouraged him to attend orchestra concerts.<ref>Hyland, p. 14</ref> At home, following such concerts, young Gershwin would try to play at the piano the music that he had heard. He later studied with the classical composer [[Rubin Goldmark]] and avant-garde composer-theorist [[Henry Cowell]].\n\n===Tin Pan Alley===\n{|align=right\n|{{Listen\n|filename=Al Jolson, George Gershwin, Irving Caesar, Swanee 1920.ogg\n|title=Swanee\n|description=[[Al Jolson]]'s hit 1920 recording of George Gershwin and [[Irving Caesar]]'s 1919 \"[[Swanee (song)|Swanee]]\".\n|format=[[Ogg]]}}\n|}\nOn leaving school at the age of 15, Gershwin found his first job as a \"[[song plugger]]\" for Jerome H. Remick and Company, a publishing firm on New York City's [[Tin Pan Alley]], where he earned $15 a week. His first published song was \"When You Want 'Em, You Can't Get 'Em, When You've Got 'Em, You Don't Want 'Em\". It was published in 1916 when Gershwin was only 17 years old and earned him $5. His 1917 novelty [[Ragtime|rag]], \"Rialto Ripples\", was a commercial success, and in 1919 he scored his first big national hit with his song, \"[[Swanee (song)|Swanee]]\", with words by [[Irving Caesar]]. [[Al Jolson]], a famous [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] singer of the day, heard Gershwin perform \"Swanee\" at a party and decided to sing it in one of his shows.<ref>{{cite book|last=Venezia|first=Mike|title=Getting to Know the World's Greatest Composers: George Gerswhin|year=1994|publisher=Childrens Press|location=Chicago IL}}</ref>\n\nIn 1916, Gershwin started working for Aeolian Company and Standard Music Rolls in New York, recording and arranging. He produced dozens, if not hundreds, of rolls under his own and assumed names. (Pseudonyms attributed to Gershwin include Fred Murtha and Bert Wynn.) He also recorded rolls of his own compositions for the Duo-Art and [[Welte-Mignon]] [[reproducing piano]]s. As well as recording piano rolls, Gershwin made a brief foray into [[vaudeville]], accompanying both [[Nora Bayes]] and [[Louise Dresser]] on the piano.<ref>Slide, Anthony. ''The Encyclopedia of Vaudeville'', Westport, Connecticut: Greenwood Press, 1994. p. 111.</ref>\n\nIn the late 1910s, Gershwin met songwriter and music director [[William Merrigan Daly|William Daly]]. The two collaborated on the Broadway musicals ''Piccadilly to Broadway'' (1920) and ''For Goodness' Sake'' (1922), and jointly composed the score for ''Our Nell'' (1923). This was the beginning of a long friendship; Daly was a frequent arranger, orchestrator and conductor of Gershwin's music, and Gershwin periodically turned to him for musical advice.<ref>Pollack, pp. 191\u2013192</ref>\n\nIn the early 1920s, Gershwin frequently worked with the lyricist [[Buddy DeSylva]]. Together they created the experimental one-act jazz opera ''[[Blue Monday (opera)|Blue Monday]],'' set in Harlem. It is widely regarded as a forerunner to the groundbreaking ''[[Porgy and Bess]]''.  In 1924, George and Ira Gershwin collaborated on a stage musical comedy ''[[Lady Be Good (musical)|Lady Be Good]]'', which included such future [[Jazz standards|standards]] as \"[[Fascinating Rhythm]]\" and \"[[Oh, Lady Be Good!]]\".<ref>{{ibdb show|title=Lady, Be Good|id=5227}}.

It was orchestrated by [[Ferde Grof\u00e9]] and premiered by [[Paul Whiteman]]'s concert band in New York. It proved to be his most popular work.\n\nIn the mid-1920s, Gershwin stayed in Paris for a short period of time, during which he applied to study composition with the noted [[Nadia Boulanger]] who, along with several other prospective tutors such as [[Maurice Ravel]], rejected him. She was afraid that rigorous classical study would ruin his [[jazz]]-influenced style.<ref>Jablonski pp.155\u2013170</ref> While there, Gershwin wrote ''[[An American in Paris]]''. This work received mixed reviews upon its first performance at [[Carnegie Hall]] on December 13, 1928, but it quickly became part of the standard repertoire in Europe and the United States.<ref>Jablonski, pp.178\u2013180</ref> Growing tired of the Parisian musical scene, Gershwin returned to the United States.\n\nIn 1929, Gershwin was contracted by [[Fox Film Corporation]] to compose the score for the movie ''[[Delicious (film)|Delicious]]''. Only two pieces were used in the final film, the five-minute \"Dream Sequence\" and the six-minute \"Manhattan Rhapsody\", which in expanded form was later published as the ''[[Second Rhapsody]]''. Gershwin became infuriated when the rest of the score was rejected by [[Fox Film Corporation]], and it would be seven years before he worked in Hollywood again.\n\n===Opera===\nGershwin's first opera, [[Blue Monday (opera)|''Blue Monday'']], is a short one-act opera which was not a financial success and has only received limited performances. Gershwin's most ambitious composition was ''[[Porgy and Bess]]'' (1935). Gershwin called it a \"folk opera\", and it is now widely regarded as one of the most important American operas of the twentieth century.\n\"From the very beginning, it was considered another American classic by the composer of 'Rhapsody in Blue'\u2014even if critics couldn't quite figure out how to evaluate it. Was it opera, or was it simply an ambitious Broadway musical? 'It crossed the barriers,' says theater historian Robert Kimball. 'It wasn't a musical work per se, and it wasn't a drama per se \u2013 it elicited response from both music and drama critics. But the work has sort of always been outside category.\"<ref>Grigsby Bates, Karen.[http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4951238 70 Years of Gershwin's 'Porgy and Bess'\"] npr.org, October 10, 2005</ref>\n\nBased on the novel ''[[Porgy (novel)|Porgy]]'' by [[DuBose Heyward]], the action takes place in the fictional all-black neighborhood of Catfish Row in [[Charleston, South Carolina]]. With the exception of several minor speaking roles, all of the characters are black. The music combines elements of popular music of the day, with a strong influence of Black music, with techniques typical of opera, such as [[recitative]], [[through-composition]] and an extensive system of [[leitmotif]]s. ''Porgy and Bess'' contains some of Gershwin's most sophisticated music, including a [[fugue]], a [[passacaglia]], the use of [[atonality]], [[polytonality]] and [[polyrhythm]], and a [[tone row]]. Even the \"set numbers\" (of which \"[[Summertime (song)|Summertime]]\", \"I Got Plenty o' Nuttin'\" and \"[[It Ain't Necessarily So]]\" are well known examples) are some of the most refined and ingenious of Gershwin's output. For the performances, Gershwin collaborated with [[Eva Jessye]], whom he picked as the musical director. One of the outstanding musical alumnae of [[Western University (Kansas)|Western University]] in [[Kansas]], she had created her own choir in New York and performed widely with them. The work was first performed in 1935; it was a box office failure.\n\n===Last years===\nAfter the commercial failure of ''Porgy and Bess'', Gershwin moved to [[Hollywood, Los Angeles|Hollywood]], California. He was commissioned by [[RKO Pictures]] in 1936 to write the music for the film ''[[Shall We Dance (1937 film)|Shall We Dance]]'', starring [[Fred Astaire]] and [[Ginger Rogers]]. Gershwin's extended score, which would marry ballet with [[jazz]] in a new way, runs over an hour in length. It took Gershwin several months to write and orchestrate it.\n\nGershwin had a ten-year affair with composer [[Kay Swift]], whom he frequently consulted about his music. The two never married, although she eventually divorced her husband [[James Warburg]] in order to make it possible. Swift's granddaughter, Katharine Weber, has suggested that the pair were not married because George's mother Rose was \"unhappy that Kay Swift wasn't Jewish\".<ref>{{cite news|author=Sidney Offit|url=http://momentmag.com/moment/issues/2011/10/book_memory.html|title=Sins of Our Fathers (and Grandmothers)|work=Moment Magazine|date=September\u2013October 2011|accessdate=October 3, 2011}}</ref> ''Oh, Kay'' was named for her.<ref>Hyland p.108</ref> After Gershwin's death, Swift arranged some of his music, transcribed several of his recordings, and collaborated with his brother Ira on several projects.<ref>[http://www.kayswift.com/bio.html ''Kay Swift biography'' (Kay Swift Memorial Trust)]. kayswift.com. Retrieved December 28, 2007.</ref>\n\nEarly in 1937, Gershwin began to complain of blinding headaches and a recurring impression that he smelled burning rubber. On February 11, 1937, Gershwin performed his Piano Concerto in F in a special concert of his music with the [[San Francisco Symphony|San Francisco Symphony Orchestra]] under the direction of French maestro [[Pierre Monteux]].<ref>Pollack, p. 353</ref> Gershwin, normally a superb pianist in his own compositions, suffered coordination problems and blackouts during the performance. He was at the time living with his brother Ira and Ira's wife Leonore in a rented house in [[Beverly Hills]] while they worked on other Hollywood film projects. Leonore Gershwin began to be disturbed by George's mood swings and seeming inability to eat without spilling food at the dinner table. She suspected the onset of mental illness and she insisted he be moved out of their house to lyricist [[Yip Harburg]]'s empty quarters nearby where he was placed in the care of his valet, Paul Mueller. The headaches and olfactory hallucinations continued and on June 23, after an incident in which Gershwin tried to push Mueller out of the car in which they were riding, Gershwin was admitted to Cedars of Lebanon Hospital in Los Angeles for observation. Tests showed no physical cause and he was released on the 26th with a diagnosis of \"likely hysteria\". His troubles with coordination and mental acuity worsened, and on the night of July 9, Gershwin collapsed in Harburg's house where he had been working on the score of ''[[The Goldwyn Follies]]''. He was rushed back to Cedars of Lebanon<ref name=\"Jablonski\">Jablonski, Edward. \"George Gershwin; He Couldn't Be Saved\" (Letter to Editor), ''The New York Times'', October 25, 1998, Section 2; Page 4; Column 5</ref> where he fell into a coma. Only at that point did it become obvious to his doctors that he was suffering from a brain tumor. An immediate call was made to pioneering neurosurgeon Dr. [[Harvey Cushing]] in Boston who, retired for several years by then, recommended Dr. [[Walter Dandy]], who was on a boat fishing in Chesapeake Bay with the Governor of Maryland. Dandy was quickly brought to shore by the Coast Guard and sent on to Newark Airport to catch a plane to Los Angeles; however, by that time Gershwin's condition was judged to be critical and the need for surgery immediate. An attempt by doctors at Cedars to excise the tumor was made in the early hours of the 11th, but it proved unsuccessful, and Gershwin died on the morning of July 11, 1937 at the age of 38.\n\nGershwin's many friends and fans were shocked and devastated. [[John O'Hara]] remarked: \"George Gershwin died on July 11, 1937, but I don't have to believe it if I don't want to.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.broadstreetreview.com/index.php/main/article/Gershwins_unrealized_potential/ |title=Broad Street |publisher=Broadstreetreview.com |date=February 27, 2007 |accessdate=March 10, 2010}}</ref> He was interred at [[Westchester Hills Cemetery]] in [[Hastings-on-Hudson, New York|Hastings-on-Hudson]], New York.

From left: [[Oskar Fried]]; [[\u00c9va Gauthier]]; Ravel at piano; [[Manoah Leide-Tedesco]]; and George Gershwin.]]\nGershwin was influenced by French composers of the early twentieth century. In turn [[Maurice Ravel]] was impressed with Gershwin's abilities, commenting, \"Personally I find jazz most interesting: the rhythms, the way the melodies are handled, the melodies themselves. I have heard of George Gershwin's works and I find them intriguing.\"<ref>Mawer pp 42</ref> The [[orchestration]]s in Gershwin's symphonic works often seem similar to those of Ravel; likewise, Ravel's two piano concertos evince an influence of Gershwin.\n\nGershwin asked to study with Ravel. When Ravel heard how much Gershwin earned, Ravel replied with words to the effect of, \"You should give ''me'' lessons.\" (Some versions of this story feature [[Igor Stravinsky]] rather than Ravel as the composer; however Stravinsky confirmed that he originally heard the story from Ravel.)<ref>Arthur Rubinstein, ''My Many Years''; Merle Armitage, ''George Gershwin''; Igor Stravinsky and Robert Craft, ''Dialogues and a Diary'', all quoted in Norman Lebrecht, ''The Book of Musical Anecdotes''</ref>\n\nGershwin's own ''[[Concerto in F (Gershwin)|Concerto in F]]'' was criticized for being related to the work of [[Claude Debussy]], more so than to the expected jazz style. The comparison did not deter Gershwin from continuing to explore French styles. The title of ''[[An American in Paris]]'' reflects the very journey that he had consciously taken as a composer: \"The opening part will be developed in typical French style, in the manner of Debussy and ''[[Les Six]]'', though the tunes are original.\"<ref>(Hyland pp 126)</ref>\n\nAside from the French influence, Gershwin was intrigued by the works of [[Alban Berg]], [[Dmitri Shostakovich]], [[Igor Stravinsky]], [[Darius Milhaud]], and [[Arnold Schoenberg]]. He also asked Schoenberg for composition lessons. Schoenberg refused, saying \"I would only make you a bad Schoenberg, and you're such a good Gershwin already.\"<ref>Norman Lebrecht, ''The Book of Musical Anecdotes''</ref> (This quote is similar to one credited to [[Maurice Ravel]] during Gershwin's 1928 visit to France \u2013 \"Why be a second-rate Ravel, when you are a first-rate Gershwin?\")\n\nRussian [[Joseph Schillinger]]'s influence as Gershwin's teacher of composition (1932\u20131936) was substantial in providing him with a method of composition. There has been some disagreement about the nature of Schillinger's influence on Gershwin. After the posthumous success of ''[[Porgy and Bess]]'', Schillinger claimed he had a large and direct influence in overseeing the creation of the opera; Ira completely denied that his brother had any such assistance for this work. A third account of Gershwin's musical relationship with his teacher was written by Gershwin's close friend [[Vernon Duke]], also a Schillinger student, in an article for ''[[the Musical Quarterly]]'' in 1947.<ref>Dukelsky, Vladimir (Vernon Duke), [http://mq.oxfordjournals.org/content/XXXIII/1/102 \"Gershwin, Schillinger and Dukelsky: Some Reminiscences\"], ''[[The Musical Quarterly]]'', Volume 33, 1947, 102\u2013115 {{doi|10.1093/mq/XXXIII.1.102}}</ref>\n\nWhat set Gershwin apart was his ability to manipulate forms of music into his own unique voice. He took the jazz he discovered on [[Tin Pan Alley]] into the mainstream by splicing its rhythms and tonality with that of the popular songs of his era. Although George Gershwin would seldom make grand statements about his music, he believed that \"true music must reflect the thought and aspirations of the people and time. My people are Americans. My time is today.\"<ref name=balletmet>[http://www.balletmet.org/Notes/GeorgeG.html \"George Gershwin\"] balletmet.org, (Compiled February 2000).

Recognizing the profound and positive effect of popular music on culture, the prize is given annually to a composer or performer whose lifetime contributions exemplify the standard of excellence associated with the Gershwins. On March 1, 2007, the first Gershwin Prize was awarded to [[Paul Simon]].<ref>[http://www.pbs.org/previews/paulsimon/ \"Paul Simon: The Library Of Congress Gershwin Prize For Popular Song\"], PBS article</ref>\n\n==Recordings and film==\nEarly in his career Gershwin recorded more than one hundred and forty [[player piano]] [[piano rolls]] both under his own name and pseudonyms, which were a main source of income for him. The majority were popular music of the period and a smaller proportion were of his own works. Once his musical theatre-writing income became substantial, his regular roll-recording career became superfluous. He did record additional rolls throughout the 1920s of his main hits for the Aeolian Company's reproducing piano, including a complete version of his ''Rhapsody in Blue''.\n\nCompared to the [[piano rolls]], there are few accessible audio recordings of Gershwin's playing. His first recording was his own ''Swanee'' with the Fred Van Eps Trio in 1919. The recorded balance highlights the banjo playing of Van Eps, and the piano is overshadowed. The recording took place before ''Swanee'' became famous as an Al Jolson specialty in early 1920.\n\nGershwin did record an abridged version of ''[[Rhapsody in Blue]]'' with [[Paul Whiteman]] and his orchestra for the [[Victor Talking Machine Company]] in 1924, soon after the world premiere. Gershwin and the same orchestra made an electrical recording of the abridged version for Victor in 1927. However, a dispute in the studio over interpretation angered Paul Whiteman and he left. The conductor's baton was taken over by Victor's staff conductor [[Nathaniel Shilkret]].<ref>Peyser, p. 133</ref>\n\nGershwin made a number of solo piano recordings of tunes from his musicals, some including the vocals of Fred and Adele Astaire, as well as his ''[[Three Preludes (Gershwin)|Three Preludes]]'' for piano. In 1929, Gershwin \"supervised\" the world premiere recording of ''An American in Paris'' with Nathaniel Shilkret and the Victor Symphony Orchestra. Gershwin's role in the recording was rather limited, particularly because Shilkret was conducting and had his own ideas about the music. When it was realized that no one had been hired to play the brief [[celesta|celeste]] solo, Gershwin was asked if he could and would play the instrument, and he agreed. Gershwin can be heard, rather briefly, on the recording during the slow section.\n\nGershwin appeared on several radio programs, including [[Rudy Vallee]]'s, and played some of his compositions. This included the third movement of the ''Concerto in F'' with Vallee conducting the studio orchestra. Some of these performances were preserved on [[transcription disc]]s and have been released on LP and CD.\n\nIn 1934, in an effort to earn money to finance his planned folk opera, Gershwin hosted his own radio program titled ''Music by Gershwin''. The show was broadcast on the [[NBC Blue Network]] from February to May and again in September through the final show on December 23, 1934. He presented his own work as well as the work of other composers.<ref>Pollack, p. 163</ref> Recordings from this and other radio broadcasts include his ''Variations on I Got Rhythm'', portions of the ''Concerto in F'', and numerous songs from his musical comedies. He also recorded a run-through of his ''Second Rhapsody'', conducting the orchestra and playing the piano solos. Gershwin recorded excerpts from ''Porgy and Bess'' with members of the original cast, conducting the orchestra from the keyboard; he even announced the selections and the names of the performers. In 1935 [[RCA Victor]] asked him to supervise recordings of highlights from ''Porgy and Bess''; these were his last recordings.\n\nA 74-second newsreel film clip of Gershwin playing ''I Got Rhythm'' has survived, filmed at the opening of the Manhattan Theater (now The [[Ed Sullivan Theater]]) in August 1931.<ref>Jablonski, Edward, Stewart, Lawrence D. The Gershwin Years. Doubleday: New York, 1973. 170.</ref> There are also silent home movies of Gershwin, some of them shot on [[Kodachrome]] color film stock, which have been featured in tributes to the composer. In addition, there is newsreel footage of Gershwin playing \"Mademoiselle from New Rochelle\" and \"[[Strike Up the Band (song)|Strike Up the Band]]\" on the piano during a Broadway rehearsal of the 1930 production of ''Strike Up the Band''. In the mid-30s, \"[[Strike Up the Band (song)|Strike Up The Band]]\" was given to UCLA to be used as a football fight song, \"[[Strike Up The Band for UCLA]]\". The comedy team of [[Clark and McCullough]] are seen conversing with Gershwin, then singing as he plays.\n\nIn 1965, [[Movietone Records]] released an album MTM 1009 featuring Gershwin's piano rolls of the titled ''George Gerswhin plays RHAPSODY IN BLUE and his other favorite compositions''. The flip side of the LP featured 9 other recordings.\n\nIn 1975, [[Columbia Records]] released an album featuring Gershwin's piano rolls of the ''Rhapsody In Blue'', accompanied by the Columbia Jazz Band playing the original jazz-band accompaniment, conducted by [[Michael Tilson Thomas]]. The flip side of the [[Columbia Masterworks]] release features Tilson Thomas leading the [[New York Philharmonic]] in ''An American In Paris.''\nIn 1976, RCA Records, as part of their \"Victrola Americana\" line released a collection of Gershwin recordings, taken from 78s recorded in the 1920s and called the LP \"Gershwin plays Gershwin, Historic First Recordings\" (RCA Victrola AVM1-1740) and included recordings of \"Rhapsody in Blue\" with the Paul Whiteman Orchestra and Gershwin on piano, \"An American in Paris\", from 1927 with Gershwin on celesta; \"Three Preludes\", \"Clap Yo' Hands\" and Someone to Watch Over Me\", among others. There are a total of 10 recordings on the album.\n\nThe soundtrack to [[Woody Allen]]'s 1979 film [[Manhattan (film)|''Manhattan'']] is composed entirely of Gershwin's compositions, including \"Rhapsody in Blue\", \"[[Love is Sweeping the Country]]\", and [[But Not for Me (song)|\"But Not for Me\"]], performed by both the New York Philharmonic under [[Zubin Mehta]] and the Buffalo Philharmonic under Michael Tilson Thomas. The film begins with a monologue by Allen: \"He adored New York City ... To him, no matter what the season was, this was still a town that existed in black and white and pulsated to the great tunes of George Gershwin.\"\n\nIn 1998, two audio CDs featuring piano rolls recorded Gershwin<ref>[http://www.richard-dowling.com/GershwinRollsNotes ''George Gershwin and the player piano 1915\u20131927'']. richard-dowling.com.
