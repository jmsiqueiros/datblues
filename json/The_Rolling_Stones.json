The first  settled line-up consisted of  [[Brian Jones]] (guitar, harmonica), [[Ian Stewart (musician)|Ian Stewart]] (piano), [[Mick Jagger]] (lead vocals, harmonica), [[Keith Richards]] (guitar), [[Bill Wyman]] (bass) and [[Charlie Watts]] (drums). Jones left the band less than a month prior to his death in 1969, having already been replaced by [[Mick Taylor]], who left in 1975. Since then [[Ronnie Wood]] has been on guitar in tandem with Richards. Following Wyman's departure in 1993, [[Darryl Jones]] has been the main bassist.  Stewart was removed from the official line-up in 1963 but continued as occasional pianist until his death in 1985. Other notable keyboardists for the band have included [[Nicky Hopkins]], active from 1967 to 1982; and [[Chuck Leavell]], active since 1982. The band was first led by Jones, but after teaming as the band's songwriters, Jagger and Richards assumed ''[[De facto standard|de facto]]'' leadership.\n\nThe Rolling Stones were in the vanguard of the [[British Invasion]] of bands that became popular in the US in 1964\u201365. At first noted for their longish hair as much as their music, the band are identified with the youthful and rebellious [[counterculture of the 1960s]]. They were instrumental in making blues a major part of rock and roll, and of changing the international focus of blues culture to the less sophisticated blues typified by [[Chess Records]] artists such as [[Muddy Waters]], writer of \"[[Rollin' Stone]]\", the song after which the band is named. After a short period of musical experimentation that culminated with the poorly received and largely [[psychedelic music|psychedelic]] album ''[[Their Satanic Majesties Request]]'' (1967), the group returned to their bluesy roots with ''[[Beggars' Banquet]]'' (1968) which - along with its follow-ups, ''[[Let It Bleed]]'' (1969), ''[[Sticky Fingers]]'' (1971) and ''[[Exile on Main St.]]'' (1972) - is generally considered to be the band's best work, and are considered the Rolling Stones' \"Golden Age\".  Musicologist [[Robert Palmer (writer)|Robert Palmer]] attributed  the \"remarkable endurance\" of the Rolling Stones to being \"rooted in traditional verities, in rhythm-and-blues and soul music\" while \"more ephemeral pop fashions have come and gone\".\n\nThe band continued to make successful records through the 1970s and selling many albums with ''[[Some Girls]]'' (1978) and ''[[Tattoo You]]'' (1981) being their two most sold albums worldwide. In the 1980s, a feud between Jagger and Richards about band's musical direction almost caused the band to split but they managed to patch their relationship and had a big comeback with ''[[Steel Wheels]]'' (1989) which was followed by a big stadium and arena tour. The band's tradition of supporting albums with big stadium tours continued through the 1990s and 2000s. The band made what were then the four  [[List of highest-grossing concert tours|highest-grossing concert tours]] of all time ([[Voodoo Lounge Tour]] (1994\u201395), [[Bridges to Babylon Tour]] (1997\u201399), [[Licks Tour]] (2002\u201303) and [[A Bigger Bang Tour]] (2005-07)).<ref>http://www.timeisonourside.com/</ref>\n\nThe Rolling Stones were inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 1989, and the [[UK Music Hall of Fame]] in 2004. ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine ranked them fourth on the  \"100 Greatest Artists of All Time\" list, and their [[List of best-selling music artists|estimated album sales]] are above 250 million. They have [[The Rolling Stones discography|released]] twenty-nine studio albums, eighteen live albums and numerous compilations. ''[[Let It Bleed]]'' (1969) was their first of five consecutive number one studio and Live albums in the UK. ''[[Sticky Fingers]]'' (1971) was the first of eight consecutive number one studio albums in the US. In 2008 the band ranked 10th on the \"[[Billboard Hot 100 All-Time Top Artists#All-Time top artists|''Billboard'' Hot 100 All-Time Top Artists]]\" chart. In 2012, the band celebrated their 50th anniversary.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Early history ===\n[[Keith Richards]] and [[Mick Jagger]] were childhood friends and classmates in [[Dartford]], [[Kent]] until the Jaggers moved to [[Wilmington, Kent|Wilmington]].{{sfn|Nelson|2010|p=8}} Jagger had formed a [[garage band]] with [[Dick Taylor]], mainly playing [[Muddy Waters]], [[Chuck Berry]], [[Little Richard]], [[Howlin' Wolf]] and [[Bo Diddley]] songs.{{sfn|Nelson|2010|p=8}} Jagger first became reacquainted with Keith Richards in 1960 at [[Dartford railway station]].{{sfn|Nelson|2010|p=9}} The Chuck Berry and Muddy Waters records Jagger had in his hands revealed a mutual interest and prompted their musical partnership.{{sfn|Nelson|2010|p=9}}{{sfn|Greenfield|1981}} Richards joined Jagger and Taylor at frequent meetings at Jagger's house. The meetings switched to Taylor's house in late 1961, where the three were joined by Alan Etherington and Bob Beckwith. The five adopted the moniker the Blue Boys.{{sfn|Nelson|2010|pp=10\u201311}}\n\nIn March 1962, the Blue Boys read about the [[Ealing Jazz Club]] in newspaper ''Jazz News'' and visited the place on 7 April 1962. The band members met [[Brian Jones]] there, as he sat in playing [[slide guitar]] with [[Alexis Korner]]'s seminal London [[rhythm and blues]] band, [[Blues Incorporated]], the band that also had future Rolling Stones members [[Ian Stewart (musician)|Ian Stewart]] and [[Charlie Watts]].{{sfn|Nelson|2010|p=11}} Before visiting the Ealing Jazz Club, the Blue Boys had sent a tape of their best recordings to Alexis Korner, with which Korner was left impressed.{{sfn|Nelson|2010|p=11}} After their meeting with Korner, Jagger and Richards started jamming with Blues Incorporated.{{sfn|Nelson|2010|p=11}}\n\nBrian Jones advertised for band mates in the ''Jazz News'' and Ian Stewart found a practice space and joined with Jones and to start a rhythm and blues band playing [[Chicago blues]]. Shortly thereafter, Jagger, Taylor and Richards left Blues Incorporated to join Jones and Stewart in their effort. Also at the first rehearsal were guitarist [[Geoff Bradford (musician)|Geoff Bradford]] and vocalist Brian Knight, both of whom declined to join the band citing objections to playing the Chuck Berry and Bo Diddley songs preferred by Jagger and Richards.{{sfn|Jagger|Richards|Watts|Wood|2003|p=40}} In June 1962 the line-up was: Jagger, Jones, Richards, Stewart, Taylor, and drummer [[Tony Chapman]]. According to Richards, Jones christened the band during a phone call to ''Jazz News''. When asked for a band name Jones saw a Muddy Waters LP lying on the floor of which one of the tracks was \"[[Rollin' Stone]]\".{{sfn|Jagger|Richards|Watts|Wood|2003|p=42}}{{sfn|Nelson|2010|p=13}}\n\n===1962\u201364: building a following===\nJagger, Richards and Jones with Stewart and [[Dick Taylor]] on bass billed as \"the Rollin' Stones\" played their first gig on 12 July 1962, at the [[Marquee Club]].{{sfn|Wyman|2002|pp=36\u201337}} Their material included the Chicago blues as well as Chuck Berry and Bo Diddley songs.{{sfn|Bockris|1992|pp=42\u201343}} Bassist [[Bill Wyman]] joined in December 1962 and drummer Charlie Watts the following January 1963 to form the band's long-standing [[rhythm section]].{{sfn|Nelson|2010|pp=14\u201315}}{{sfn|Wyman|2002|pp=40\u201341; 44\u201345}} The Rolling Stones' then acting manager [[Giorgio Gomelsky]] secured a Sunday afternoon residency at the [[Crawdaddy Club]], which, Gomelsky said, triggered an \"international renaissance for the blues\" and was a seminal facet of [[Swinging London|Swinging London's]] advent.{{sfn|Jagger|Richards|Watts|Wood|2003|pp=50\u201351}}\n\nThe Rolling Stones signed manager [[Andrew Loog Oldham]], a publicist who was directed to the band by previous clients, [[the Beatles]].{{sfn|Nelson|2010|p=20}} Because Oldham had not reached majority \u2013 he was nineteen and younger than any member of the band, he could not get an agent's license, or sign any contracts without his mother also signing for her son.{{sfn|Nelson|2010|p=20}} By necessity he joined with booking agent Eric Easton.{{sfn|Wyman|1990|p=123}}{{sfn|Oldham|2000|p=223}}{{sfn|Wyman|2002|pp=56\u201357}} Gomelsky had no written agreement with the band and was not consulted.{{sfn|Wyman|1990|pp=135\u2013136}} Oldham made several changes to the band. He changed the spelling of the band name from \"the Rollin' Stones\" to \"the Rolling Stones\". He removed the \"s\" from Richards' last name saying it \"looked more pop\".{{sfn|Bockris|1992|p=63}}{{sfn|Oldham|2000|p=222}} Oldham also removed Stewart from the line-up. Wyman said Stewart did not fit Oldham's mould of \"pretty, thin, long-haired boys.\" Stewart stayed on as road manager playing piano on many studio tracks and on stage until his death in 1985.{{sfn|Oldham|2000|pp=222\u2013225}}{{sfn|Jagger|Richards|Watts|Wood|2003|p=62}}\n\n[[Decca Records]], which had passed on signing the Beatles, gave the Rolling Stones a recording contract with very favourable terms.{{sfn|Nelson|2010|p=22}} They got three times a new act's typical royalty rate, full artistic control of recordings, and ownership of the recording masters.{{sfn|Oldham|2000|pp=205, 212}}{{sfn|Jagger|Richards|Watts|Wood|2003|p=68}} The deal also let the band use non-Decca recording studios. Regent Sound Studios, a mono facility equipped with egg boxes on the ceiling for sound treatment, became the preferred facility.{{sfn|Oldham|2000|pp=209\u2013210, 212}}{{sfn|Coral|Hinckley|Rodman|1995}} Oldham, who had no recording experience but made himself the band's producer, said Regent had a sound that \"leaked, instrument-to-instrument, the right way\" creating a \"wall of noise\" that worked well for the band.{{sfn|Jagger|Richards|Watts|Wood|2003|p=68}}{{sfn|Oldham|2000|pp=252\u2013253}} Due to Regent's low rates, the band could record for extended periods rather than the usual three-hour blocks then prevalent at other studios. All tracks on the first Rolling Stones UK album were recorded at Regent.{{sfn|Nelson|2010|p=26}}{{sfn|Oldham|2000|p=213}}\n\nOldham contrasted the Rolling Stones' independence with the Beatles' obligation to record in [[EMI]]'s studios, saying it made them appear as \"mere mortals... sweating in the studio for the man\".{{sfn|Oldham|2000|p=205}} Oldham promoted the Rolling Stones as the nasty opposites of the Beatles by having the band pose unsmiling on the cover of the first UK album. He also encouraged the press to use provocative headlines such as \"Would you let your daughter marry a Rolling Stone?\"{{sfn|Marshall|2012|p=22}} Though Oldham initially had dressed the band in uniform suits, the band drifted back to wearing everyday clothes for public appearances.{{sfn|Wyman|1990|p=136}} According to Wyman: \"Our reputation and image as the Bad Boys came later, completely there, accidentally. Andrew never did engineer it. He simply exploited it exhaustively\".{{sfn|Wyman|1990|p=133}}\n<blockquote>\"we were the first pop group to break away from the whole [[Cliff Richard]] thing where the bands did little dance steps, wore identical uniforms and had snappy patter\". \u2013 Bill Wyman<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=Billboard|date=6 November 1971|page=29}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nA cover of Chuck Berry's \"[[Come On (Chuck Berry song)|Come On]]\" was the Rolling Stones' first single, released on 7 June 1963.

Their third single, [[Buddy Holly]]'s \"[[Not Fade Away (song)|Not Fade Away]]\", itself based on Bo Diddley's style, was released in February 1964 and reached No.&nbsp;3.\n\nOldham saw little future for an act that lost significant songwriting [[royalties]] by playing songs of \"middle-aged blacks,\" limiting the appeal to teenage audiences. At Oldham's urging, Jagger and Richards co-wrote songs, the first batch of which he described as \"soppy and imitative.\"{{sfn|Oldham|2000|pp=256\u2013257}} Because songwriting developed slowly, songs on the band's first album ''[[The Rolling Stones (album)|The Rolling Stones]]'', (issued in the US as ''[[England's Newest Hit Makers]]'') were primarily covers, with only one Jagger/Richards original \u2013 \"[[Tell Me (You're Coming Back)]]\" \u2013 and two numbers credited to [[Nanker Phelge]], the pen name for songs written by the entire group.{{sfn|Jagger|Richards|Watts|Wood|2003|p=84}}\n\nThe Rolling Stones' first US tour, in June 1964, was, in Bill Wyman's words, \"a disaster.\" \"When we arrived, we didn't have a hit record [there] or anything going for us.\"{{sfn|Wyman|2002|p=126}} When the band appeared on [[Dean Martin]]'s TV variety show ''The Hollywood Palace'', Martin mocked both their hair and their performance.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tv.com/shows/the-hollywood-palace/host-dean-martin-the-rolling-stones-144861/|title=The Hollywood Palace|work=[[TV.com]]|accessdate=1 June 2007}}</ref> During the tour they recorded for two days at Chess Studios in Chicago, meeting many of their most important influences, including Muddy Waters.{{sfn|Wyman|2002|pp=128\u2013129}}{{sfn|Wyman|2002|p=158}} These sessions included what would become the Rolling Stones' first number 1 hit in the UK: their cover of [[Bobby Womack|Bobby and Shirley Womack]]'s \"[[It's All Over Now]]\".{{sfn|Wyman|2002|p=137}}\n\nThe band's 8 August 1964 concert in [[Scheveningen]], Netherlands, got out of control.

To the [[Middle Eastern music|Middle Eastern]]-influenced \"[[Paint It, Black]]\" he added sitar, to the ballad \"[[Lady Jane (song)|Lady Jane]]\" he added [[Appalachian dulcimer|dulcimer]], and to \"[[Under My Thumb]]\" he added [[marimba]]s. ''Aftermath'' was also notable for the almost 12-minute long \"[[Goin' Home (The Rolling Stones song)|Goin' Home]]\", the first extended jam on a top-selling rock & roll album.\n\nThe Stones' success on the British and American singles charts peaked during 1966. \"[[19th Nervous Breakdown]]\"{{sfn|Gilliland|1969|loc=show 38, track 3}} (Feb. 1966, UK number 2, US number 2) was followed by their first trans-Atlantic number-1 hit \"[[Paint It, Black]]\" (May 1966). \"[[Mother's Little Helper]]\" (June 1966) was only released as a single in the US, where it reached number 8; it was one of the first pop songs to address the issue of prescription drug abuse.

It began with the sound of prison doors closing, and the accompanying music video included allusions to the trial of [[Oscar Wilde]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Janovitz|first=Bill|url=http://www.allmusic.com/song/we-love-you-mt0003271872|title=We Love You \u2013 song review|work=Allmusic|accessdate=14 July 2013}}</ref> On 31 July, the appeals court overturned Richards' conviction, and Jagger's sentence was reduced to a [[conditional discharge]].{{sfn|Wyman|2002|p=286}} Brian Jones' trial took place in November 1967; in December, after appealing the original prison sentence, Jones was fined \u00a31000, put on three years' probation and ordered to seek professional help.{{sfn|Wyman|2002|pp=292\u2013293; 299}}\n\nDecember 1967 also saw the release of ''[[Their Satanic Majesties Request]]'' (UK number 3; US 2), released shortly after The Beatles' ''[[Sgt.

The band parted ways with producer Andrew Oldham during the sessions. The split was amicable, at least publicly,{{sfn|Wyman|2002|p=290}} but in 2003 Jagger said: \"The reason Andrew left was because he thought that we weren't concentrating and that we were being childish. It was not a great moment really \u2013 and I would have thought it wasn't a great moment for Andrew either. There were a lot of distractions and you always need someone to focus you at that point, that was Andrew's job.\"<ref name=stonemag />\n\n''Satanic Majesties'' thus became the first album the Rolling Stones produced on their own. It was also the first of their albums released in identical versions on both sides of the Atlantic.\nIts [[psychedelia|psychedelic]] sound was complemented by the cover art, which featured a 3D photo by [[Michael Cooper (photographer)|Michael Cooper]], who had also photographed the cover of ''Sgt.

Those sessions resulted in the song \"[[Jumpin' Jack Flash]]\", released as a single in May. The song and the subsequent album, ''[[Beggars Banquet]]'' (UK number 3; US 5), an eclectic mix of country and blues-inspired tunes, marked the band's return to their roots, and the beginning of their collaboration with producer [[Jimmy Miller (producer)|Jimmy Miller]]. It featured the lead single \"[[Street Fighting Man]]\" (which addressed the political upheavals of May 1968) and the opening track \"[[Sympathy for the Devil]]\".\n\n''Beggars Banquet'' was well received at the time of release. Richards said, \"There is a change between material on ''Satanic Majesties'' and ''Beggars Banquet''. I'd grown sick to death of the whole Maharishi guru shit and the beads and bells. Who knows where these things come from, but I guess [the music] was a reaction to what we'd done in our time off and also that severe dose of reality. A spell in prison... will certainly give you room for thought... I was fucking pissed with being busted. So it was, 'Right we'll go and strip this thing down.' There's a lot of anger in the music from that period.\"{{sfn|Jagger|Richards|Watts|Wood|2003|p=114}} Richards started using [[open tuning]]s for rhythm parts (often in conjunction with a [[capo]]), most prominently an open-E or open-D tuning in 1968. Beginning in 1969, he often used 5-string open-G tuning (with the lower 6th string removed), as heard on the 1969 single \"[[Honky Tonk Women]]\", \"[[Brown Sugar (song)|Brown Sugar]]\" (''[[Sticky Fingers]]'', 1971), \"[[Tumbling Dice]]\" (capo IV), \"[[Happy (Rolling Stones song)|Happy]]\" (capo IV) (''[[Exile on Main St.]]'', 1972), and \"[[Start Me Up]]\" (''[[Tattoo You]]'', 1981).\n\nThe end of 1968 saw the filming of ''[[The Rolling Stones Rock and Roll Circus]]''. It featured [[John Lennon]], [[Yoko Ono]], [[The Dirty Mac]], [[The Who]], [[Jethro Tull (band)|Jethro Tull]], [[Marianne Faithfull]] and [[Taj Mahal (musician)|Taj Mahal]]. The footage was shelved for twenty-eight years but was finally released officially in 1996.\n\nBy the release of ''Beggars Banquet'', Brian Jones was increasingly troubled and was only sporadically contributing to the band. Jagger said that Jones was \"not psychologically suited to this way of life\".{{sfn|Jagger|Richards|Watts|Wood|2003|p=128}}  His drug use had become a hindrance, and he was unable to obtain a US [[visa (document)|visa]]. Richards reported that, in a June meeting with Jagger, Richards, and Watts at Jones' house, Jones admitted that he was unable to \"go on the road again\". Richards said all agreed to let Jones \"...say 'I've left, and if I want to I can come back'\".{{sfn|Greenfield|1981}}  On 3 July 1969, less than a month later, Jones drowned in the swimming pool under mysterious circumstances at his home, Cotchford Farm, in [[Hartfield]], [[East Sussex]].\n\n[[File:Mick Taylor2.jpg|thumb|left|Mick Taylor, 1972.]]\nThe Rolling Stones were scheduled to play at a free concert for [[Blackhill Enterprises]] in London's [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]], two days after Brian Jones' death; they decided to proceed with the show as a tribute to Jones. The concert, their first with [[Mick Taylor]], was performed in front of an estimated 250,000 fans.<ref name=stonemag /> The performance was filmed by a [[Granada Television]] production team, and was shown on British television as [[Stones in the Park]].

In 1970 the band's contracts with both [[Allen Klein]] and [[Decca Records]] ended (cf. \"[[Schoolboy Blues]]\"), and amid contractual disputes with Klein, they formed their own record company, [[Rolling Stones Records]]. ''[[Sticky Fingers]]'' (UK number 1; US 1), released in March 1971, the band's first album on their own label, featured an elaborate cover design by [[Andy Warhol]].\n\n[[File:The Rolling Stones Tongue Logo.png|thumb|150px|The Rolling Stones' logo, designed by [[John Pasche]], was introduced in 1971.]]\nThe album was the first to feature the logo of Rolling Stones Records, which effectively became the band\u2019s logo. It consisted of a pair of lips with a lapping tongue. Critic Sean Egan has said of the logo, \"Without using the Stones' name, it instantly conjures them, or at least Jagger, as well as a certain lasciviousness that is the Stones' own... It quickly and deservedly became the most famous logo in the history of popular music.\"{{sfn|Egan|2013}}\n\nThe album contains one of their best known hits, \"[[Brown Sugar (song)|Brown Sugar]]\", and the [[country music|country]]-influenced \"[[Dead Flowers (The Rolling Stones song)|Dead Flowers]]\".

Guitarists as stylistically disparate as [[Peter Frampton]] ([[Humble Pie (band)|Humble Pie]]'s lead guitarist) and [[Jeff Beck]] (ex-[[The Yardbirds|Yardbirds]] virtuoso) were auditioned as well as [[Shuggie Otis]]. Both Beck and Irish blues rock guitarist [[Rory Gallagher]] later claimed that they had played without realising they were being auditioned, and both agreed that they would never have joined. American session players [[Wayne Perkins]] and [[Harvey Mandel]] also worked on much of the album but Richards and Jagger had a preference for the band to remain purely British.

Also in 1981, they played a concert at Chicago's Checkerboard Lounge with Muddy Waters, in what would be one of his last public appearances before his death in 1983.\n\nIn mid-1982, to commemorate their 20th anniversary, the Rolling Stones took their American stage show to Europe. The [[Rolling Stones European Tour 1982|European Tour 1982]] was their first European tour in six years. The tour was similar to their 1981 American tour. For the tour, the band were joined by former [[Allman Brothers Band]] pianist, [[Chuck Leavell]], who continues to perform and record with the Rolling Stones to date.<ref name=\"Music Legends\">{{cite web |publisher=Music Legends| url= http://musiclegends.ca/interviews/chuck-leavell-interview-rolling-stones/|title=Chuck Leavell Interview| accessdate=6 May 2013|date=8 April 2010|last=Saulnier|first=Jason}}</ref> By the end of the year, the band had signed a new four-album 28 million dollar recording deal with a new label, [[Columbia Records|CBS Records]].\n\n===1983\u201388: band turmoil, solo efforts and decline===\nBefore leaving Atlantic, the Rolling Stones released ''[[Undercover (The Rolling Stones album)|Undercover]]'' (UK 3; US 4) in late 1983. Despite good reviews and the Top Ten peak position of the title track, the record sold below expectations and there was no tour to support it.

Much to the consternation of Richards, Jagger had signed a solo deal with CBS Records, and he spent much of 1984 writing songs for this first solo effort. He has also stated that he was feeling stultified within the framework of the Rolling Stones.<ref>[[25x5 \u2013 The Continuing Adventures of the Rolling Stones]]</ref> By 1985, Jagger was spending more time on solo recordings, and much of the material on 1986's ''[[Dirty Work (The Rolling Stones album)|Dirty Work]]'' (UK No.&nbsp;4; US No.&nbsp;4) was generated by Keith Richards, with more contributions by Ronnie Wood than on previous Rolling Stones albums.

The album also included \"Continental Drift\", which the Rolling Stones recorded in Tangier, Morocco in 1989 with [[The Master Musicians of Jajouka led by Bachir Attar]], coordinated by Tony King and Cherie Nutting. A BBC documentary film, ''The Rolling Stones in Morocco'', was produced by [[Nigel Finch]].\n\nThe subsequent [[Steel Wheels/Urban Jungle Tour]]s, encompassing North America, Japan and Europe, saw the Rolling Stones touring for the first time in seven years (since Europe 1982), and it was their biggest stage production to date. Opening acts included [[Living Colour]] and [[Guns N' Roses]]; the onstage personnel included a [[horn section]] and backup singers [[Lisa Fischer]] and [[Bernard Fowler]], both of whom continue to tour regularly with the Rolling Stones. Recordings from the Steel Wheels/Urban Jungle tours produced the 1991 concert album ''[[Flashpoint (album)|Flashpoint]]'' (UK 6; US 16), which also included two studio tracks recorded in 1991: the single \"[[Highwire (song)|Highwire]]\" and \"Sex Drive\". The tour also produced the IMAX concert film ''[[Stones at the Max|Live at the Max]]'' released in 1991.\n\nThese were the last Rolling Stones tours for Bill Wyman, who left the band after years of deliberation, although his retirement was not made official until January 1993.<ref name=\"tioos-chronicle93\">{{cite web |last =McPherson |first=Ian |title=The Rolling Stones Chronicle: 1993 |url= http://www.timeisonourside.com/chron1993.html |accessdate=21 March 2011}}</ref> He then published ''Stone Alone'', an autobiography based on scrapbooks and diaries he had been keeping since the band's early days. A few years later he formed [[Bill Wyman's Rhythm Kings]] and began recording and touring again.\n\nAfter the successes of the Steel Wheels/Urban Jungle tours, the band took a break. Charlie Watts released two jazz albums; Ronnie Wood recorded his fifth solo album, the first in 11 years, called ''[[Slide On This]]''; Bill Wyman released his fourth solo album, ''[[Stuff (Bill Wyman album)|Stuff]]'', released only in Japan and Argentina; Keith Richards released his second solo album in late 1992, ''[[Main Offender]]'' (UK 45; US 99), and did a small tour including big concerts in Spain and Argentina. Mick Jagger got good reviews and sales with his third solo album, ''[[Wandering Spirit (album)|Wandering Spirit]]'' (UK 12; US 11). The album sold more than two million copies worldwide, going gold in the US.<ref name=\"RIAA\"/>\n\nAfter Wyman's departure, the Rolling Stones' new distributor/record label, [[Virgin Records]], remastered and repackaged the band's back catalogue from ''Sticky Fingers'' to ''Steel Wheels'', except for the three live albums, and issued another hits compilation in 1993 entitled ''[[Jump Back: The Best of The Rolling Stones|Jump Back]]'' (UK 16; US 30). By 1993 the Rolling Stones set upon their next studio album. [[Darryl Jones]], former [[sideman]] of [[Miles Davis]] and [[Sting (musician)|Sting]], was chosen by Charlie Watts as Wyman's replacement for 1994's ''[[Voodoo Lounge]]'' (UK 1; US 2).

Sales were reasonably equivalent to those of previous records (about 1.2&nbsp;million copies sold in the US), and the subsequent [[Bridges to Babylon Tour]], which crossed Europe, North America and other destinations, proved the band to be a strong live attraction.

Throughout the band's career, their musical contributions have been marked by a continual reference and reliance on musical styles including blues, rhythm and blues, country, folk, reggae, dance, and [[world music]], exemplified by Jones' collaboration with the [[Master Musicians of Jajouka]], as well as traditional English styles that use stringed instrumentation like harps. Brian Jones experimented with the use of non-traditional instruments such as the [[sitar]] and [[slide guitar]] in their early days. The group started out covering early rock 'n' roll and blues songs, and have never stopped playing live or recording [[cover song]]s.\n\n=== Infusion of American blues ===\nJagger and Richards shared an admiration of [[Jimmy Reed]], Muddy Waters, and [[Little Walter]], and their interest influenced Brian Jones, of whom Richards says, \"He was more into [[T-Bone Walker]] and [[jazz blues]] stuff. We'd turn him onto Chuck Berry and say, 'Look, it's all the same shit, man, and you can do it.'\"{{sfn|Greenfield|1981}} Charlie Watts, a [[traditional jazz]] drummer, was also introduced to the blues through his association with the pair. \"Keith and Brian turned me on to Jimmy Reed and people like that. I learned that Earl Phillips was playing on those records like a jazz drummer, playing swing, with a straight four...\"{{sfn|Jagger|Richards|Watts|Wood|2003|p=41}}\n\nJagger, recalling when he first heard the likes of Chuck Berry, Bo Diddley, Muddy Waters, [[Fats Domino]], and other major American R&B artists, said it \"seemed the most real thing\"<ref>Davin Seay''Mick Jagger:The Story Behind the Rolling Stone''. York: Birch Lane Press, 1993.</ref> he had heard up to that point. Similarly, Keith Richards, describing the first time he listened to Muddy Waters, said it was the \"most powerful music [he had] ever heard...the most expressive.\"<ref>Robert Gordon. ''Can't Be Satisfied'' New York: Little, Brown and Company, 2002</ref> He also stated, \"when you think of some dopey, spotty seventeen year old from Dartford, who wants to be Muddy Waters-- and there were a lot of us-- in a way, very pathetic, but in another way, very... heartwarming\".<ref name=\"Richardsblues 1963\">{{cite web|url=//www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7B9tPuIP-w|title=Can Blue Men Play The Whites?|date=3 May 2009|work=Blues Britannia|publisher=BBC4|accessdate=29 May 2010}}</ref>\n\n=== Early songwriting ===\nDespite the Rolling Stones' predilection for blues and R&B numbers on their early live setlists, the first original compositions by the band reflected a more wide-ranging interest. The first Jagger/Richards single, \"[[Tell Me (You're Coming Back)]]\", has been described by critic [[Richie Unterberger]] as a \"[[pop rock]] ballad... When [Jagger and Richards] began to write songs, they were usually not derived from the blues, but were often surprisingly fey, slow, [[Beat music|Mersey]]-type pop numbers\".<ref>{{cite web|last=Unterberger|first=Richie|authorlink=Richie Unterberger|url=http://www.allmusic.com/song/tell-me-mt0011910726|title=Tell Me \u2013 song review|work=Allmusic|accessdate=14 July 2013}}</ref> \"[[As Tears Go By (song)|As Tears Go By]]\", the ballad originally written for Marianne Faithfull, was one of the first songs written by Jagger and Richards and also one of many written by the duo for other artists. Jagger said of the song, \"It's a relatively mature song considering the rest of the output at the time. And we didn't think of [recording] it, because The Rolling Stones were a butch blues group.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Wenner|first=Jann|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/news/coverstory/mick_jagger_remembers|title=Jagger Remembers|work=Rolling Stone|date=14 December 1995|accessdate=14 December 2006|archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080622012856/http://www.rollingstone.com/news/coverstory/mick_jagger_remembers|archivedate=22 June 2008}}</ref> The Rolling Stones did later record a version which became a top five hit in the US.<ref>{{cite web|last=Ruhlmann|first=William|url=http://www.allmusic.com/song/as-tears-go-by-mt0010501752|title=As Tears Go By \u2013 song review|work=Allmusic|accessdate=14 July 2013}}</ref>\n\nOn the early experience, Richards said, \"The amazing thing is that although Mick and I thought these songs were really puerile and kindergarten-time, every one that got put out made a decent showing in the charts. That gave us extraordinary confidence to carry on, because at the beginning songwriting was something we were going to do in order to say to Andrew [Loog Oldham], 'Well, at least we gave it a try...'\"{{sfn|Jagger|Richards|Watts|Wood|2003|p=85}} Jagger said, \"We were very pop-orientated. We didn't sit around listening to Muddy Waters; we listened to everything. In some ways it's easy to write to order... Keith and I got into the groove of writing those kind of tunes; they were done in ten minutes. I think we thought it was a bit of a laugh, and it turned out to be something of an apprenticeship for us.\"{{sfn|Jagger|Richards|Watts|Wood|2003|p=85}}\n\nThe writing of \"The Last Time\", the Rolling Stones' first major single, proved a turning point. Richards called it \"a bridge into thinking about writing for the Stones. It gave us a level of confidence; a pathway of how to do it.\"{{sfn|Jagger|Richards|Watts|Wood|2003|p=95}} The song was based on a traditional gospel song popularised by [[the Staple Singers]], but the Rolling Stones' number features a distinctive guitar riff, played by Brian Jones.\n\n== Band members ==\n;Current members\n* [[Mick Jagger]]&nbsp;\u2013 lead and backing vocals, harmonica, guitars
