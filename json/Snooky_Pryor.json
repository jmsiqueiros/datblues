He moved to [[Chicago]] around 1940.  \n\nWhile serving in the U.S. Army he would blow [[bugle call]]s through the powerful [[PA system]] which led him to experiment with playing the harmonica that way. Upon discharge from the Army in 1945, he obtained his own [[amplifier]] and began playing harmonica at the outdoor [[Maxwell Street]] market, becoming a regular on the [[Chicago blues]] scene.\n\nPryor recorded some of the first postwar [[Chicago blues]] records in 1948,<ref name=\"Music\"/> including \"Telephone Blues\" and \"Snooky & Moody's Boogie\" with guitarist [[Moody Jones]], and \"Stockyard Blues\" and \"Keep What You Got\" with singer/guitarist [[Floyd Jones]]. \"Snooky & Moody's Boogie\" is of considerable historical significance:  Pryor claimed that harmonica ace [[Little Walter]] directly copied the signature riff of Pryor's song into the opening eight bars of his own blues harmonica instrumental, \"Juke,\" an R&B hit in 1952.<ref>\"I Started the Big Noise Around Chicago,\" an interview with Snooky Pryor conducted by Jim O'Neal, Steve Wisner, and David Nelson, ''Living Blues'' #123 (Sept./Oct. 1995, pp. 10-11</ref> In 1967, Pryor moved south to [[Ullin, Illinois]].

Whilst on this tour they recorded an album in London, ''Homesick James & Snooky Pryor'', on Jim Simpson's label [[Big Bear Records]]. \n\nSome of his better known songs include \"Judgement Day\" (1956), and \"Crazy 'Bout My Baby\" from ''Snooky'' (1989), \"How'd You Learn to Shake It Like That\" from ''Tenth Anniversary Anthology'' (1989) and \"Shake My Hand\" (1999).\n\nPryor's son Richard \"Rip Lee\" Pryor is also a blues musician, and performs in and around his residential city of [[Carbondale, Illinois]].\n\n==Discography==\n{{Expand list|date=August 2008}}\n\n===Singles===\n*\"Boogie\" ([[A-side and B-side|A-side]]) \"Telephone Blues\" ([[A-side and B-side|B-side]]) (1948) Planet\n*\"Someone to Love Me\" (a)  \"Judgement Day\" (b) (1956) [[Vee Jay Records]]\n\n===Albums===\n*''Snooky Pryor'' (1970) Flyright Record, FLY 100, Made in England\n*''Homesick James & Snooky Pryor'' (1973) [[Virgin Records]], London\n*\"Do It If You Want To\" (1973) [[ABC Records]], Los Angeles, New York\n*''Snooky'' (1989) [[Blind Pig Records]]\n*''Snooky Pryor'' (1991) Paula Records\n*''Johnny Shines and Snooky Pryor: Back To The Country'' (1991) Blind Pig Records\n*''Snooky Pryor: Too Cool To Move'' (1992) Antones\n*''In This Mess Up to My Chest'' (1994) Antones\n*''Mind Your Own Business'' (1996) Antones\n*''Snooky Pryor: Shake My Hand'' (1999) Blind Pig Records\n*''[[Double Shot!
