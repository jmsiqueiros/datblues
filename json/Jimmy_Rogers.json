Lane in  [[Ruleville, Mississippi]] on June 3, 1924 and was raised in [[Atlanta, Georgia|Atlanta]] and [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]].<ref>Harris, S. (1979): Blues Who's Who, New York, Da Capo Press, p. 442</ref> He adapted the professional surname 'Rogers' from his stepfather's last name.<ref name=\"russell\"/>  Rogers learned the harmonica alongside his childhood friend [[Snooky Pryor]], and as a teenager took up the guitar and played professionally in [[East St. Louis, Illinois]], where he played with [[Robert Lockwood, Jr.]] among others, before moving to [[Chicago]] in the mid-1940s.{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}} By 1946 he had recorded as a harmonica player and singer for the Harlem record label run by [[J. Mayo Williams]]. Rogers' name did not appear on the record, which was mislabeled as the work of \"[[Memphis Slim]] and his Houserockers.\"\n\nIn 1947, Rogers, [[Muddy Waters]] and [[Little Walter]] began playing together as Muddy Waters' first band in Chicago (sometimes referred to as \"The Headcutters\" or \"The Headhunters\" due to their practice of stealing jobs from other local bands), while the band members each recorded and released music credited to each of them as solo artists.  The first [[Muddy Waters]] band defined the sound of the nascent \"[[Chicago Blues]]\" style (more specifically \"South Side\" Chicago Blues). Rogers made several more sides of his own with small labels in Chicago, but none were released at the time.  He began to enjoy success as a solo artist with [[Chess Records]] in 1950, scoring a hit with \"[[That's All Right (Jimmy Rogers song)|That's All Right]]\", but he stayed with Muddy Waters until 1954.<ref name=\"russell\"/>  In the mid-1950s he had several successful releases on the Chess label, most featuring either [[Little Walter]] Jacobs or [[Big Walter Horton]] on harmonica, most notably \"Walking By Myself\",<ref>{{cite web |url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p350/biography|pure_url=yes}}|title=Good Rockin' Charles|author=Bill Dahl |publisher=[[Allmusic]] |accessdate=November 23, 2011}}</ref> but as the 1950s drew to a close and interest in the blues waned, he gradually withdrew from the music industry.<ref name=\"russell\"/>\n\nIn the early 1960s Rogers briefly worked as a member of [[Howling Wolf]]'s band, before quitting the music business altogether for almost a decade. He worked as a taxicab driver and owned a clothing store that burned down in the [[1968 Chicago riots]] that followed the assassination of [[Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.]]  He gradually began performing in public again, and in 1971 when fashions made him a reasonable draw in Europe, Rogers began occasionally touring and recording, including a 1977 reunion session with his old bandleader Muddy Waters. By 1982, Rogers was again a full-time solo artist.\n\nIn 1995 Rogers was inducted into the [[Blues Hall of Fame]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blues.org/halloffame/inductees.php4?YearId=10|title=Blues Foundation :: Inductees|publisher=www.blues.org|accessdate=October 27, 2008}}</ref>\n\nHe continued touring and recording albums until his death from [[Colorectal cancer|colon cancer]] in [[Chicago]] in 1997.<ref name=\"Dead\">[http://thedeadrockstarsclub.com/1996.html Thedeadrockstarsclub.com - accessed November 2009]</ref> He was survived by his son, [[Jimmy D.
