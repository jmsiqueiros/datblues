As the profile goes on to say that, due to \"indifference to learning\", \"he abandoned school permanently\" in 1931, it is more likely he would have done this at age 16 than age 18. The 1915 birthdate seems more likely and is supported by all other sources quoted.</ref> &ndash; June 14, 1969), born in [[Omaha, Nebraska|Omaha]], [[Nebraska]], was an [[United States|American]] [[blues shouter]] and [[rhythm and blues]] [[singing|singer]] of upbeat songs,  featuring humorous, often [[ribald]] [[lyrics]]. With fifteen [[Top 40|Top 10]] [[hit record|hits]] between 1946 and 1952, Harris is generally considered one of [[rock and roll]]'s forerunners, influencing [[Elvis Presley]] among others.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}  He was the subject of a 1994 [[biography]] by Tony Collins.<ref>Tony Collins, ''Rock Mr. Blues: The Life & Music of Wynonie Harris'', (Big Nickel Publications, 1995).</ref>\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life and family===\nHarris' mother, Mallie Hood Anderson, was fifteen and unmarried at the time of his birth. Harris' paternity is uncertain.  Harris' wife, Olive E. Goodlow, and daughter Patricia Vest, have said that Harris' father was a [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]], named Blue Jay. Harris had no father figure in the house until 1920, when his mother married Luther Harris, fifteen years her senior.   \n\nIn 1931 at age 16, Harris dropped out of [[high school]] in [[North Omaha]].  The following year his first child, daughter Micky, was born to Naomi Henderson.  Ten months later, Harris' second child, son Wesley, was born to Laura Devereaux.  Both children were raised by their mothers.  Wesley became a singer in the Five Echoes and [[The Sultans]].  Later he became a singer and guitarist in [[Preston Love]]'s [[musical ensemble|band]]. Eventually, Wesley's grandson (Wynonie's Great Grandson), Jourdan Devereaux, under the pseudonym \"L Oquence\" began a music career in the genre of Hip-Hop. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://loquence.webs.com/about-me |title=L Oquence - About Me |publisher=Loquence.webs.com |date= |accessdate=2014-05-21}}</ref>\n\nIn 1935 Harris, age 20, started dating 16-year-old Olive E. Goodlow (Ollie) of neighboring [[Council Bluffs, Iowa|Council Bluffs]], [[Iowa]], who came to Omaha to watch him perform.  On May 20, 1936, Ollie gave birth to daughter Pattie (Adrianne Patricia).  On December 11, 1936, they married.  Later they lived in the Logan Fontenelle projects in [[North Omaha]]. Ollie worked as a barmaid and nurse; Wynonie sang in clubs as well as taking on some odd jobs.  Wynonie's mother, Mallie Harris, was Pattie's main caretaker.  In 1940, Wynonie and Ollie Harris moved to [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], [[California]], leaving Pattie with Mallie in Omaha.\n\n===Early career===\nWith [[dancing|dance]] partner Velda Shannon, Harris formed a dance team in the early 1930s.<ref name=\"russell\">{{cite book\n| first= Tony\n| last= Russell\n| year= 1997\n| title= The Blues - From [[Robert Johnson (musician)|Robert Johnson]] to [[Robert Cray]]\n| edition= \n| publisher=Carlton Books Limited \n| location= Dubai\n| page= 117\n| isbn= 1-85868-255-X}}</ref>  The team performed around North Omaha's flourishing entertainment community, and by 1934 they were a regular attraction at the Ritz Theatre.  It was not until 1935, however, that Harris was able to earn his living as an entertainer.  While performing at Jim Bell's new [[Harlem]] [[nightclub]] with Velda Shannon, Harris began to sing the [[blues]]. \n\nHe also began traveling frequently to [[Kansas City, Kansas|Kansas City]], [[Kansas]] where he paid close attention to the [[blues shouter]]s including [[Jimmy Rushing]] and [[Big Joe Turner]].  Harris became a local celebrity in Omaha during the depths of the [[Great Depression]] in 1935. Harris' break in Los Angeles was at a nightclub owned by [[Curtis Mosby]]. It was here that Harris became known as \"Mr. Blues\".\n\n===With Lucky Millinder===\nDue to the [[1942-44 musicians' strike]], Harris was unable to pursue a recording career.  Instead, he relied on personal appearances.  Performing almost continuously, in late 1943 he appeared at the [[Rhumboogie Caf\u00e9|Rhumboogie Club]] in [[Chicago]].  Harris was spotted by [[Lucky Millinder]] who asked him to join his band's [[concert tour|tour]].  Harris joined on March 24, 1944, while the band was in the middle of a week-long residency at the Regal in Chicago.  They moved on to [[New York City|New York]], where on April 7 Harris took the stage with Millinder's band for his debut at the [[Apollo Theatre]] in [[Harlem]]. It was during this performance that Harris first publicly performed \"Who Threw the Whiskey in the Well\" (a song recorded two years earlier by [[Doc Wheeler]]'s Sunset Orchestra).\n\nAfter the band's stint at the Apollo, they moved on to their regular residency at the Savoy Ballroom, also in Harlem. Here, [[Preston Love]], Harris' childhood friend, joined Millinder's band replacing [[alto saxophone|alto saxophonist]] [[Tab Smith]]. On May 26, 1944, Harris made his [[sound recording and reproduction|recording]] debut with Lucky Millinder and His Orchestra. Entering a [[recording studio]] for the first time, Harris sang on two of the five cuts that day, \"Hurry, Hurry\" and \"Who Threw the Whiskey in the Well\", for the [[Decca Records|Decca]] [[record label|label]]. Although lessening, the shellac embargo had not yet been removed, and release of the record was delayed.\n\nHarris' success and popularity grew as Millinder's band toured the country.  He and Millinder had a falling out over money. In September 1945 while playing in [[San Antonio, Texas|San Antonio]], [[Texas]], Harris quit Millinder's band.  Three weeks later, upon hearing of Harris' separation from the band, a [[Houston, Texas]] promoter refused to allow Millinder's band to perform.  Millinder called Harris and agreed to pay Harris' asking price of one-hundred dollars a night.  The promoter re-instated the date, but it was the final time Harris and Millinder worked together.  [[Bull Moose Jackson]] replaced Harris as the vocalist in the band.\n\nIn April 1945, a year after the song was recorded, Decca released \"Who Threw the Whiskey in the Well\".<ref name=\"russell\"/>  It became the group's biggest [[hit record|hit]]; it went to [[record chart|number one]] on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs|R&B]] [[record chart|chart]] on July 14 and stayed there for eight weeks.<ref>[[R&B number-one hits of 1945 (USA)]]\n</ref><ref>[[List of number-one rhythm and blues hits (United States)]]</ref>  The song remained on the charts for almost five months, also becoming popular with [[white people|white]] audiences.<ref>\"Who Threw the Whiskey in the Well\" also reached #7 on the [[United States|U.S.]] [[Billboard Hot 100|pop chart]],</ref> an unusual feat for black musicians of that era. In California the success of the song opened doors for Harris.  Since the contract with Decca was with Millinder (meaning Harris was a free agent), Harris could choose from the [[recording contract]]s with which he was presented.\n\n===Solo career===\nIn July 1945, Harris signed with [[Philo Records (rhythm & blues)|Philo]], a label owned by the [[sibling|brothers]] Leo and Edward Mesner.  Harris' band was assembled by [[Johnny Otis]], and the group recorded the [[gramophone record|78rpm record]] \"Around the Clock\". Although not a chart-topper, the song became popular and was [[cover version|covered]] by many [[musician|artists]], including [[Willie Bryant]], Jimmy Rushing and Big Joe Turner. \n\nHarris went on to record sessions for other labels, including [[Apollo Records (1944)|Apollo]], [[Bullet Records|Bullet]] and [[Aladdin Records|Aladdin]]. His greatest success came when he signed for [[Syd Nathan]]'s [[King Records (USA)|King]] label, where he enjoyed a series of hits on the U.S. R&B chart in the late 1940s and early 1950s.  These included a 1948 cover of [[Roy Brown (blues musician)|Roy Brown]]'s \"[[Good Rocking Tonight]]\",<ref>Harris re-recorded Brown's hit in 1948, after Brown wrote and recorded it in 1947.  It was later rerecorded by [[Elvis Presley]] in 1954, with later versions by [[Jerry Lee Lewis]], [[Ricky Nelson]], [[Buddy Holly]], [[Pat Boone]] and [[Paul McCartney]]</ref> \"Good Morning Judge\" and \"[[All She Wants to Do Is Rock]]\". In 1946, Harris recorded two singles with pianist Herman \"Sonny\" Blount, who later earned fame as the eclectic jazz composer and bandleader [[Sun Ra]]. \n\nIn 1950, he released the double-sided hit, \"Sittin' On It All the Time\" b/w \"Baby, Shame On You\" (King 4330) and in 1951, he covered [[Hank Penny]]'s \"Bloodshot Eyes\" (King 4461).<ref>The Blue Moon Boys - The Story of Elvis Presley's Band.

In 1960 he cut six sides for Roulette Records that included a remake of his hit \"Bloodshot Eyes\" as well as \"Sweet Lucy Brown\", \"Spread the News\", \"Saturday Night\", \"Josephine\" and \"Did You Get the Message\".<ref>CD: Various Artists: Roulette Rock & Roll, Vol. 2: Everybody's Gonna (1994) Castle/Sequel</ref>  He also became more indebted, and was forced to live in less glamorous surroundings.<ref name=\"russell\"/> \n\nIn 1964 Harris resettled for the last time in Los Angeles.  His final recordings were three sides which he did for the [[Chess Records]] label (in Chicago) in 1964: \"The Comeback\", \"Buzzard Luck\" and \"Conjured\".<ref>CD: Various Artists: Shoutin', Swingin' & Makin' Love(1991) MCA</ref> His final large-scale performance was at the Apollo, New York in November 1967, where he performed with Big Joe Turner, [[Big Mama Thornton]], [[Jimmy Witherspoon]] and [[T-Bone Walker]].\n\n===Death===\nOn June 14, 1969, aged 53, Harris died of [[esophageal cancer]] at the USC Medical Center Hospital in Los Angeles.<ref name=\"russell\"/>\n\n==Legacy==\nSince the end of the twentieth century, there has been a resurgence of interest in his music. Some of his recordings are being reissued and he has been honored posthumously:\n*1994 Inducted into the W.C. Handy [[Blues Hall of Fame]] by the [[Blues Foundation]] in [[Memphis, Tennessee]].\n*1998 Inducted into the Nebraska Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in [[Lincoln, Nebraska|Lincoln]].\n*2000 Inducted into the High School Hall of Fame at [[Omaha Central High School|Central High School]] in Omaha, Nebraska.\n*2005 Inducted into the [[Omaha Black Music Hall of Fame]]<ref>Harris was amongst the 40 inaugural inductees to the [[Omaha Black Music Hall of Fame]] in 2005</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* [[Omaha World-Herald]], September 10, 1972, p.
