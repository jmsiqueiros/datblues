After seeing James Cotton perform when she was 15, she made the lifelong decision to play blues guitar. At 16, Foley started playing professionally around Ottawa with local blues bands. By 21, she was living in Austin, Texas, and recording for legendary blues label Antone\u2019s Records. Her first CD ''Young Girl Blues'' quickly established her unique talents as a blues guitarist and songwriter. Throughout the 90\u2019s she took to the road with her paisley Telecaster and honed her craft working/sharing the stage with such artists as BB King, Buddy Guy, Lucinda Williams and Tom Petty. In 1997 she moved back to Canada to raise her son. In 2000, her home country honored her with her first Juno Award (Canada's premier music awards): Best Blues Album for her CD ''Love Comin\u2019 Down''. Since 1999, she has received a record-setting 17 Maple Blues Awards, and 3 Troph\u00e9es de blues in France. Sue also received a nomination for the prestigious W.C. Handy Award for best contemporary female artist in 2002.\n\n==Discography==\n\n===Foley albums===\n*1992 - ''Young Girl Blues''\n*1993 - ''Without a Warning''\n*1995 - ''Big City Blues''\n*1996 - ''Walk in the Sun''\n*1998 - ''Ten Days in November''\n*2000 - ''Back to the Blues''\n*2000 - ''Love Comin' Down''\n*2002 - ''Where the Action Is''\n*2004 - ''Change''\n*2006 - ''New Used Car''\n*2007 - ''Time Bomb''\n*2010 - ''He Said She Said'' (with Peter Karp)\n*2012 - \"Beyond The Crossroads\" (with Peter Karp)\n\n===Contributions to other albums===\n*2002 ''The Blues: From Yesterday's Masters to Today's Cutting Edge'' ([[Shanachie Records|Shanachie]], American Roots Songbook, as licensed to [[St. Clair Entertainment Group|St. Clair Entertainment]])<ref>\"Every Road I Take\"</ref>\n*2006 ''[[Saturday Night Blues: 20 Years]]'' ([[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]]/[[Universal Music Group]])<ref>Being live recordings from the CBC radio program [[Saturday Night Blues]], hosted by [[Holger Petersen]].
