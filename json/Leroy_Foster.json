He was a significant figure in the development of the post-war electric [[Chicago blues]] sound, most notably as a member of the [[Muddy Waters]] band during its formative years.<ref name=\"Allmusic-bio\">{{cite web|author=Bill Dahl |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/leroy-foster-mn0000205592/biography |title=Leroy Foster &#124; Biography |publisher=AllMusic |date= |accessdate=2014-06-14}}</ref>\n\n==Life and career==\nFoster was born in [[Algoma, Mississippi|Algoma]], [[Mississippi]], [[United States]].  He moved to Chicago in the mid-1940s, and by 1946 was working with [[piano|pianist]] [[Sunnyland Slim]] and [[harmonica]] player [[Sonny Boy Williamson I|John Lee \"Sonny Boy\" Williamson]].<ref name=\"Parkway\">{{cite web|url=http://hubcap.clemson.edu/~campber/parkway.html|title=The Legendary Parkway Label|publisher=Hubcap.clemson.edu|accessdate=July 30, 2009}}</ref>  He was introduced to singer and guitarist [[Muddy Waters]] by an acquaintance Waters met at a recording session in 1946, and was soon playing guitar and drums in Waters\u2019 band, along with guitar and harmonica player [[Jimmy Rogers]],<ref>Gordon pp. 82-83</ref> with the band later joined by [[Little Walter]] on harmonica. Calling themselves the Headhunters, the trio were known for going from club to club and \u201ccutting\u201d (i.e. engaging in musical duels with) other bands.<ref name=\"Allmusic-bio\"/>\n\nFoster\u2019s first recordings were made with pianist Lee Brown in 1945 for [[J. Mayo Williams]]' Chicago label.  In 1946, he appeared on another session with Lee Brown and recorded with James \"Beale Street\" Clark for Columbia.  He also accompanied [[Sunnyland Slim]] on a 1947 or 1948 session for the Opera label.<ref name=\"Parkway\"/>  Further recordings followed, both under his own name and backing Sunnyland Slim, Muddy Waters, Little Walter and pianist [[Little Johnny Jones (pianist)|Johnny Jones]], before his most notable session, for the Parkway label in 1950. \n\nThis session featured the personnel of Muddy Waters' band of the time: Foster, Waters, Little Walter and (on two tracks only, since he was late for the session), Jimmy Rogers.<ref>Gordon, p. 99</ref>  Four singles were released from the session, two by Foster and two by Little Walter.  One of the singles, the two-part \"[[Rollin' and Tumblin']]\" was notable enough to be reviewed, unusually for a down home blues release, in the ''[[Chicago Defender]]'' by Edward Myers, who described it as having \"the sound and beat of African chant\".<ref name=\"Parkway\"/> The track featured only Foster\u2019s drumming and singing, Walter\u2019s harmonica and Waters\u2019 slide guitar, with hummed ensemble vocals on one side.  Unfortunately, Waters\u2019 guitar playing and backup singing were distinctive enough for it to come to the attention of [[Leonard Chess]] of [[Chess Records]], who had Waters under an exclusive recording contract.  As a result, Waters was made to record his own version of the song for the larger Chess label in order to \"kill\" the Parkway recording.<ref>Rowe, p. 75</ref>\n\nAfter the Parkway session, Foster left Waters\u2019 band, possibly in the hope of a solo career resulting from the releases on Parkway, but unfortunately the label soon folded. Afterwards, Foster recorded a further three sessions under his own name for the [[JOB Records|JOB]] label between 1950 and 1953, but died from a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]], possibly as a result of [[alcoholism]], at the age of 35 in 1958.<ref name=\"Parkway\"/><ref>{{cite web|author=Doc Rock |url=http://thedeadrockstarsclub.com/1950.html |title=The 50s and earlier |publisher=The Dead Rock Stars Club |date= |accessdate=2014-06-14}}</ref>\n\nFoster was buried at Fern Oak Cemetery in [[Griffith, Indiana]].<ref>Harris, S.
