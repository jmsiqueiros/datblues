Reed was a major player in the field of [[electric blues]], as opposed to the more acoustic-based sound of many of his contemporaries.<ref name=\"russell\"/> His music had a significant impact on many [[rock and roll]] artists who followed, such as [[Elvis Presley]], [[Billy Gibbons]], and [[The Rolling Stones]].\n\n==Biography==\nReed was born in [[Dunleith, Mississippi]], in 1925, learning the harmonica and guitar from [[Eddie Taylor]], a close friend.<ref name=pc4/> After spending several years busking and performing in the area, Reed moved to [[Chicago, Illinois]], in 1943 before being drafted into the US Navy during World War II. In 1945, Reed was discharged and moved back to Mississippi for a brief period, marrying his girlfriend, Mary \"Mama\" Reed, before moving to [[Gary, Indiana]] to work at an [[Armour & Co.]] meat packing plant.  Mama Reed appears as an [[uncredited background singer]] on many of his songs, notably the major hits \"[[Baby What You Want Me to Do]]\",  \"[[Big Boss Man (song)|Big Boss Man]]\" and \"[[Bright Lights, Big City (1961 song)|Bright Lights, Big City]]\".<ref name=pc4>{{Pop Chronicles|4|3}}</ref> \n\nBy the 1950s, Reed had established himself as a popular musician and joined the \"Gary Kings\" with [[John Brim]], as well as playing on the street with Willie Joe Duncan. Reed failed to gain a recording contract with [[Chess Records]], but signed with [[Vee-Jay Records]] through Brim's drummer, [[Albert King]]. At Vee-Jay, Reed began playing again with Eddie Taylor and soon released \"You Don't Have to Go\", his first hit record. This was followed by a long string of hits. \n\nReed maintained his reputation despite his rampant alcoholism; sometimes his wife had to help him remember the lyrics to his songs while recording. In 1957, Reed developed [[epilepsy]], though the condition was not correctly diagnosed for a long time, as Reed and doctors assumed it was [[delirium tremens]].<ref>{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p504/biography|pure_url=yes}}|title=Jimmy Reed Biography|author=Cub Koda, AllMusic.com}}</ref>\n\nIn spite of his numerous hits, Reed's personal problems prevented him from achieving the same level of fame as other popular blues artists of the time, though he had more hit songs than many others. When Vee-Jay Records closed down, Reed's manager signed a contract with the fledgling [[ABC-Paramount Records|ABC-Bluesway]] label, but Reed was never able to score another hit.\n\nIn 1968 he toured Europe with the [[American Folk Blues Festival]].<ref name=\"russell\">{{cite book\n| first= Tony\n| last= Russell\n| year= 1997\n| title= The Blues: From Robert Johnson to Robert Cray\n| publisher= Carlton Books Limited \n| location= Dubai\n| pages= 76\u201377\n| isbn= 1-85868-255-X}}</ref>\n\nJimmy Reed died in [[Oakland, California]] in 1976,<ref name=\"IMDb\"/> of [[respiratory failure]],<ref name=\"Dead\">[http://thedeadrockstarsclub.com/1970.html?referer=www.clickfind.com.au Thedeadrockstarsclub.com] - accessed July 2010</ref> eight days short of his 51st birthday. He is interred in the Lincoln Cemetery in [[Worth, Illinois]].\n\nIn 1991 Reed was posthumously inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]].\n\n==Influence==\n{{Unsourced|section|date=November 2011}}\n[[The Rolling Stones]] have cited Reed as a major influence on their sound, and their early set lists included many of Reed's songs, including tracks like \"[[Ain't That Lovin' You Baby (Jimmy Reed song)|Ain't That Lovin' You Baby]]\", \"The Sun is Shining\" (also played at the Stones' 1969 [[Altamont Free Concert|Altamont concert]]), \"Bright Lights, Big City\" and \"Shame, Shame, Shame\" ; the [[A-side and B-side|B-side]] of their February 1964 hit single \"[[Not Fade Away (song)|Not Fade Away]]\" was a pastiche of \"Shame, Shame, Shame\" entitled \"[[Little by Little (The Rolling Stones song)|Little by Little]]\". Their [[The Rolling Stones (album)|first album]], '''''The Rolling Stones''''', (subtitled '''''England's Newest Hit Makers''''' in America), released in April 1964, featured both \"[[Little by Little (The Rolling Stones song)|Little by Little]]\" and their [[cover version|cover]] of Reed's \"Honest I Do\". \n\n[[The Yardbirds]] recorded an instrumental dedicated to him entitled \"Like Jimmy Reed Again\", which was released on the \"definitive edition\" of their album ''[[Having a Rave Up]]''.\n\n[[Van Morrison]]'s group [[Them (band)|Them]] covered \"Bright Lights, Big City\" and \"Baby, What You Want Me To Do\", both of which can be found on ''[[The Story of Them Featuring Van Morrison]]''.\n \n\"Big Boss Man\" was sung regularly by [[Ron \"Pigpen\" McKernan]] with the [[Grateful Dead]] during the 1960s and early 1970s and appears on their live album ''Skull and Roses''. It was revived a few times by [[Jerry Garcia]] with the  Dead during the 1980s. Bob Weir of the Dead also played it a few times with [[Kingfish (band)|Kingfish]] in the mid 70s, and more recently with [[Ratdog]]. [[Phil Lesh]] also plays it with Phil & Friends.  The Grateful Dead have also performed Baby What You Want Me to Do with [[Brent Mydland]] on vocals. \n\n[[Elvis Presley]] recorded several of Reed's songs, scoring a 1967 hit with \"Big Boss Man\" and recording several performances of \"Baby, What You Want Me to Do\" for his [[Elvis Presley's '68 Comeback Special|1968 Comeback TV Special]]. (However, Presley's 1964 hit, \"Ain't That Lovin' You Baby\" is a different song than that recorded by Reed.)  The song \"Baby, What You Want Me to Do\" was also covered by [[Wishbone Ash]] on their 1972 [[live album]], ''[[Live Dates]]''. \"Baby What You Want Me to Do\" was also frequently performed by [[Etta James]] and [[Hot Tuna]]. Johnny and Edgar Winter performed the song live in 1975 and included it on Johnny and Edgar Winter Together.\n\nReed's recordings of \"[[Big Boss Man (song)|Big Boss Man]]\" and \"Bright Lights, Big City\" were both voted onto the list of [[The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll]].\n\nNoted [[Austin, Texas]] musicians, [[Omar Kent Dykes]] and [[Jimmie Vaughan]] released an album entitled ''On the Jimmy Reed Highway'' as a tribute to Reed.<ref>{{cite web|last=Gilstrap |first=Andrew |url=http://www.popmatters.com/pm/music/reviews/50066/omar-kent-dykes-and-jimmie-vaughan-on-the-jimmy-reed-highway/ |title=Popmatters website album review - accessed December 2007 |publisher=Popmatters.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-13}}</ref>\n\n[[Bill Cosby]] covered 4 of Reed's songs \u2013 \"Bright Lights, Big City\", \"Big Boss Man\", \"Hush Hush\" and \"Aw Shucks, Hush Your Mouth\" \u2013 on his 1967 album ''[[Silver Throat: Bill Cosby Sings]]''.\n\n[[Steve Miller Band]] covered 5 of Reed's songs \u2013 \"You're So Fine\" on his 1968 album ''[[Sailor]]''; \"I Wanna Be Loved (But By Only You)\", \"Big Boss Man\", \"Caress Me Baby\" and \"Ain't That Lovin' You Baby\" on his 1986 album ''[[Living in the 20th Century]]''.\n\n[[Neil Young]] historically plays Reed's music to his audience before his shows.\n\nBritish punk pioneer [[Billy Childish]] and his band [[Thee Headcoats]] released an EP of Reed covers entitled ''The Jimmy Reed Experience'' on [[Get Hip Records]] in 1997.\n\n==Discography==\n===Charting singles===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
