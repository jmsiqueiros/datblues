Altenburgh was writing and recording in the style of the New Wave Rock sound that was just gaining popularity at that time.  After sending Geffen a demo of recent songs he had recorded, the A&R Director at Geffen asked Altenburgh for more music.  As Altenburgh stated,  \"I took the next six months writing new material.  What I didn\u2019t realize, at that time,  is they wanted more music immediately, not in six months.  When I contacted them with my new recordings, they said I was too late, that that type of music was already predominate in the pop/rock industry.  So they didn\u2019t sign me.\"  Altenburgh, discouraged over missed opportunity,  left the rock world completely.<ref name=\"blues1\">{{cite web|last=Limnios |first=Michalis |url=http://blues.gr/profiles/blogs/interview-johnny-altenburgh-piano-sun-fame-jazz-blues |title=Pianist / agent Johnny Altenburgh talks about Sun & Fame studios, Jazz & Blues, and Wisconsin scene |publisher=Blues.Gr |date=2013-06-19 |accessdate=2014-04-07}}</ref>\n\nIn 1981 Altenburgh enrolled at the [[University of Wisconsin-Oshkosh]] and studied music/recording technology.
