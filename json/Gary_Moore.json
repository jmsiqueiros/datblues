Moore shared the stage with such blues and rock musicians as [[B.B. King]], [[Albert King]], [[George Harrison]], and [[Greg Lake]], as well as having a successful solo career. He guested on a number of albums recorded by high-profile musicians.\n\n==Early life and career==\n\nMoore grew up on Castleview Road opposite [[Stormont Parliament Buildings]], off the Upper Newtownards Road in east [[Belfast]], as one of five children of a promoter named Bobby and housewife, Winnie, but he left the city as a teenager, because of troubles in his family - his parents parted a year later - just as [[The Troubles]] were starting in Northern Ireland.<ref name=interview>[http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/entertainment/music/news/moores-almanac-13444722.html \"Moore's almanac.\"] ''Belfast Telegraph'', 24 May 2007. Retrieved 7 February 2011.</ref>\n\nMoore started performing at a young age, having picked up a battered [[Steel-string guitar|acoustic guitar]] at the age of eight. He got his first quality guitar at the age of 14, learning to play the right-handed instrument in the standard way despite being left-handed.\n\nAiming to become a musician, he moved to Dublin at the age of 16. Moore's greatest influence in the early days was guitarist [[Peter Green (musician)|Peter Green]] of [[Fleetwood Mac]] who was a mentor to Moore when performing in [[Dublin]]. Green's continued influence on Moore was later repaid as a tribute to Green on his 1995 album ''[[Blues for Greeny]]'', an album consisting entirely of Green compositions. On this tribute album, Moore played Green's 1959 [[Les Paul]] Standard guitar which Green had lent to Moore after leaving Fleetwood Mac. Moore ultimately purchased the guitar, at Green's request, so that \"it would have a good home\".<ref>[http://www.maverick-music.com/Scripts/pgreen-1.htm \"Green Lantern! \u2013 The Peter Green Les Paul] Guitarist Magazine, April 1995 (viewed 12 April 2010)</ref> Other early musical influences were artists such as [[Albert King]], [[Elvis Presley]], [[The Shadows]] and [[The Beatles]]. Later, having seen [[Jimi Hendrix]] and [[John Mayall's Bluesbreakers]] in his home town of Belfast, his own style was developing into a blues-rock sound that would be the dominant form of his career in music.\n\n==Changing bands==\n\nIn Dublin, Moore joined the group [[Skid Row (Irish band)|Skid Row]] with Noel Bridgeman and [[Brush Shiels|Brendan \"Brush\" Shiels]]. It was with this group that he earned a reputation in the [[music industry]], and his association with [[Phil Lynott]] began.<ref name=\"BBCdeath\"/>\n\nIn 1970, Moore moved to England and remained there, apart from two short periods in the United States. In 1973, under the moniker \"The Gary Moore Band\" he released his first solo album in 1973, ''[[Grinding Stone (album)|Grinding Stone]]'' . \"Grinding Stone\" was issued in North America on Neil Kempfer-Stocker's fledgling record label imprint Cosmos and received \"Album of the Year\" accolades on KTAC-FM/Seattle-Tacoma, Washington in 1974.\n\nIn 1974 he re-joined Lynott, when he first joined [[Thin Lizzy]] after the departure of founding member [[Eric Bell]].\n\nFrom 1975 to August 1978, he was a member of [[Colosseum II]]. With the band he also collaborated with [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]] on the composer's ''[[Variations (Andrew Lloyd Webber album)|Variations]]'' album in 1978.\n\nIn 1977, Moore re-joined Thin Lizzy, first as a temporary replacement for [[Brian Robertson]], and on a permanent basis a year later.\n\n==Solo career==\n\nIn July 1979, he left the band permanently to focus on his solo career, again with help from Phil Lynott. The combination of Moore's blues-based guitar and Lynott's voice produced \"[[Parisienne Walkways (song)|Parisienne Walkways]]\", which reached the [[Top 40|Top Ten]] in the [[UK Singles Chart]] in April 1979 and the [[Thin Lizzy]]  album ''[[Black Rose: A Rock Legend]]'' which reached number two in the UK album chart. Moore appears in the videos for \"[[Waiting for an Alibi]]\" and \"[[Do Anything You Want To]]\".\n[[File:Gary Moore - Manchester Apollo - 1985.jpg|thumb|left|220px|Moore performing at the Manchester Apollo, 1985]]\n\nHe experimented with many musical [[genre]]s, including rock, [[jazz]], [[blues]], [[country music|country]], [[electric blues]], [[hard rock]] and [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]].<ref>{{Citation  | title = Gary Moore Collaboration's  | url = http://www.gary-moore.com/Discography/Sessions/sessions.html  | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080206231242/http://www.gary-moore.com/Discography/Sessions/sessions.html  | archivedate = 6 February 2008  | accessdate =8 February 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn 1987, he  performed a guitar solo for a [[cover version|cover]] of [[the Beatles]]' \"[[Let It Be]]\". which was released under the group-name of [[Ferry Aid]]. The record raised substantial funds for the survivors of the ''[[MS Herald of Free Enterprise]]'' disaster. In 1990, he played the lead guitar solo on \"[[She's My Baby (Traveling Wilburys song)|She's My Baby]]\" from ''[[Traveling Wilburys Vol. 3]]''.\n\n[[File:Gary Moore 2010-11-23 01 25 9152.jpg|thumb|200px|Moore performing, 23 October 2010]]\nAfter a series of rock records, Moore returned to blues music with ''[[Still Got the Blues]]'' (1990), with contributions from [[Albert King]], [[Albert Collins]] and [[George Harrison]]. The album was well received by fans. He stayed with the blues format until 1997 when he returned to the harder rock, but with a softer, more pop and ballad-oriented sound on ''[[Dark Days in Paradise]]'' followed with another change of direction in 1999, when he decided to experiment with modern dance beats on ''[[A Different Beat (Gary Moore album)|A Different Beat]]''; this left many fans, as well as the music press, confused.  He also contributed guitar sections to [[Richard Blackwood]]'s 2000 album, ''You'll Love to Hate This''.\n\nWith ''[[Back to the Blues (Gary Moore album)|Back to the Blues]]'', Moore returned to his tried and tested blues format in 2001: he continued with this style on ''[[Power of the Blues]]'' (2004), ''[[Old New Ballads Blues]]'' (2006), ''[[Close As You Get]]'' (2007) and ''[[Bad For You Baby]]'' (2008).\n\nIn January 2005, Moore joined the [[One World Project]], which recorded a song for the 2004 Asian Tsunami relief effort. The group featured Russell Watson, Boy George, Steve Winwood, Barry Gibb, Brian Wilson, Cliff Richard, Dewey Bunnell, Gerry Beckley and Robin Gibb on vocals (in their order of appearance), and featured a guitar solo by Moore. The song, entitled \"Grief Never Grows Old\", was released in February 2005, reaching No.&nbsp;4 on the UK Singles Chart.<ref name=\"British Hit Singles & Albums 2\">{{Cite book\n| first= David\n| last= Roberts\n| year= 2006\n| title= British Hit Singles & Albums\n| edition= 19th\n| publisher=Guinness World Records Limited\n| location= London\n| isbn= 1-904994-10-5\n| page= 407}}</ref>\n\nHe also took part in a comedy skit entitled \"The Easy Guitar Book Sketch\" with comedian [[Rowland Rivron]] and fellow musicians [[Mark Knopfler]], [[Lemmy]] from Mot\u00f6rhead, [[Mark King (musician)|Mark King]] from Level 42, and [[David Gilmour]].{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}\n\nOther collaborations included a broad range of artists including [[Trilok Gurtu]], [[Dr. Strangely Strange]], [[Jimmy Nail]], [[Mo Foster]], [[Ginger Baker]], [[Jack Bruce]], [[Jim Capaldi]], [[B.B.

Since 1997, he was living with his partner, an artist named Jo, and their daughter Lily (b. 1999).

At the time, he was on holiday with a girlfriend at the Kempinski Hotel in [[Estepona]], Spain. After a quiet dinner, they went for a walk on the beach before going up to their room.
