His landmark recordings in 1936 and 1937 display a combination of singing, guitar skills, and songwriting talent that has influenced later generations of musicians. Johnson's shadowy, poorly documented life and [[27 Club|death at age 27]] have given rise to much legend, including the [[Faust]]ian myth that he sold his soul at a [[crossroads (mythology)|crossroads]] to achieve success. As an itinerant performer who played mostly on street corners, in [[juke joint]]s, and at Saturday night dances, Johnson had little commercial success or public recognition in his lifetime.\n\nJohnson's records sold poorly during his lifetime. It was only after the reissue of his recordings in 1961 on the LP ''[[King of the Delta Blues Singers]]'' that his work reached a wider audience. Johnson is now recognized as a master of the blues, particularly of the [[Mississippi]] [[Delta blues]] style. He is credited by many rock musicians as an important influence; [[Eric Clapton]] has called Johnson \"the most important blues singer that ever lived.\"<ref>{{Cite journal |title=The 50 albums that changed music |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2006/jul/16/popandrock.shopping |work=The Observer |location=UK |date=July 16, 2006 |accessdate=November 1, 2008  |postscript= <!--None-->}}</ref><ref>Booklet accompanying the ''Complete Recordings'' box set, Stephen LaVere, Sony Music Entertainment, 1990, Clapton quote on p. 26</ref> Johnson was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] as an \"Early Influence\" in their first induction ceremony in 1986.<ref name=\"rockandroll_halloffame\">[http://www.rockhall.com/inductee/robert-johnson \"Robert Johnson Inducted at: The 1986 Induction Ceremony\"].

Julia was married to Charles Dodds (born February 1865), a relatively prosperous landowner and furniture maker  with whom she had ten children. Charles Dodds had been forced by a mob to leave Hazlehurst following a dispute with white landowners. Julia left Hazlehurst with baby Robert but after some two years sent him to live in Memphis with her husband, who had changed his name to Charles Spencer.<ref>Guralnik pp. 10\u201311</ref>\n\nCirca 1919, Robert rejoined his mother in the [[Mississippi Delta]] area around [[Tunica, Mississippi|Tunica]] and [[Tunica Resorts, Mississippi|Robinsonville]]. Julia's new husband was known as Dusty Willis; he was 24 years her junior. Robert was remembered by some residents as \"Little Robert Dusty,\"<ref>Guralnik p.11</ref> but he was registered at Tunica's Indian Creek School as Robert Spencer. In the 1920 census he is listed as Robert Spencer, living in [[Lucas, Arkansas|Lucas]], [[Arkansas]] with Will and Julia Willis. Robert was at school in 1924 and 1927<ref name=\"Freeland 2000\"/> and the quality of his signature on his marriage certificate<ref>Wardlow (1998) p. 201</ref> suggests that he was relatively well educated for a boy of his background. One school friend, Willie Coffee, has been discovered and filmed, recalling that Robert was already noted for playing the harmonica and [[Jew's harp|jaw harp]].<ref>''Hellhounds on my Trail: The Afterlife of Robert Johnson'' quoted in Wald (2004) p.107</ref> He also remembers that Robert was absent for long periods, which suggests that he may have been living and studying in Memphis.<ref>Pearson & McCulloch p. 6.</ref>\n\nAfter school, Robert adopted the surname of his natural father, signing himself as Robert Johnson on the certificate of his marriage to sixteen-year-old Virginia Travis in February 1929. She died in childbirth shortly after.<ref>Wald (2004) p. 108</ref> Surviving relatives of Virginia told the blues researcher [[Robert \"Mack\" McCormick]] that this was a divine punishment for Robert's decision to sing secular songs, known as 'selling your soul to the Devil'. McCormick believes that Johnson himself accepted the phrase as a description of his resolve to abandon the settled life of a husband and farmer to become a full-time blues musician.<ref>The Search for Robert Johnson, 1992 film.</ref>\n\nAround this time, the noted blues musician [[Son House]] moved to Robinsonville where his musical partner, [[Willie Brown (musician)|Willie Brown]], lived. Late in life, House remembered Johnson as a 'little boy' who was a competent harmonica player but an embarrassingly bad guitarist. Soon after, Johnson left Robinsonville for the area around Martinsville, close to his birthplace [[Hazlehurst, Mississippi|Hazlehurst]], possibly searching for his natural father. Here he perfected the guitar style of Son House and learned other styles from Isaiah \"Ike\" Zinnerman.<ref>Pearson & McCulloch, p. 7.</ref> Ike Zinnerman was rumored to have learned supernaturally to play guitar by visiting graveyards at midnight.<ref>Pearson & McCulloch, p. 94.</ref>\nWhen Johnson next appeared in Robinsonville, he had seemed to have acquired a miraculous guitar technique.<ref>Guralnick p.15</ref> House was interviewed at a time when the legend of Johnson's pact with the Devil was well known among blues researchers. He was asked whether he attributed Johnson's technique to this pact, and his equivocal answers have been taken as confirmation.<ref name=\"Wardlow\" />\n\nWhile living in Martinsville, Johnson fathered a child with Vergie Mae Smith. He also married Caletta Craft in May 1931. In 1932, the couple moved to [[Clarksdale, Mississippi|Clarksdale]] in the Delta. Here Caletta died of childbirth and Johnson left for a career as a 'walking' (itinerant) musician.<ref>Pearson & McCulloch p. 7</ref>\n\n===Itinerant musician===\n[[File:Honeyboy Edwards (blues musician).jpg|alt=|thumb|150px|[[David \"Honeyboy\" Edwards]] was one of several blues guitarists whose testimony has been used to piece together Johnson's history.]]\nFrom 1932 until his death in 1938, Johnson moved frequently between large cities like [[Memphis, Tennessee]] and [[Helena, Arkansas]] and the smaller towns of the [[Mississippi Delta]] and neighboring regions of [[Mississippi]] and [[Arkansas]].<ref>Pearson & McCullock p.12</ref><ref>Gioia p. 172</ref> On occasion, he traveled much farther.

One was Estella Coleman, the mother of the blues musician [[Robert Lockwood, Jr.]] In other places he stayed with a woman seduced at his first performance.<ref>Guralnik p.24</ref><ref>Gioia p. 175</ref> In each location, Johnson's hosts were largely ignorant of his life elsewhere. He used different names in different places, employing at least eight distinct surnames.<ref>Gioia p. 172-173</ref>\n\nBiographers have looked for consistency from musicians who knew Johnson in different contexts: Shines, who traveled extensively with him; Lockwood who knew him as his mother's partner; [[David \"Honeyboy\" Edwards]] whose cousin Willie Mae Powell had a relationship with Johnson.<ref>Edwards p. 100</ref> From a mass of partial, conflicting, and inconsistent eye-witness accounts,<ref>Schroeder p. 22</ref>  biographers have attempted to summarize Johnson's character. \"He was well mannered, he was soft spoken, he was indecipherable\".<ref>Guralnik p. 29</ref> \"As for his character, everyone seems to agree that, while he was pleasant and outgoing in public, in private he was reserved and liked to go his own way\".<ref>Wald p. 112</ref> \"Musicians who knew Johnson testified that he was a nice guy and fairly average\u2014except, of course, for his musical talent, his weakness for whiskey and women, and his commitment to the road.\"<ref>Pearson & McCulloch p. 111</ref>\n\nWhen Johnson arrived in a new town, he would play for tips on street corners or in front of the local barbershop or a restaurant. Musical associates have said that in live performances Johnson often did not focus on his dark and complex original compositions, but instead pleased audiences by performing more well-known pop standards of the day<ref>{{cite news| url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE5D7113CF93BA15751C0A9629C8B63 | work=The New York Times | title=Revisionists Sing New Blues History | first=Ben | last=Sisario | date=February 28, 2004 | accessdate=May 22, 2010}}</ref>&nbsp;\u2013 and not necessarily blues. With an ability to pick up tunes at first hearing, Johnson had no trouble giving his audiences what they wanted, and certain of his contemporaries later remarked on Johnson's interest in jazz and country music. Johnson also had an uncanny ability to establish a rapport with his audience; in every town in which he stopped, Johnson would establish ties to the local community that would serve him well when he passed through again a month or a year later.\n\nFellow musician Shines was 17 when he met Johnson in 1933. He estimated Johnson was maybe a year older than himself. In Samuel Charters' ''Robert Johnson'', the author quotes Shines as saying:\n\n{{quote|\"Robert was a very friendly person, even though he was sulky at times, you know. And I hung around Robert for quite a while. One evening he disappeared. He was kind of a peculiar fellow. Robert'd be standing up playing some place, playing like nobody's business. At about that time it was a hustle with him as well as a pleasure. And money'd be coming from all directions. But Robert'd just pick up and walk off and leave you standing there playing. And you wouldn't see Robert no more maybe in two or three weeks ... So Robert and I, we began journeying off. I was just, matter of fact, tagging along''.\"}}\n\nDuring this time Johnson established what would be a relatively long-term relationship with Estella Coleman, a woman about fifteen years his senior and the mother of musician Robert Lockwood, Jr. Johnson reportedly cultivated a woman to look after him in each town he played in. Johnson supposedly asked homely young women living in the country with their families whether he could go home with them, and in most cases the answer was 'yes'...until a boyfriend arrived or Johnson was ready to move on.\n\nIn 1941, [[Alan Lomax]] learned from [[Muddy Waters]] that Johnson had performed in the [[Clarksdale, Mississippi]] area.<ref>Lomax (1993)</ref> By 1959, historian [[Samuel Charters]] could only add that [[Will Shade]] of the [[Memphis Jug Band]] remembered Johnson had once briefly played with him in [[West Memphis, Arkansas]].<ref>Charters (1959)</ref> In the last year of his life, Johnson is believed to have traveled to [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]] and possibly [[Illinois]], and then to some states in the East.\n\nIn 1938, [[Columbia Records]] producer [[John H. Hammond]], who owned some of Johnson's records, had record producer Don Law seek out Johnson to book him for the first \"[[From Spirituals to Swing]]\" concert at [[Carnegie Hall]] in New York. On learning of Johnson's death, Hammond replaced him with [[Big Bill Broonzy]], but still played two of Johnson's records from the stage.<ref>[http://www.jazzbymail.com/ViewAlbum.aspx?iPID=4237&iAID=1231&sPC=1231_4237&sLCD=VAN70169&sAN=Various%20Artists Jazz by Mail&nbsp;\u2013 Various Artists (From Spirituals to Swing)]</ref>\n\n===Recording sessions===\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| direction = vertical\n| header = Robert Johnson records\n| width = 150\n| image1 = Milkcow'sCalfBlues.jpg\n| alt1 = \n| image2 = LoveInVainBlues.jpg\n| alt2 = \n| image3 = IBelieveI'llDustMyBroom.jpg\n| alt3 = \n| caption3 = Johnson's recordings were released on several labels: \"Milkcow's Calf Blues\" on Perfect Records (top), \"Love in Vain Blues\" on [[Vocalion Records]] (middle), and \"I Believe I'll Dust My Broom\" by Conqueror Records (bottom)\n}}\nIn [[Jackson, Mississippi]], around 1936, Johnson sought out [[H. C. Speir]], who ran a general store and doubled as a talent scout. Speir put Johnson in touch with Ernie Oertle, who, as a salesman for the ARC group of labels, introduced Johnson to [[Don Law]] to record his first sessions in San Antonio, Texas. The recording session was held on November 23, 1936 in room 414 of the [[Gunter Hotel]] in San Antonio,<ref>San Antonio Express-News, November 30, 1986, \"Blues wizard's S.A.

In the ensuing three-day session, Johnson played sixteen selections, and recorded alternate takes for most of these. Johnson reportedly performed facing the wall, which has been cited as evidence he was a shy man and reserved performer. This conclusion was played up in the inaccurate liner notes of the 1961 album ''[[King of the Delta Blues Singers]]''. [[Ry Cooder]] speculates that Johnson played facing a corner to enhance the sound of the guitar, a technique he calls \"corner loading\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jasobrecht.com/ry-cooder-%E2%80%93-talking-country-blues-and-gospel/ |title=Ry Cooder&nbsp;\u2013 Talking Country Blues and Gospel |publisher=Jasobrecht.com |date= |accessdate=2011-12-30}}</ref>\n\nAmong the songs Johnson recorded in San Antonio were \"[[Come On In My Kitchen]]\", \"[[Kind Hearted Woman Blues]]\", \"[[Dust My Broom|I Believe I'll Dust My Broom]]\" and \"[[Cross Road Blues]]\". The first songs to appear were \"[[Terraplane Blues]]\" and \"Last Fair Deal Gone Down\", probably the only recordings of his that he would live to hear. \"Terraplane Blues\" became a moderate regional hit, selling 5,000 copies.\n\nHis first recorded song, \"Kind Hearted Woman Blues\", was part of a cycle of spin-offs and response songs that began with [[Leroy Carr]]'s \"Mean Mistreater Mama\" (1934). According to [[Elijah Wald|Wald]], it was \"the most musically complex in the cycle\"<ref name=Wald-131>Wald (2004), p. 131.</ref> and stood apart from most rural blues as a through-composed lyric, rather than an arbitrary collection of more-or-less unrelated verses.<ref>Wald (2004), p. 132, 176.</ref> In contrast to most Delta players, Johnson had absorbed the idea of fitting a composed song into the three minutes of a 78 rpm side.<ref>Wald (2004), p. 132.</ref> Most of Johnson's \"somber and introspective\" songs and performances come from his second recording session.<ref>Wald (2004), p. 167.</ref>\n\nIn 1937, Johnson traveled to [[Dallas, Texas]], for another recording session with Don Law in a makeshift studio at the Vitagraph (Warner Brothers) Building, 508 Park Avenue,<ref>[http://508park.org/][http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/20/us/dallas-church-preserving-the-legacy-of-robert-johnson.html?_r=0]</ref> where Brunswick Record Corporation was located on the third floor.<ref>''Eric Clapton&nbsp;\u2013 Sessions for Robert Johnson'', 2004 documentary and 1937 Worley\u2019s Dallas City Directory</ref> Eleven records from this session would be released within the following year. Johnson did two takes of most of these songs and recordings of those takes survived. Because of this, there is more opportunity to compare different performances of a single song by Johnson than for any other blues performer of his time and place.<ref>Wald (2004), p. 130.</ref>  Johnson recorded almost half of the 29 songs that make up his entire discography at the 508 Park Ave Building in Dallas, Texas.\n\nBy the time he died, at least six of his records had been released in the South as [[race records]].\n\n====Playback issues in extant recordings====\nThe accuracy of the pitch and speed of the extant recordings has been questioned. In ''[[The Guardian]]'''s music blog from May 2010, Jon Wilde speculated that recordings may have been \"accidentally speeded up when first committed to 78 [rpm records], or else were deliberately speeded up to make them sound more exciting.\"<ref>{{cite web | title=Robert Johnson revelation tells us to put the brakes on the blues | author=Jon Wilde | work=The Guardian | url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/musicblog/2010/may/27/robert-johnson-blues | date=May 27, 2010 | accessdate=June 5, 2010}}</ref> He does not give a source for this statement. Sony/Legacy music executive Lawrence Cohn, who won a [[Grammy]] for the label's 1991 reissue of Johnson's works, \"acknowledges there's a possibility Johnson's 1936\u201337 recordings were sped up, since the [[OKeh]]/[[Vocalion Records|Vocalion]] family of labels, which originally issued the material, was known to alter the speed of its releases. 'Sometimes it was 78 rpms, sometimes it was 81 rpms,' he says. It's impossible to check the original sources, since the metal stampers used to duplicate the original 78 discs disappeared years ago.\"<ref>{{cite web | title=Phonograph blues: Robert Johnson mastered at wrong speed? | author=Christopher Morris | work=Variety | url=http://www.varietysoundcheck.com/2010/05/phonograph-blues-robert-johnson-mastered-at-wrong-speed.html?ref=ssp | date=May 28, 2010 | accessdate=June 5, 2010}}</ref>\n\n===Death===\nJohnson died on August 16, 1938, at the age of 27, near [[Greenwood, Mississippi]]. Although the cause of death is still unknown, there have been a number of theories offered, based on several differing accounts about the events preceding his death.\n\nJohnson had been playing for a few weeks at a country dance in a town about {{convert|15|mi|km|0}} from Greenwood. According to one theory, Johnson was murdered by the jealous husband of a woman with whom he had flirted. In an account by fellow blues legend [[Sonny Boy Williamson II|Sonny Boy Williamson]], Johnson had been flirting with a married woman at a dance, where she gave him a bottle of whiskey poisoned by her husband. When Johnson took the bottle, Williamson knocked it out of his hand and advised him to never drink from a bottle that he had not personally seen opened. Johnson replied, \"Don't ever knock a bottle out of my hand.\" Soon after, he was offered another (poisoned) bottle and accepted it. Johnson is reported to have begun feeling ill the evening after and had to be helped back to his room in the early morning hours. Over the next three days his condition steadily worsened and witnesses reported that he died in a convulsive state of severe pain.  Musicologist [[Robert \"Mack\" McCormick]] claims to have tracked down the man who murdered Johnson, and to have obtained a confession from him in a personal interview, but has declined to reveal the man's name.<ref>''The Search for Robert Johnson,'' 1992 film.</ref>\n\nWhile [[strychnine]] has been suggested as the poison that killed Johnson,{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} at least one scholar has disputed the notion.  Tom Graves, in his book ''Crossroads: The Life and Afterlife of Blues Legend Robert Johnson'', relies on expert testimony from toxicologists to argue that strychnine has such a distinctive odor and taste that it cannot be disguised, even in strong liquor. Graves also claims that a significant amount of strychnine would have to be consumed in one sitting to be fatal, and that death from the poison would occur within hours, not days.<ref>{{cite book|title=Crossroads: The Life and Afterlife of Blues Legend Robert Johnson|first=Tom |last=Graves|first2= Steve |last2=LaVere|publisher=Demers Books LLC|year=2008 |pages=39\u201343 |url= |isbn=978-0-9816002-0-8 |quote=The tale most often told about how Johnson met his fate is that he was poisoned by a jealous husband who put strychnine in his whiskey.}}</ref><!-- for whole para so far--> Contemporary David \"Honeyboy\" Edwards similarly noted that the poison couldn't have been strychnine, since Johnson would have died much more rapidly, instead of suffering for three days.<ref>''[[Guitar World]]'' comment. {{citation needed|date=August 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn addition, LeFlore County Registrar Cornelia Jordan, after conducting an investigation into Johnson's death for the state director of Vital Statistics, R.N. Whitfield, wrote on Johnson's death certificate, \"I talked with the white man on whose place this negro died and I also talked with a negro woman on the place.  The plantation owner said the negro man, seemingly about 26 years old, came from Tunica two or three weeks before he died to play banjo at a negro dance given there on the plantation.  He staid[sic] in the house with some of the negroes saying he wanted to pick cotton.  The white man did not have a doctor for this negro as he had not worked for him.  He was buried in a homemade coffin furnished by the county.  The plantation owner said it was his opinion that the negro died of syphilis.\"<ref>http://blues.jfrewald.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/cert_back.jpg</ref> Mack McCormick made reference to Jordan's statement on Johnson's death certificate in an April 2012 episode of [[WNYC]]'s ''[[Radiolab]]''.<ref>http://www.radiolab.org/story/199705-crossroads/</ref>\n\n===Gravesite===\n[[File:TombstoneRobert Johnson.jpg|thumb|Alleged gravesite showing one of Robert Johnson's three tombstones]]\nThe exact location of his grave is officially unknown; three different markers have been erected at possible church cemetery burial sites outside of Greenwood.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://blackstone.carbonmade.com/projects/2027466#13/ |author=Blackstone, E.

A one-ton [[cenotaph]] in the shape of an [[obelisk]], listing all of Johnson's song titles, with a central inscription by [[Peter Guralnick]], was placed at this location in 1990, paid for by Columbia Records and numerous smaller contributions made through the [[Mt. Zion Memorial Fund]].\n*In 1990 a small marker with the epitaph \"Resting in the Blues\" was placed in the cemetery of Payne Chapel near [[Quito, Mississippi|Quito]] by an Atlanta rock group named the Tombstones, after they saw a photograph in ''Living Blues'' magazine of an unmarked spot alleged by one of Johnson's ex-girlfriends to be Johnson's burial site.<ref>Cheseborough, Steve (2008). ''Blues Traveling: The Holy Sites of Delta Blues''. Univ. Press of Mississippi. pp. 145\u2013146. ISBN 1604733284.</ref>\n*More recent research by Stephen LaVere (including statements from Rosie Eskridge, the wife of the supposed gravedigger) indicates that the actual grave site is under a big pecan tree in the cemetery of the Little Zion Church, north of Greenwood along Money Road. Sony Music has placed a marker at this site.\n\nAn interviewee in the documentary ''[[The Search for Robert Johnson]]'' (1991) suggests that owing to poverty and lack of transportation Johnson is most likely to have been buried in a pauper's grave (or \"[[Potters field|potter's field]]\") very near where he died.\n\n==Devil legend==\nAccording to legend, as a young man living on a plantation in rural Mississippi, Robert Johnson was branded with a burning desire to become a great blues musician. He was \"instructed\" to take his guitar to a crossroad near [[Dockery Plantation]] at midnight. There he was met by a large black man (the [[Devil]]) who took the guitar and [[Guitar tunings|tuned]] it. The \"Devil\" played a few songs and then returned the guitar to Johnson, giving him mastery of the instrument. This was in effect, a [[deal with the Devil]] mirroring the legend of [[Faust]]. In exchange for his soul, Robert Johnson was able to create the blues for which he became famous.<ref name=\"Radiolab Crossroads\">[http://www.radiolab.org/blogs/radiolab-blog/2012/apr/16/crossroads/ Radiolab Crossroads], The myth of what happened to Robert Johnson at the crossroads in Clarksdale, Mississippi.</ref>\n\n===Various accounts===\nThis legend was developed over time, and has been chronicled by [[Gayle Dean Wardlow]],<ref>Wardlow pp. 196\u2013201</ref> Edward Komara<ref>Wardlow pp 203\u20134</ref> and [[Elijah Wald]], who sees the legend as largely dating from Johnson's rediscovery by white fans more than two decades after his death.<ref>Wald. pp 265\u2013276</ref> [[Son House]] once told the story to [[Pete Welding]] as an explanation of Johnson's astonishingly rapid mastery of the guitar. Welding reported it as a serious belief in a widely read article in ''[[Down Beat]]'' in 1966.<ref>Whelan</ref> Other interviewers failed to elicit any confirmation from House and there were fully two years between House's observation of Johnson as first a novice and then a master.\n\nFurther details were absorbed from the imaginative retellings by [[Greil Marcus]]<ref>Marcus (1975)</ref> and [[Robert Palmer (writer)|Robert Palmer]].<ref>Palmer (1981)</ref> Most significantly, the detail was added that Johnson received his gift from a large black man at a crossroads. There is dispute as to how and when the crossroads detail was attached to the Robert Johnson story. All the published evidence, including a full chapter on the subject in the biography ''Crossroads'' by Tom Graves, suggests an origin in the story of Blues musician [[Tommy Johnson (blues musician)|Tommy Johnson]]. This story was collected from his musical associate [[Ishman Bracey]] and his elder brother Ledell in the 1960s.<ref>Wardlow (1998)</ref> One version of Ledell Johnson's account was published in [[David Evans (musicologist)|David Evans]]'s 1971 biography of Tommy,<ref>Evans (1971)</ref> and was repeated in print in 1982 alongside Son House's story in the widely read ''Searching for Robert Johnson.''<ref>Guralnik (1982)</ref>\n\nIn another version, Ledell placed the meeting not at a crossroads but in a graveyard. This resembles the story told to Steve LaVere that Ike Zinnerman of [[Hazlehurst, Mississippi]] learned to play the guitar at midnight while sitting on tombstones. Zinnerman is believed to have influenced the playing of the young Robert Johnson.<ref>Wardlow (1998) p. 197</ref>[[File:ClarksdaleMS Crossroads.jpg|right|thumb|The legendary \"Crossroads\" at Clarksdale, Mississippi]] Recent research by blues scholar [[Bruce Conforth]], in ''[[Living Blues]]'' magazine, makes the story clearer. Johnson and Ike Zimmerman did practice in a graveyard at night, because it was quiet and no one would disturb them, but it was not the Hazlehurst cemetery as had been believed. Zimmerman (his actual name as it was reportedly spelled on census records for the family going back into the early 1800s, his social security card, social security death notice, funeral program, and by his daughters) was not from Hazlehurst but nearby [[Beauregard, Mississippi|Beauregard]].

In an essay published in 1999, ''Demythologizing the Blues'', Evans wrote:\n\n{{quote|\"There are... several serious problems with this crossroads myth.

Well, this is it.\"<ref>[http://www.timeisonourside.com/STNon-Chicago.html \"The salt of the earth: 1930s\u20131940s\u2014Pre-electric non-Chicago blues\"] from liner notes to Johnson's ''[[The Complete Recordings (Robert Johnson album)|The Complete Recordings]]'', released on [[Columbia Records|Columbia]] in 1990.</ref> But according to [[Elijah Wald]], in his book ''Escaping the Delta'', Johnson in his own time was most respected for his ability to play in such a wide variety of styles\u2014from raw country [[slide guitar]] to jazz and pop licks\u2014and to pick up guitar parts almost instantly upon hearing a song.<ref>Wald (2004), p. 127</ref> His first recorded song, \"Kind Hearted Woman Blues,\" in contrast to the prevailing Delta style of the time, more resembled the style of [[Chicago blues|Chicago]] or [[St. Louis blues (music)|St. Louis]], with \"a full-fledged, abundantly varied musical arrangement.\"<ref>Wald (2004), p. 133.</ref> Unusual for a Delta player of the time, a recording exhibits what Johnson could do entirely outside of a blues style. \"They're Red Hot,\" from his first recording session, shows that he was also comfortable with an \"uptown\" [[swing music|swing]] or [[ragtime]] sound similar to the [[Harlem Hamfats]] but, as Wald remarks, \"no record company was heading to Mississippi in search of a down-home [[Ink Spots]] ... [H]e could undoubtedly have come up with a lot more songs in this style if the producers had wanted them.\"<ref>Wald (2004), p. 152\u2013154.</ref>\n\n{{quote|\"To the uninitiated, Johnson's recordings may sound like just another dusty Delta blues musician wailing away.

These subtle inflections of [[Pitch (music)|pitch]] help explain why his singing conveys such powerful emotion. [[Eric Clapton]] described Johnson's music as \"the most powerful cry that I think you can find in the human voice.\" In two takes of \"Me and the Devil Blues\" he shows a high degree of precision in the complex vocal delivery of the last verse: \"The range of tone he can pack into a few lines is astonishing.\"<ref>Wald (2004), p. 178\u2013179.</ref> The song's \"hip humor and sophistication\" is often overlooked. \"[G]enerations of blues writers in search of wild Delta primitivism,\" writes Wald, have been inclined to overlook or undervalue aspects that show Johnson as a polished professional performer.<ref name=Wald-177 />\n\nJohnson is also known for using the guitar as 'the other vocalist in the song', a technique later perfected by [[B. B. King]] and his personified guitar known as '[[Lucille (guitar)|Lucille]]':<ref>\"[http://thestory.org/archive/the_story_110411_full_show.mp3/view From The Diddy Bow To Bo Diddley]\" Dick Gordon interviewing Bill Ferris on 'The Story' with Dick Gordon; November 04 2011.</ref>\n\n{{quote|\". . in Africa and in Afro-American tradition, there is the tradition of the talking instrument, beginning with the drums . . the [[One Strand Blues|one-strand]] and then the six-strings with bottleneck-style performance; it becomes a competing voice . . or a complementary voice . . in the performance . . \"|Bill Ferris|[[American Public Media]]: [[The Story with Dick Gordon]]<ref name=\"thestory1\"/>}}\n\n[[Bob Dylan]] wrote that \"When Johnson started singing, he seemed like a guy who could have sprung from the head of Zeus in full armor. I immediately differentiated between him and anyone else I had ever heard. The songs weren't customary blues songs. They were so utterly fluid. At first they went by quick, too quick to even get. They jumped all over the place in range and subject matter, short punchy verses that resulted in some panoramic story-fires of mankind blasting off the surface of this spinning piece of plastic.\"<ref>''[[Chronicles: Volume One]]'', p. 282</ref>\n\n===Instrument===\nJohnson mastered the guitar, being considered today one of the all-time greats on the instrument. His approach was highly complex and extremely advanced musically. When [[Keith Richards]] was first introduced to Johnson's music by his bandmate [[Brian Jones]], he replied, \"Who is the other guy playing with him?\", not realizing it was Johnson playing on one guitar.  \"I was hearing two guitars, and it took a long time to actually realise he was doing it all by himself,\"<ref name=\"The Independent\">Buncombe, Andrew.

You know, 'my car doesn't run, I'm gonna check my oil' ... 'if you don't like my apples, don't shake my tree'.  Every verse has sexuality associated with it.\"}}\n\n==Influences==\nJohnson fused approaches specific to Delta blues to those from the broader music world. The slide guitar work on \"Rambling on My Mind\" is pure Delta and Johnson's vocal there has \"a touch of ... Son House rawness,\" but the train imitation on the bridge is not at all typical of Delta blues, and is more like something out of [[minstrel show]] music or [[vaudeville]].<ref>Wald (2004), p. 139.</ref>  Johnson did record versions of \"Preaching the Blues\" and \"Walking Blues\" in the older bluesman's vocal and guitar style (House's chronology is questioned by Guralnick). As with the first take of \"Come On In My Kitchen,\" the influence of Skip James is evident in James's \"Devil Got My Woman\", but the lyrics rise to the level of first-rate poetry, and Johnson sings with a strained voice found nowhere else in his recorded output.<ref>Wald (2004), p. 171\u2013172.</ref>\n\nThe sad, romantic \"Love in Vain\" successfully blends several of Johnson's disparate influences. The form, including the wordless last verse, follows Leroy Carr's last hit \"When the Sun Goes Down\"; the words of the last sung verse come directly from a song [[Blind Lemon Jefferson]] recorded in 1926.<ref>Wald (2004), p. 183.</ref>  Johnson's last-ever recording, \"Milkcow's Calf Blues\" is his most direct tribute to Kokomo Arnold, who wrote \"Milkcow Blues\" and who influenced Johnson's vocal style.<ref>Wald (2004), p. 184.</ref>\n\n\"[[From Four Until Late]]\" shows Johnson's mastery of a blues style not usually associated with the Delta. He [[crooner|croons]] the lyrics in a manner reminiscent of [[Lonnie Johnson (musician)|Lonnie Johnson]], and his guitar style is more that of a [[ragtime]]-influenced player like [[Blind Blake]].<ref name=Wald-170-171>Wald (2004), p. 170\u2013171, 174.</ref> Lonnie Johnson's influence on Robert Johnson is even clearer in two other departures from the usual Delta style: \"Malted Milk\" and \"Drunken Hearted Man\". Both copy the arrangement of Lonnie Johnson's \"Life Saver Blues\".<ref>Wald (2004), p. 175.</ref>  The two takes of \"Me and the Devil Blues\" show the influence of [[Peetie Wheatstraw]], calling into question the interpretation of this piece as \"the spontaneous heart-cry of a demon-driven folk artist.\"<ref name=Wald-177>Wald (2004), p. 177.</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\nRobert Johnson has had enormous impact on music and musicians\u2014but outside his own time, place, and even genre for which he was famous. His influence on contemporaries was much smaller, due in part to the fact that he was an itinerant performer\u2014playing mostly on street corners, in [[juke joint]]s, and at Saturday night dances\u2014who worked in a then undervalued style of music. He also died young after recording only a handful of songs. Johnson, though well-traveled and admired in his performances, was little noted in his lifetime, his records even less so. \"[[Terraplane Blues]]\", sometimes described as Johnson's only hit record, outsold his others, but was still only a minor success.\n\nIf one had asked black blues fans about Robert Johnson in the first twenty years after his death, writes [[Elijah Wald]], \"the response in the vast majority of cases would have been a puzzled 'Robert who?'\"  This lack of recognition extended to black musicians:\n\n{{quote|\"As far as the evolution of [[African-American music|black music]] goes, Robert Johnson was an extremely minor figure, and very little that happened in the decades following his death would have been affected if he had never played a note.\"<ref>Wald, 2004</ref>}}\n\nWith the album ''[[King of the Delta Blues Singers]]'', a compilation of Johnson's recordings released in 1961, [[Columbia Records]] introduced his work to a much wider audience\u2014fame and recognition he only received long after his death.\n\n===Rock and roll===\nJohnson's major influence has been on genres of music that weren\u2019t recognized as such until long after his death:  [[rock and roll]] and rock. The [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] included four of his songs in a set of 500<ref name=500STS>{{cite web |url=http://rockhall.com/exhibits/500-songs-that-shaped-rock-and/ |title=Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll| publisher=Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum |year=2007}}</ref> they deemed to have shaped the genre:\n\n*\u201c[[Sweet Home Chicago]]\u201d (1936)\n*\u201c[[Cross Road Blues]]\u201d (1936)\n*\u201c[[Hellhound on My Trail]]\u201d (1937)\n*\u201c[[Love in Vain]]\u201d (1937)\n\nJohnson recorded these songs a decade and a half before the recognized [[Origins of rock and roll|advent of rock and roll]],<ref>[http://www.esto.es/rock/english/history.htm 50' The Beginnings of Rock and Roll] Education Department, Saatchi Gallery Contemporary Art in London.</ref> dying a year or two later. The Museum inducted him as an \u201cEarly Influence\u201d in their first induction ceremony in 1986, almost a half century after his death. Marc Meyers of the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' wrote that, \"His 'Stop Breakin' Down Blues' from 1937 is so far ahead of its time that the song could easily have been a rock demo cut in 1954.\"<ref name=\"Marc Myers 2011\"/>\n\n===Rock music and related genres===\nMany of the artists who claim to have been influenced by Johnson the most, injecting his revolutionary stylings into their work and recording tribute songs and collections, are prominent rock musicians from the United Kingdom. His impact and influence on these future star musicians from England\u2014who would then come to develop and define both the [[rock and roll]] and rock music eras\u2014resulted not from personal appearances or direct fraternization. Instead, the artistic power of his exceptional talents and original compositions would be relayed across the Atlantic many years after his death through the compilation of his works released in 1961 by Columbia Records (''[[King of the Delta Blues Singers]]'').\n\n[[Brian Jones]] of the [[Rolling Stones]] introduced bandmate [[Keith Richards]] to his first Robert Johnson album. The blues master's recordings would have as much impact on him as on [[Mick Jagger]]. The group would perform his \"[[Walkin' Blues]]\" at the [[Rock and Roll Circus]] in 1968. They arranged their own version of \"[[Love in Vain]]\" for their album ''[[Let It Bleed]]''; recording \"[[Stop Breakin' Down Blues]]\" for ''[[Exile on Main Street]]''. In addition, [[Mick Jagger]], in his role as Turner in the 1970 film ''[[Performance]]'', performs solo excerpts from \"[[Come On In My Kitchen]]\" and \"[[Me and the Devil Blues]].\"\n\n[[Alexis Korner]], referred to as \"the Founding Father of British Blues\", co-wrote and recorded a song entitled \"Robert Johnson\" on his ''[[The Party Album (Alexis Korner)|The Party Album]]'' released in 1978. Other examples of the influence he had on English blues and [[Blues rock|blues-rock]] musicians and musical groups include:\n\n*[[Eric Clapton]], founder and member of many legendary groups, considered Johnson \"the most important blues musician who ever lived.\"<ref name=\"The Independent\"/> He recorded enough of his songs to make ''[[Me and Mr. Johnson]]'', a blues-rock album released in 2004 as a tribute to the legendary bluesman (also made into the film ''Sessions for Robert J''). He'd earlier recorded \"Crossroads\", an arrangement of \"[[Cross Road Blues]]\", with [[Cream (band)|Cream]] in 1968, leading some to consider him \"the man largely responsible for making Robert Johnson a household name.\"<ref>\"[http://www.npr.org/local/stories/KPLU/149258634 Bo Diddley's 'Before You Accuse Me' influential as the master]\" Listen to the Story, KPLU 88.5; March 23, 2012.</ref>\n*[[Robert Plant]] of [[Led Zeppelin]] referred to him on [[National Public Radio|NPR]]'s ''Fresh Air'' (recorded in 2004) as \u201cRobert Johnson, to whom we all owed our existence, in some way.\u201d  His group recorded \"[[Traveling Riverside Blues]]\", a song that drew from Johnson's original and quoted a number of Johnson's songs in the lyrics.\n*[[Fleetwood Mac]] were strongly influenced by Johnson in the group's early years as a British blues band. Guitarist [[Jeremy Spencer]] contributed two covers of Johnson-derived songs to the group's early albums, and lead guitarist [[Peter Green (musician)|Peter Green]] would later go on to record Johnson's entire catalog over the course of two albums, ''[[The Robert Johnson Songbook]]'' and ''[[Hot Foot Powder (album)|Hot Foot Powder]]''.\n\n[[Sam Dunn]]'s documentary ''[[Metal Evolution]]'' cites that Robert Johnson was the \"great grandfather to all things heavy metal\" with members of [[Rush (band)|Rush]] and [[Slipknot (band)|Slipknot]] agreeing that he played a major role in the future of rock music.\n\n[[Bob Dylan]] wrote of Johnson in his 2004 autobiography ''[[Chronicles: Volume One]]'', \"If I hadn't heard the Robert Johnson record when I did, there probably would have been hundreds of lines of mine that would have been shut down&mdash;that I wouldn't have felt free enough or upraised enough to write.\"<ref>''[[Chronicles: Volume One]]'', pp. 287-288</ref>\n\n===Guitar technique===\n[[File:Robert-Johnson-Gibson L1.jpg|alt=|thumb|Johnson was photographed with an L-1 from [[Gibson Guitar Company]].
