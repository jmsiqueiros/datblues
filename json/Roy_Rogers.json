Known as the \"King of the Cowboys\", he appeared in over 100 films and numerous radio and television episodes of ''[[The Roy Rogers Show]]''. In many of his films and television episodes, he appeared with his wife [[Dale Evans]], his golden palomino [[Trigger (horse)|Trigger]], and his [[German Shepherd dog]] Bullet. His show ran on radio for nine years before moving to television from 1951 through 1957. His productions usually featured a [[sidekick]], often [[Pat Brady]], [[Andy Devine]], or [[George \"Gabby\" Hayes]]. In his later years, Rogers lent his name to the [[Roy Rogers Restaurants]] franchised chain. \n\n==Biography==\n===Early life===\nRoy Rogers was born '''Leonard Franklin Slye''' on November 5, 1911 to Mattie (n\u00e9e Womack) and Andrew \"Andy\" Slye in [[Cincinnati]], Ohio.<ref name=\"rr-bio\">{{cite web|last=Zwisohn |first=Laurence |title=Happy Trails: The Life of Roy Rogers |publisher=Roy Rogers |url=http://www.royrogers.com/roy_rogers_bio.html |accessdate=April 29, 2014}}</ref> The family lived in a tenement building on 2nd Street, where [[Riverfront Stadium]] would later be constructed (Rogers would later joke that he was born at second base).<ref name=\"rr-bio\"/> Dissatisfied with his job and city life, Andy and his brother Will built a 12-by-50-foot houseboat from salvage lumber, and in July 1912 the Slye family traveled up the [[Ohio River]] towards [[Portsmouth, Ohio]].<ref name=\"rr-bio\"/> Desiring a more stable existence in Portsmouth, they purchased land on which to build a house, but the [[Great Flood of 1913]] allowed them to move the houseboat to their property and continue living in it on dry land.<ref name=\"rr-bio\"/>\n\n[[File:Roy Rogers Boyhood Home at Duck Run.jpg|thumb|Roy Rogers' boyhood home at Duck Run near Lucasville, Ohio]]\nIn 1919 the Slye family purchased a farm in Duck Run, located near [[Lucasville, Ohio]] about 12 miles north of Portsmouth, and built a six-room house.<ref name=\"rr-bio\"/> Andy Slye soon realized that the farm alone would provide insufficient income for his family, so he took a job at a Portsmouth shoe factory, living in Portsmouth during the week and returning home on weekends bearing gifts following paydays. A notable gift was a horse on which young Len Slye learned the basics of horsemanship.<ref name=\"rr-bio\"/> Living on the farm with no radio, the family made their own entertainment. On Saturday nights, the family often invited neighbors over for square dances, during which Len would sing, play mandolin, and call the square dances.<ref name=\"rr-bio\"/> He also learned to yodel during this time, and he and his mother would use yodeling calls to communicate with each other across distances on the farm.<ref name=\"rr-bio\"/>\n\nAfter completing the eighth grade, Len attended high school in [[McDermott, Ohio]].<ref name=\"rr-bio\"/> After completing his second year in high school, his family returned to Cincinnati, where his father began work at another shoe factory.<ref name=\"rr-bio\"/> Realizing that his family needed his financial help, Len quit school and joined his father at the shoe factory.<ref name=\"rr-bio\"/> He tried to attend night school, but after being ridiculed for falling asleep in class, he quit school and never returned.\n\nBy 1929, after Len's older sister Mary and her husband moved to [[Lawndale, California]], he and his father quit their factory jobs, packed up their 1923 Dodge, and drove the family to California to visit Mary. They stayed for four months before returning to Ohio.<ref name=\"rr-bio\"/> Soon after returning, Len had the opportunity to travel to California with Mary's father-in-law, and the rest of the family followed in the spring of 1930. The Slye family rented a small house near Mary, and Len and his father found employment driving gravel trucks for a highway-construction project.<ref name=\"rr-bio\"/>\n\nIn the spring of 1931, after the construction company went bankrupt, Len traveled to [[Tulare, California]] where he found work picking peaches for [[Del Monte Foods|Del Monte]].<ref name=\"rr-bio\"/> During this time he lived in a labor camp similar to the ones depicted in John Steinbeck's novel ''[[The Grapes Of Wrath]]''.<ref name=\"rr-bio\"/> The economic hardship of the [[Great Depression]] was just as severe in California as it was in Ohio. \n\n===Music career===\nAfter returning to Lawndale, Slye's sister Mary suggested that he audition for the Midnight Frolic radio program, which broadcast over KMCS in [[Inglewood, California|Inglewood]]. A few nights later, wearing a Western shirt that Mary made for him, Slye overcame his shyness and appeared on the program playing guitar, singing, and yodeling.<ref name=\"rr-bio\"/> A few days later, he was asked to join a local country music group called The Rocky Mountaineers.<ref name=\"rr-bio\"/> Slye accepted the group's offer and became a member in August of 1931.<ref name=\"rr-bio\"/><ref>Green, p. 74.</ref>\n\nBy September 1931, Slye hired Canadian-born [[Bob Nolan]] who answered the group's classified ad in the ''Los Angeles Herald-Examiner'' that read, \"Yodeler for old-time act, to travel. Tenor preferred.\" Although Nolan stayed with the group only a short time, he and Slye stayed in touch. Nolan was replaced by [[Tim Spencer (singer)|Tim Spencer]].<ref name=\"cmt\">{{cite web|title=Sons of the Pioneers |url=http://www.cmt.com/artists/az/sons_of_the_pioneers/bio.jhtml |publisher=Country Music Television |accessdate=April 29, 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn the spring of 1932, Slye, Spencer, and another singer, Slumber Nichols, left the Rocky Mountaineers to form a trio, which soon failed. Throughout that year, Slye and Spencer moved through a series of short-lived groups, including the International Cowboys and the O-Bar-O Cowboys. When Spencer left the O-Bar-O Cowboys to take a break from music, Slye joined Jack LeFevre and His Texas Outlaws, who were a popular act on a local Los Angeles radio station.<ref>Green, p. 75.</ref>\n\nIn early 1933, Slye, Nolan, and Spencer formed a group called the Pioneers Trio, with Slye on guitar, Nolan on string bass, and Spencer on lead vocals. The three rehearsed for weeks refining their vocal harmonies. During this time, Slye continued to work with his radio singing group, while Spencer and Nolan began writing songs for the trio.<ref name=\"cmt\"/> In early 1934, fiddle player Hugh Farr joined the group, adding a bass voice to the group's vocal arrangements. Later that year, the Pioneers Trio became the [[Sons of the Pioneers]] when a radio station announcer changed their name because he felt they were too young to be \"pioneers\". The name was received well and fit the group, who were no longer a trio.<ref name=\"cmt\"/>\n\nBy the summer of 1934, the popularity and fame of the Sons of the Pioneers extended beyond the Los Angeles area and quickly spread across the country through short syndicated radio segments that were later rebroadcast across the United States. After signing a recording contract with the newly founded [[Decca Records|Decca]] label, the Sons of the Pioneers made their first commercial recording on August 8, 1934.<ref name=\"cmt\"/> One of the first songs recorded by the group during that first August session was \"[[Tumbling Tumbleweeds]]\" written by Bob Nolan. Over the next two years the Sons of the Pioneers would record 32 songs for Decca, including the classic \"[[Cool Water]]\".<ref name=\"encyclopedia\">{{cite web|title=Sons of the Pioneers |url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G2-3430600069.html |publisher=''Encyclopedia.com'' |accessdate=August 27, 2011}}</ref>\n\n===Film career===\n[[File:Lynne Roberts-Roy Rogers in Billy the Kid Returns.jpg|thumb|Lynne Roberts and Roy Rogers in ''Billy the Kid Returns'', 1938]]\nFrom his first film appearance in 1935, he worked steadily in [[Western (genre)|Western]] films, including a large supporting role as a singing cowboy while still billed as \"Leonard Slye\" in a [[Gene Autry]] movie. In 1938, when Autry temporarily walked out on his movie contract, Slye was immediately rechristened \"Roy Rogers\". Slye's stage name was suggested by Republic Picture's staff after [[Will Rogers]] and the shortening of Leroy. and assigned the lead in ''[[Under Western Stars]]''. Rogers became a matinee idol and American legend. A competitor for Gene Autry as the nation's favorite [[singing cowboy]] was suddenly born. In addition to his own movies, Rogers played a supporting role in the [[John Wayne]] classic ''[[Dark Command]]'' (1940). Rogers became a major box office attraction.\n\n[[File:Roy Rogers - Hart - 1938.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Publicity photo of Roy Rogers and Mary Hart for ''[[Shine On, Harvest Moon (1938 film)|Shine On, Harvest Moon]]'', 1938]]\nIn the ''Motion Picture Herald'' Top Ten Money-Making Western Stars poll, Rogers was listed for 15 consecutive years from 1939 to 1954, holding first place from 1943 to 1954.<ref>{{cite book|last=Hardy|first=Phil|title=The Encyclopedia of Western Movies|year=1984|publisher=Woodbury Press|location=Minneapolis, MN|isbn=978-0-8300-0405-8}}</ref> He appeared in the similar ''Box Office'' poll from 1938 to 1955, holding first place from 1943 to 1952. (In the final three years of that poll he was second only to Randolph Scott.)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.b-westerns.com/terms5.htm |title=Motion Picture Herald and Boxoffice Polls |publisher=B-westerns.com |accessdate=October 31, 2011}}</ref> Although these two polls are really an indication only of the popularity of series stars, Rogers also appeared in the ''Top Ten Money Makers Poll'' of all films in 1945 and 1946.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.quigleypublishing.com/MPalmanac/Top10/Top10_lists.html |title=Top Ten Money Making Stars |publisher=Quigleypublishing.com |accessdate=2013-08-09}}</ref>\n\nRogers was an idol for many children through his films and television shows. Most of his postwar films were in [[Trucolor]] during an era when almost all other [[B westerns]] were black-and-white. Some of his movies would segue into animal adventures, in which Rogers's horse Trigger would go off on his own for a while, with the camera following him.\n\nWith money from not only Rogers' films but his own public appearances going to Republic Pictures, Rogers brought a clause into a 1940 contract with the studio where he would have the right to his likeness, voice and name for merchandising.<ref>Phillips, 38</ref> There were Roy Rogers [[action figure]]s, cowboy adventure novels, and [[playset]]s, as well as a comic strip, a long-lived [[Dell Comics]] comic book series (''Roy Rogers Comics'') written by [[Gaylord Du Bois]], and a variety of marketing successes. Roy Rogers was second only to Walt Disney in the amount of items featuring his name.<ref>Enss/Kazanjian, 132</ref>\n\n[[File:Sons-of-the-Pioneers-1946.jpg|thumb|Rogers and the [[Sons of the Pioneers]] in ''[[Rainbow Over Texas]]'', 1946]]\nThe Sons of the Pioneers continued their popularity, and they have never stopped performing from the time Rogers started the group, replacing members as they retired or passed away (all original members are deceased). Although Rogers was no longer an active member, they often appeared as Rogers' backup group in films, radio, and television, and Rogers would occasionally appear with them in performances up until his death. In August 1950, Evans and Rogers had a daughter, Robin Elizabeth, who had [[Down Syndrome]] and died of complications with [[mumps]] shortly before her second birthday. Evans wrote about losing their daughter in her book ''[[Angel Unaware]]''.\n\nRogers and Evans were also well known as advocates for [[adoption]] and as founders and operators of children's charities. They adopted several children. Both were outspoken Christians. In [[Apple Valley, California]], where they made their home, numerous streets and highways as well as civic buildings have been named after them in recognition of their efforts on behalf of homeless and handicapped children. Rogers was an active [[Freemason]] and a [[Shriner]], and was noted for his support of their charities.\n\n[[File:Roy Rogers and Gail Davis 1948.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Publicity photo of Roy Rogers and Gail Davis, 1948]]\nRogers and Evans's famous theme song, \"[[Happy Trails (song)|Happy Trails]]\", was written by Evans; they sang it as a duet to sign off their television show. In the fall of 1962, the couple co-hosted a comedy-western-variety program, ''[[The Roy Rogers and Dale Evans Show]],'' aired on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]. It was cancelled after three months, losing in the ratings to ''[[The Jackie Gleason Show]]'' on [[Columbia Broadcasting Company|CBS]]. He also made numerous cameo or guest appearances on other popular television shows, starring as himself or other cowboy-type characters, such as in an episode of ''[[Wonder Woman (TV series)|Wonder Woman]]'' called \"[[List of Wonder Woman episodes|The Bushwackers]]\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thewb.com/shows/wonder-woman/pilot-the-new-original-wonder-woman/b6dad16f-4e16-41f0-8534-590f88ef6c44 |title=Wonder Woman : Pilot: The New Original Wonder Woman |publisher=Thewb.com |accessdate=October 31, 2011}}</ref> Rogers also owned a Hollywood production company which handled his own series. It also filmed other undertakings, including the 1955\u20131956 CBS western series ''[[Brave Eagle]]'' starring [[Keith Larsen]] as a young peaceful [[Cheyenne]] chief, [[Kim Winona]] as Morning Star, his romantic interest, and the [[Hopi]] Indian [[Anthony Numkena]] as Keena, Brave Eagle's foster son.\n\nIn 1968, Rogers licensed his name to the Marriott corporation, which converted its Hot Shoppes locations to Roy Rogers Restaurants, with which Rogers otherwise had no involvement.\n\nRogers owned a [[Thoroughbred]] [[horse racing|racehorse]] named [[Triggairo]], who won 13 career races including the 1975 [[El Encino Stakes]] at [[Santa Anita Park]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pedigreequery.com/triggairo |title=Triggairo Horse Pedigree |publisher=Pedigree Online Thoroughbred Database |accessdate=October 31, 2011}}</ref>\n\n===Personal life===\n[[File:RoyRogersDaleEvansKBF1970s.jpg|thumb|upright|Roy Rogers and [[Dale Evans]] at Knott's Berry Farm in the 1970s]]\nIn 1932 a palomino colt foaled in California was named \"Golden Cloud\"; when Len acquired him, he renamed him \"[[Trigger (horse)|Trigger]]\". Len then went on tour with the \"O-Bar-O Cowboys\" and in June 1933 met Grace Arline Wilkins at a [[Roswell, New Mexico]] radio station. She traded Len a lemon pie for his singing \"Swiss Yodel\" over the air. They were married in Roswell, New Mexico on June 11, 1936 after having corresponded since their first meeting.<ref name=\"bio\"/> In 1941, the couple adopted a girl, Cheryl Darlene. Two years later, Arline bore daughter Linda Lou. She bore Roy Jr. (\"Dusty\") in 1946, but died of complications from the birth a few days later, on November 3.\n\nRogers had met Dale Evans in 1944 when they were cast in a film together. They fell in love soon after Arline's death and Rogers proposed to her during a rodeo at [[Chicago Stadium]]. They married on New Year's Eve in 1947 at the Flying L Ranch in [[Davis, Oklahoma]], where they had filmed ''[[Home in Oklahoma]]'' a few months earlier. They stayed married until Rogers's death in 1998.<ref name=\"bio\">Phillips, 13-15</ref>\n\nRogers was a [[Freemason]] and was a member of Hollywood (CA) Lodge #355, the Scottish Rite Valley of Los Angeles, and Al Malaikah Shrine Temple.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.nymasons.org/about-freemasonry/famous-masons-i.html | publisher= MWGLNY| title= Famous Masons |date=January 2014 }}</ref>\n\n===Death===\nWhen Rogers died of [[Heart failure|congestive heart failure]] on July 6, 1998, he was residing in [[Apple Valley, California]].
