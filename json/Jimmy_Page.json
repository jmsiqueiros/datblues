He was a member of [[the Yardbirds]] from 1966 to 1968. In late 1968, he founded Led Zeppelin.\n\nPage is widely considered to be one of the greatest and most influential guitarists of all time.{{sfn|George-Warren|2001|p=773}}{{sfn|Gulla|2009|p=151}}<ref name=allmusicpage>{{cite web|last=Prato|first=Greg|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/jimmy-page-mn0000089021|title=Jimmy Page Biography|publisher=[[AllMusic]]|accessdate=11 November 2008}}</ref> ''[[Rolling Stone (magazine)|Rolling Stone]]'' magazine has described Page as \"the pontiff of power riffing\" and ranked him number 3 in their list of the \"100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time\".

He was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] twice; once as a member of the Yardbirds (1992) and once as a member of Led Zeppelin (1995). Page has been described by ''[[Uncut (magazine)|Uncut]]'' as \"rock's greatest and most mysterious guitar hero.\" ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' magazine voted Jimmy Page the 2nd Greatest Guitarist of all time.\n{{toclimit|3}}\n\n==Early life==\nJimmy Page was born to James Patrick Page and Patricia Elizabeth Page (n\u00e9e Gaffikin){{Sfn|Davis|1985}} in the west London suburb of [[Heston]], which today forms part of the [[London Borough of Hounslow]]. His father was an industrial personnel manager and his mother, who was of Irish descent,{{Sfn|Case|2007|p=5}} was a doctor's secretary. In 1952, they moved to [[Feltham]] and then to Miles Road, [[Epsom]] in [[Surrey]], which is where Page came across his first guitar. \"I don't know whether [the guitar] was left behind by the people [in the house] before [us], or whether it was a friend of the family's\u2014nobody seemed to know why it was there.\"<ref>[[Charles Shaar Murray]], \"The Guv'nors\", ''[[Mojo magazine|Mojo]]'', August 2004, p. 67.</ref> First playing the instrument at age twelve,<ref name=PP75>{{cite web|last=Crowe|first=Cameron|authorlink=Cameron Crowe|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/the-durable-led-zeppelin-19750313|title=The Durable Led Zeppelin|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=13 March 1975|accessdate=16 December 2012}}</ref> he took a few lessons in nearby [[Kingston upon Thames|Kingston]], but was largely self-taught:\n\n<blockquote>When I grew up there weren't many other guitarists&nbsp;...

The group played \"Mama Don't Want to Skiffle Anymore\" and another American-flavoured song, \"In Them Ol' Cottonfields Back Home.\" When asked by Wheldon what he wanted to do after schooling, Page said, \"I want to do biological research\" to find a cure for \"cancer, if it isn't discovered by then.\"\n\nIn an interview with ''[[Guitar Player]]'' magazine, Page stated that \"there was a lot of [[Street performance|busking]] in the early days, but as they say, I had to come to grips with it and it was a good schooling.\"<ref name=\"JPinterview\" /> Page took a guitar to school each day only to have it confiscated and returned to him after class.{{Sfn|Kendall|1981|p=11}} Although interviewed for a job as a laboratory assistant, he ultimately chose to leave Danetree Secondary School, West [[Ewell]], to pursue music.{{Sfn|Kendall|1981|p=11}}\n\nInitially, Page had difficulty finding other musicians with whom he could play on a regular basis. \"It wasn't as though there was an abundance. I used to play in many groups&nbsp;... anyone who could get a gig together, really.\"<ref name = Schulps /> Following stints backing recitals by Beat poet [[Royston Ellis]] at the [[Mermaid Theatre]] between 1960\u201361,{{sfn|Case|2007|p=294}} and singer Red E. Lewis, he was asked by singer [[Neil Christian]] to join his band, The Crusaders, after Christian had seen a fifteen-year-old Page playing in a local hall.<ref name = Schulps /> Page toured with Christian for approximately two years and later played on several of his records, including the 1962 single, \"The Road to Love.\"\n\nDuring his stint with Christian, Page fell seriously ill with [[Infectious mononucleosis|glandular fever]] (infectious mononucleosis) and could not continue touring.<ref name = Schulps /> While recovering, he decided to put his musical career on hold and concentrate on his other love, painting, and enrolled at Sutton Art College in Surrey.<ref name = \"allmusicpage\" /> As he explained in 1975:\n\n{{quote|[I was] travelling around all the time in a bus.  I did that for two years after I left school, to the point where I was starting to get really good bread. But I was getting ill. So I went back to art college. And that was a total change in direction. That's why I say it's possible to do. As dedicated as I was to playing the guitar, I knew doing it that way was doing me in forever. Every two months I had glandular fever. So for the next 18 months I was living on ten dollars a week and getting my strength up.  But I was still playing.<ref name = \"PP75\" />}}\n\n==Early 1960s: session musician==\nWhile still a student, Page often performed on stage at [[Marquee Club|The Marquee]] with bands such as [[Cyril Davies]]' [[All-Stars (band)|All Stars]], [[Alexis Korner]]'s [[Blues Incorporated]] and fellow guitarists [[Jeff Beck]] and [[Eric Clapton]]. He was spotted one night by John Gibb of Brian Howard & the Silhouettes, who asked him to help record some singles for [[Columbia Graphophone Company]], including \"The Worrying Kind\". [[Mike Leander]] of [[Decca Records]] first offered Page regular studio work. His first session for the label was the recording \"[[Diamonds (Jerry Lordan song)|Diamonds]]\" by [[Jet Harris]] and [[Tony Meehan]], which went to Number 1 on the singles chart in early 1963.<ref name = Schulps />\n\nAfter brief stints with [[Carter-Lewis and the Southerners]], [[Mike Hurst (producer)|Mike Hurst]] and the Method and Mickey Finn and the Blue Men, Page committed himself to full-time session work. As a session guitarist he was known as 'Lil' Jim Pea' to prevent confusion with the other noted English session guitarist [[Big Jim Sullivan]]. Page was mainly called into sessions as \"insurance\" in instances when a replacement or second guitarist was required by the recording artist. \"It was usually myself and a drummer\", he explained, \"though they never mention the drummer these days, just me&nbsp;... Anyone needing a guitarist either went to Big Jim [Sullivan] or myself.\"<ref name = Schulps /> He stated that \"In the initial stages they just said, play what you want, cos at that time I couldn't read music or anything.\"<ref name=DuNoyer>{{cite journal|last=Paul|first=Du Noyer|title=Who the hell does Jimmy Page think he is?|work=[[Q (magazine)|Q]] magazine|issue=August 1988|pages=5\u20137}}</ref>\n\nPage was the favoured session guitarist of record producer [[Shel Talmy]]. As a result, he secured session work on songs for [[the Who]] and [[the Kinks]].<ref name=tripleJ>{{cite web|last=Kingsmill|first=Richard|url=http://www.abc.net.au/triplej/music_specials/s1402502.htm|title=Led Zeppelin Triple J Music Specials|work=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]|accessdate=12 July 2000}}</ref> Page is credited with playing acoustic twelve string guitar on two tracks on the Kinks' [[The Kinks (album)|debut album]] \"I'm a Lover Not a Fighter\" and \"I've Been Driving on Bald Mountain\"<ref>Booklet of the [[The Kinks (album)|The Kinks]] Deluxe Edition Sanctuary Records 2011</ref> and possibly on the b-side \"I Gotta Move\".<ref>Booklet of the Kinks' Picture Book boxset Sanctuary Records 2008</ref> He played rhythm guitar on the sessions for the Who's first single \"[[I Can't Explain]]\"<ref name =DuNoyer/> (although [[Pete Townshend]] was reluctant to allow Page's contribution on the final recording, Page also played lead guitar on the B-side \"[[Bald Headed Woman]]\").<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thewho.com/index.php?module=discography&discography_item_id=90 |title=Official Discography |publisher=The Who|date=13 September 1971 |accessdate=14 January 2013}}</ref> Page's studio gigs in 1964 included [[Marianne Faithfull]]'s \"[[As Tears Go By (song)|As Tears Go By]]\", [[The Nashville Teens]]' \"[[Tobacco Road (song)|Tobacco Road]]\", [[The Rolling Stones]]' \"[[Heart of Stone (The Rolling Stones song)|Heart of Stone]]\" (released on ''[[Metamorphosis (Rolling Stones album)|Metamorphosis]]''), [[Van Morrison]] & [[Them (band)|Them]]'s \"[[Baby Please Don't Go]]\" and \"[[Here Comes the Night (Bert Berns song)|Here Comes the Night]]\", [[Dave Berry (musician)|Dave Berry's]] \"[[The Crying Game (song)|The Crying Game]]\" and \"My Baby Left Me\", [[Brenda Lee]]'s \"Is It True,\" and [[Petula Clark]]'s \"[[Downtown (Petula Clark song)|Downtown]]\".\n\nIn 1965 Page was hired by Stones manager [[Andrew Loog Oldham]] to act as house producer and [[A&R]] man for the newly formed [[Immediate Records]] label, which allowed him to play on and/or produce tracks by [[John Mayall]], [[Nico]], [[Chris Farlowe]], [[Twice as Much]] and Clapton. Page also formed a brief songwriting partnership with then romantic interest, [[Jackie DeShannon]]. He composed and recorded songs for the John Williams (not the classical guitarist [[John Williams]]) album ''The Maureeny Wishful Album'' with Big Jim Sullivan. Page worked as session musician on [[Donovan]] Leitch's ''[[Sunshine Superman (album)|Sunshine Superman]]'' (1966) and the [[Johnny Hallyday]] albums ''Jeune Homme'' (1968) and ''Je Suis N\u00e9 Dans La Rue'' (1969), the [[Al Stewart]] album ''[[Love Chronicles]]'' (1969) and played guitar on five tracks of [[Joe Cocker]]'s debut album, ''[[With a Little Help from My Friends (Joe Cocker album)|With a Little Help from My Friends]]''. Over the years since 1970 Page played lead guitar on 10 [[Roy Harper]] tracks, comprising 81 minutes of music.\n\nWhen questioned about which songs he played on, especially ones where there exists some controversy as to what his exact role was, Page often points out that it is hard to remember exactly what he did given the enormous number of sessions he was playing at the time.<ref name =DuNoyer/><ref name=tripleJ /> In a radio interview he explained that \"I was doing three sessions a day, fifteen sessions a week. Sometimes I would be playing with a group, sometimes I could be doing film music, it could be a folk session&nbsp;... I was able to fit all these different roles.\"<ref name=\"NPRPage\"/>\n\nAlthough Page recorded with many notable musicians, a lot of these early tracks are only available as [[bootleg recording]]s, several of which were released by the Led Zeppelin fan club in the late 1970s. One of the rarest of these is the early jam session featuring Jimmy Page and Stones guitarist [[Keith Richards]] covering [[Robert Johnson (musician)|Robert Johnson]]'s \"Little Queen of Spades\". Several early tracks with Page were compiled on the twin album release, ''[[Jimmy Page: Session Man]]''. Page also recorded with Richards on guitar and vocals in Olympic Sound Studios on 15 October 1974. Along with Ric Grech on bass and Bruce Rowland on drums, a track called \"Scarlet\" was cut. Page reflected later in an interview with Rolling Stone's Cameron Crowe: \"I did what could possibly be the next Stones B side. It was Ric Grech, Keith and me doing a number called \"Scarlet.\" I can't remember the drummer. It sounded very similar in style and mood to those Blonde on Blonde tracks. It was great, really good. We stayed up all night and went down to Island Studios where Keith put some reggae guitars over one section. I just put some solos on it, but it was eight in the morning of the next day before I did that. He took the tapes to Switzerland and someone found out about them. Keith told people that it was a track from my album\".\n\nPage left studio work when the increasing influence of [[Stax Records]] on popular music led to the greater incorporation of brass and orchestral arrangements into recordings at the expense of guitars.<ref name=\"JPinterview\" /> He stated that his time as a session player served as extremely good schooling:\n{{quote|My session work was invaluable. At one point I was playing at least three sessions a day, six days a week! And I rarely ever knew in advance what I was going to be playing. But I learned things even on my worst sessions \u2013 and believe me, I played on some horrendous things. I finally called it quits after I started getting calls to do [[Elevator music|Muzak]]. I decided I couldn't live that life any more; it was getting too silly. I guess it was destiny that a week after I quit doing sessions Paul Samwell-Smith left the Yardbirds and I was able to take his place. But being a session musician was good fun in the beginning \u2013 the studio discipline was great. They'd just count the song off and you couldn't make any mistakes.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" />}}\n\n==Late 1960s: The Yardbirds==\n{{Main|The Yardbirds}}\n[[File:Yardbirds including Page.JPG|thumb|The Yardbirds, 1966. Clockwise from left: [[Jeff Beck]], Jimmy Page, [[Keith Relf]], [[Jim McCarty]] and [[Chris Dreja]].]]\n\nIn late 1964, Page was approached about the possibility of replacing Eric Clapton in the Yardbirds, but he declined out of loyalty to his friend.<ref name = Schulps /> In February 1965 Clapton quit the Yardbirds and Page was formally offered his spot, but because he was unwilling to give up his lucrative career as a session musician and because he was still worried about his health under touring conditions, he suggested his friend, Jeff Beck.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.ainian.com/HitParader_April66.pdf|journal=[[Hit Parader]]|issue=April 1966|title=Jeff Beck Interview (PDF)|accessdate=12 January 2013}}</ref> On 16 May 1966, drummer [[Keith Moon]], bass player [[John Paul Jones (musician)|John Paul Jones]], keyboardist [[Nicky Hopkins]], Jeff Beck and Page recorded \"[[Beck's Bolero]]\" in London's [[IBC Studios]]. The experience gave Page an idea to form a new [[Supergroup (music)|supergroup]] featuring Beck, along with [[The Who]]'s [[John Entwistle]] on bass and [[Keith Moon]] on drums.<ref name = Schulps /> However, the lack of a quality vocalist and contractual problems prevented the project from getting off the ground. During this time, Moon suggested the name \"Led [[Zeppelin]]\" for the first time, after Entwistle commented that the proceedings would take to the air like a lead balloon.\n\nWithin weeks, Page attended a Yardbirds concert at [[Oxford]]. After the show he went backstage where [[Paul Samwell-Smith]] announced that he was leaving the group.<ref name=\"JPinterview\" /> Page offered to replace Samwell-Smith, and this was accepted by the group. He initially played electric bass with the Yardbirds before finally switching to twin lead guitar with Beck when [[Chris Dreja]] moved to bass. The musical potential of the line-up was scuttled, however, by interpersonal conflicts caused by constant touring and a lack of commercial success, although they released one single, \"[[Happenings Ten Years Time Ago]]\". (While Page and Jeff Beck played together in the Yardbirds, the trio of Page, Beck and Clapton never played in the original group at the same time. The three guitarists did appear on stage together at the [[ARMS Charity Concert|ARMS charity concerts]] in 1983.)\n\nAfter Beck's departure, the Yardbirds remained a quartet. They recorded one album with Page on lead guitar, ''[[Little Games]]''. The album received indifferent reviews and was not a commercial success, peaking at only number 80 on the [[Billboard 200]].  Though their studio sound was fairly commercial at the time, the band's live performances were just the opposite, becoming heavier and more experimental. These concerts featured musical aspects that Page would later perfect with Led Zeppelin, most notably performances of \"[[Dazed and Confused (song)#Led Zeppelin live performances|Dazed and Confused]]\".\n\nAfter the departure of [[Keith Relf]] and [[Jim McCarty]] in 1968, Page reconfigured the group with a new line-up to fulfil unfinished tour dates in Scandinavia. As he said:\n\n{{quote|Once [the other Yardbirds] decided not to continue, then I was going to continue. And shift the whole thing up a notch&nbsp;... The whole thing was putting a group together and actually being able to play together. There were a lot of virtuoso musicians around at the time who didn't gel as a band. That was the key: to find a band that was going to fire on all cylinders.<ref name=\"Uncut09\">\"I first met Jimmy on Tolworth Broadway, holding a bag of exotic fish&nbsp;... \", ''[[Uncut magazine|Uncut]]'', January 2009, pp. 40\u201341.</ref>}}\n\nTo this end, Page recruited vocalist [[Robert Plant]] and drummer [[John Bonham]], and he was also contacted by [[John Paul Jones (musician)|John Paul Jones]], who asked to join.<ref name=Miserandino>Dominick A. Miserandino, [http://thecelebritycafe.com/interviews/john_paul_jones.html Led Zeppelin \u2013 John Paul Jones], TheCelebrityCafe.com.</ref> During the [[Led Zeppelin Scandinavian Tour 1968|Scandinavian tour]] the new group appeared as the New Yardbirds, but soon recalled the old joke by Keith Moon and John Entwistle. Page stuck with that name to use for his new band. Peter Grant changed it to \"Led Zeppelin\", to avoid a mispronunciation of ''\"Lead Zeppelin.\"''<ref name=\"Jimmy Page Online\">{{cite web|url=http://www.jimmypageonline.com/11318/42826.html |title=(unofficial website) |publisher=Jimmy Page Online |accessdate=11 September 2010}}</ref>\n\n==1968\u201380: Led Zeppelin==\n[[File:Jimmy Page early.jpg|thumb|180px|Jimmy Page onstage in 1973]]\n{{Main|Led Zeppelin}}\n\nLed Zeppelin are one of the best-selling music artists in the history of audio recording\u2014various sources estimate the group's sales at more than 200 or even 300 million albums worldwide. With 111.5 million RIAA-certified units they are the second-best-selling band in the United States. Each of their nine studio albums reached the top 10 of the US Billboard album chart, and six reached the number-one spot.\n\nLed Zeppelin were the progenitors of heavy metal and hard rock, and their sound was largely the product of Page's input as a producer and musician. The band's individualistic style drew from a wide variety of influences, including folk music. They performed on multiple record-breaking concert tours, which also earned them a reputation for excess. Although they remained commercially and critically successful, in the later 1970s, the band's output and touring schedule were limited by the personal difficulties of the members.\n\nPage explained that he had a very specific idea in mind as to what he wanted Led Zeppelin to be, from the very beginning:\n{{quote|I had a lot of ideas from my days with the Yardbirds. The Yardbirds allowed me to improvise a lot in live performance and I started building a textbook of ideas that I eventually used in Zeppelin. In addition to those ideas, I wanted to add acoustic textures. Ultimately, I wanted Zeppelin to be a marriage of blues, hard rock and acoustic music topped with heavy choruses \u2013 a combination that had never been done before. Lots of light and shade in the music.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" />}}\n\n==Post-Led Zeppelin career==\nLed Zeppelin broke up in 1980 following the death of drummer [[John Bonham]] at Page's home, The Old Mill House at [[Clewer]] in Berkshire. Page initially refused to touch a guitar, grieving for his friend.<ref name =DuNoyer/><ref name=uncutinterview>David Cavanagh, \"[http://www.uncut.co.uk/led-zeppelin/john-paul-jones-on-jimmy-page-interview]\", ''[[Uncut (magazine)|Uncut]]''.</ref> Thereafter, his work consisted of a series of short-term collaborations in the bands [[The Firm (rock band)|the Firm]], [[The Honeydrippers (Rock band)|the Honeydrippers]], reunions and individual work, including film soundtracks. He also became active in philanthropic work.\n\n===1980s===\n[[File:Jimmy Page 1983.jpg|thumb|upright|Page in 1983]]\n\nPage made a return to the stage at a [[Jeff Beck]] show in March 1981 at the [[Hammersmith Apollo|Hammersmith Odeon]].{{sfn|Case|2007|p=164}} Also in 1981, Page joined with [[Yes (band)|Yes]] bassist [[Chris Squire]] and drummer [[Alan White (Yes drummer)|Alan White]] to form a supergroup called [[XYZ (UK band)|XYZ]] (for ex-Yes-Zeppelin). They rehearsed several times, but the project was shelved. Bootlegs of these sessions revealed that some of the material emerged on later projects, notably The Firm's \"Fortune Hunter\" and Yes songs \"Mind Drive\" and \"Can You Imagine?\". Page joined Yes on stage in 1984 at [[Westfalenhalle]] in [[Dortmund]], Germany, playing \"[[I'm Down]]\".\n\nIn 1982 Page collaborated with director [[Michael Winner]] to record the ''[[Death Wish II (album)|Death Wish II]]'' soundtrack. This and several subsequent Page recordings, including the ''[[Death Wish III]]'' soundtrack (1985), were recorded and produced at his recording studio, [[Sol Studios|The Sol]] in [[Cookham]], which he had purchased from [[Gus Dudgeon]] in the early 1980s.\n\n[[File:Jimmy Page - A.R.M.S. Concert, Oakland, Ca. 1983.jpg|thumb|left|Page at an A.R.M.S. concert in 1983]]\n\nIn 1983 Page appeared with the A.R.M.S. (Action Research for [[Multiple sclerosis]]) charity series of concerts which honoured [[Small Faces]] bassist [[Ronnie Lane]], who suffered from the disease. For the first shows at the [[Royal Albert Hall]] in London, Page's set consisted of songs from the ''Death Wish II'' soundtrack (with [[Steve Winwood]] on vocals) and an instrumental version of \"Stairway to Heaven\". A four-city tour of the United States followed, with [[Paul Rodgers]] of [[Bad Company]] replacing Winwood. During the tour, Page and Rodgers performed \"Midnight Moonlight\" which would later appear on The Firm's first album. All of the shows featured an on stage jam of \"[[Layla]]\" that reunited Page with Yardbirds guitarists Beck and Clapton. According to the book ''[[Hammer of the Gods (book)|Hammer of the Gods]]'', it was reportedly around this time that Page told friends that he had just ended seven years of heroin use. On 13 December 1983, Page joined Plant on stage for one encore at the Hammersmith Odeon in London.\n\nPage next linked up with [[Roy Harper]] for the 1984 album ''[[Whatever Happened to Jugula?]]'' and occasional concerts, performing a predominantly acoustic set at folk festivals under various guises such as the MacGregors and Themselves. Also in 1984 Page recorded with Plant as the Honeydrippers the album ''[[The Honeydrippers: Volume 1]]'' and with [[John Paul Jones (musician)|John Paul Jones]] on the film soundtrack ''[[Scream for Help (album)|Scream for Help]]''.\n\nPage subsequently collaborated with Rodgers on two albums under the name [[The Firm (rock band)|The Firm]]. The first album, released in 1985, was the self-titled ''[[The Firm (album)|The Firm]]''. Popular songs included \"[[Radioactive (The Firm song)|Radioactive]]\" and \"Satisfaction Guaranteed\". The album peaked at number 17 on the ''Billboard'' pop albums chart and went gold in the US.  It was followed by ''[[Mean Business]]'' in 1986. The band toured in support of both albums, but soon split up.\n\nVarious other projects followed, such as session work for [[Graham Nash]], [[Stephen Stills]] and the Rolling Stones (on their 1986 single \"[[One Hit (to the Body)]]\").

I started to learn microphone placements and things like that, what did and what didn't work. I certainly knew what did and didn't work with drummers because they put drummers in these little sound booths that had no sound deflection at all and the drums would just sound awful. The reality of it is the drum is a musical instrument, it relies on having a bright room and a live room&nbsp;... And so bit by bit I was learning really how ''not'' to record.<ref name=\"NPRPage\"/></blockquote>\n\nHe developed a reputation for employing effects in new ways and trying out different methods of using microphones and amplification. During the late 1960s, most British music producers placed [[microphone]]s directly in front of [[amplifier]]s and drums, resulting in the sometimes \"tinny\" sound of the recordings of the era. Page commented to ''Guitar World'' magazine that he felt the drum sounds of the day in particular \"sounded like cardboard boxes.\"<ref name=\"guiwo\" /> Instead, Page was a fan of 1950s recording techniques, [[Sun Studios]] being a particular favourite. In the same ''Guitar World'' interview, Page remarked: \"Recording used to be a science\" and \"[engineers] used to have a maxim: distance equals depth.\" Taking this maxim to heart, Page developed the idea of placing an additional microphone some distance from the amplifier (as much as twenty feet) and then recording the balance between the two. By adopting this technique, Page became one of the first British producers to record a band's \"ambient sound\" \u2013 the distance of a note's time-lag from one end of the room to the other.<ref name = RS2006/>\n\nFor the recording of several Led Zeppelin tracks, such as \"[[Whole Lotta Love]]\" and \"[[You Shook Me]]\", Page additionally utilised \"[[reverse echo]]\" \u2013 a technique which he claims to have invented himself while with the Yardbirds (he had originally developed the method when recording the 1967 single \"[[Ten Little Indians (Harry Nilsson song)|Ten Little Indians]]\").<ref name=\"guiwo\"/> This production technique involved hearing the echo before the main sound instead of after it, achieved by turning the tape over and employing the echo on a spare track, then turning the tape back over again to get the echo preceding the signal.\n\nPage has stated that, as producer, he deliberately changed the [[audio engineer]]s on Led Zeppelin albums, from [[Glyn Johns]] for the first album, to [[Eddie Kramer]] for ''[[Led Zeppelin II]]'', to [[Andy Johns]] for ''[[Led Zeppelin III]]'' and later albums. He explained: \"I consciously kept changing engineers because I didn't want people to think that they were responsible for our sound. I wanted people to know it was me.\"<ref name=\"guiwo\" />\n\nJohn Paul Jones acknowledged that Page's production techniques were a key component of the success of Led Zeppelin:\n\n{{quote|The backwards echo stuff [and] a lot of the microphone techniques were just inspired. Using distance-miking&nbsp;... and small amplifiers. Everybody thinks we go in the studio with huge walls of amplifiers, but Page doesn't. He uses a really small amplifier and he just mikes it up really well, so that it fits into a sonic picture.<ref name=\"uncutinterview\"/>}}\n\nIn an interview that Page himself gave to ''Guitar World'' magazine in 1993, he remarked on his work as a producer:\n\n{{quote|Many people think of me as just a riff guitarist, but I think of myself in broader terms&nbsp;... As a record producer I would like to be remembered as someone who was able to sustain a band of unquestionable individual talent and push it to the forefront during its working career.

This house features in the Zeppelin film ''The Song Remains The Same'' where Jimmy is seen sitting on the lawn playing a [[hurdy gurdy]].\n\n===Recreational drug use===\nPage has acknowledged heavy [[recreational drug use]] throughout the 1970s. In an interview with ''[[Guitar World]]'' magazine in 2003, he stated: \"I can't speak for the [other members of the band], but for me drugs were an integral part of the whole thing, right from the beginning, right to the end.\"<ref>Tolinski, Brad. \"The Greatest Show on Earth, ''Guitar World'', July 2003; re-published in ''Guitar Legends Magazine'', Winter 2004, p. 72.</ref> After the band's 1973 [[Led Zeppelin North American Tour 1973|North American tour]], Page told [[Nick Kent]]: \"Oh, everyone went over the top a few times.

His onstage appearance was not the only obvious change; his addiction caused Page to become so inward and isolated it altered the dynamics between him and Plant considerably.{{sfn|Fast|2001|p=47}} During the recording sessions for ''[[In Through the Out Door]]'' in 1978, Page's diminished influence on the album (relative to bassist John Paul Jones) is partly attributed to his heroin addiction, which resulted in his absence from the studio for long periods of time.<ref>Aizelwood, John. \"Closing Time\", ''Q Magazine'' Special Led Zeppelin edition, 2003, p. 94.</ref>\n\nPage reportedly kicked his heroin habit in the early 1980s.{{sfn|Davis|1985|pp=316\u2013317}} In a 1988 interview with ''[[Musician (magazine)|Musician]]'' magazine, Page took offence when the interviewer noted that heroin had been associated with his name and insisted: \"Do I look as if I'm a smack addict? Well, I'm not. Thank you very much.\"<ref>Du Noyer, Paul. \"Who the hell does Jimmy Page think he is?\", ''[[Q (magazine)|Q]]'' magazine, August 1988, p. 6.</ref>\n\nIn an interview he gave to ''[[Q magazine]]'' in 2003, Page responded to a question as to whether he regrets getting so involved in heroin and [[cocaine]]:\n\n{{quote|I don't regret it at all because when I needed to be really focused, I was really focused.

Page's own so-called \"Zoso\" symbol originated in ''Ars Magica Arteficii'' (1557) by [[Gerolamo Cardano]], an old alchemical [[grimoire]], where it has been identified as a [[sigil (magic)|sigil]] consisting of zodiac signs. The sigil is reproduced in ''Dictionary of Occult, Hermetic and Alchemical Sigils'' by Fred Gettings.{{sfn|Gettings|1981|p=201}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.inthelight.co.nz/ledzep/zososymbol.htm|title=Jimmy Page's symbol|date=17 September 2009|accessdate=4 December 2009}}\n</ref>\n\nDuring tours and performances after the release of the fourth album, Page often had the \"Zoso\" symbol embroidered on his clothes, along with [[zodiac]] symbols. These were visible most notably on his \"Dragon Suit\", which included the signs for Capricorn, Scorpio and Cancer which are Page's Sun, Ascendant and Moon signs, respectively.\n\nThe artwork inside the album cover of ''Led Zeppelin IV'' is from a painting attributed to the artist Barrington Colby MOM, influenced by the traditional Rider/Waite Tarot card design for the card called \"The Hermit\". Very little is known about Colby and rumours have persisted down the years that Page himself is responsible for the painting.<ref name=\"GW2008\" /> Page transforms into this character during his fantasy sequence in Led Zeppelin's concert film ''The Song Remains the Same''.\n\nIn the early 1970s Page owned an occult bookshop and publishing house, The Equinox Booksellers and Publishers, in [[Kensington High Street]], London, eventually closing it as the increasing success of Led Zeppelin occupied his time. The company published a facsimile of English occultist's [[Aleister Crowley]]'s 1904 edition of ''[[The Goetia]]''.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} Page has maintained a strong interest in Crowley for many years. In 1978, he explained:\n\n{{quote|I feel Aleister Crowley is a misunderstood genius of the 20th century. It is because his whole thing was liberation of the person, of the entity and that restrictions would foul you up, lead to frustration which leads to violence, crime, mental breakdown, depending on what sort of makeup you have underneath. The further this age we're in now gets into technology and alienation, a lot of the points he's made seem to manifest themselves all down the line. ...I'm not saying it's a system for anybody to follow. I don't agree with everything but I find a lot of it relevant and it's those things that people attacked him on, so he was misunderstood....I'm not trying to interest anyone in Aleister Crowley any more than I am in Charles Dickens. All it was, was that at a particular time he was expounding a theory of self-liberation, which is something which is so important. He was like an eye to the world, into the forthcoming situation. My studies have been quite intensive, but I don't particularly want to go into it because it's a personal thing and isn't in relation to anything apart from the fact that I've employed his system in my own day to day life....The thing is to come to terms with one's free will, discover one's place and what one is, and from that you can go ahead and do it and not spend your whole life suppressed and frustrated. It's very basically coming to terms with yourself.<ref>''[[Sounds (magazine)|Sounds]]'', 13&nbsp;March1978.</ref>}}\n\nPage was commissioned to write the soundtrack music for the film ''[[Lucifer Rising (film)|Lucifer Rising]]'' by Crowley admirer and underground movie director [[Kenneth Anger]]. Page ultimately produced 23 minutes of music, which Anger felt was insufficient because the film ran for 28 minutes and Anger wanted the film to have a full soundtrack. Anger claimed Page took three years to deliver the music and the final product was only 23 minutes of \"droning\". The director also slammed the guitarist in the press by calling him a \"dabbler\" in the occult and an addict and being too strung out on drugs to complete the project. Page countered that he had fulfilled all his obligations, even going so far as to lend Anger his own film editing equipment to help him finish the project.<ref name=\"GW2006\">''The Story Behind The Lost Lucifer Rising Soundtrack'', ''[[Guitar World]]'', October 2006.</ref> Page released the Lucifer Rising music on vinyl in 2012 via his website on \"Lucifer Rising and other sound tracks\". Side one contained \"Lucifer Rising - Main Track\", whilst side two contained the tracks \"Incubus\", \"Damask\", \"Unharmonics\", \"Damask - Ambient\", and \"Lucifer Rising  - Percussive Return\". In the December 2012 Rolling Stone cover story \"Jimmy Page Looks Back\", Page said: \"...there was a request, suggesting that Lucifer Rising should come out again with my music on. I ignored it.\"\n\nAlthough Page collected works by Crowley, he has never described himself as a [[Thelemite]] nor was he ever initiated into the [[Typhonian Order|O.T.O.]] The Equinox Bookstore and Boleskine House were both sold off during the 1980s, as Page settled into family life and participated in charity work.\n\nIn her 2001 autobiography ''Rebel Heart: An American Rock and Roll Journey'', [[Bebe Buell]], a one-time love interest of Page's, recounts his interest in the occult in depth as part of her portrait of him.\n\n==Discography==\n{{Main|Jimmy Page discography}}\n\n{{See also|Led Zeppelin discography}}\n\n;Studio albums\n* ''[[Whatever Happened to Jugula?]]'' (1985) <small>(with [[Roy Harper]])</small>\n* ''[[The Firm (album)|The Firm]]'' (1985) <small>(with [[The Firm (rock band)|The Firm]])</small>\n* ''[[Mean Business]]'' (1986) <small>(with The Firm)</small>\n* ''[[Outrider (album)|Outrider]]'' (1988)\n* ''[[Coverdale and Page (album)|Coverdale and Page]]'' (1993) <small>(with [[David Coverdale]])</small>\n* ''[[Walking into Clarksdale]]'' (1998) <small>(with Robert Plant)</small>\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin|2}}\n* {{cite book|last1=Bacon|first1=Tony|last2=Burrluck|first2=Dave|last3=Day|first3=Paul|last4=Wright|first4=Michael|year=2000|title=Electric Guitars: The Illustrated Encyclopedia|location=San Diego, CA|publisher=Thunder Bay Press|isbn=978-1-57145-281-8|ref=CITEREFBacon2000}}\n* {{cite book|last=Cole|first=Richard|authorlink=Richard Cole|year=1992|title=Stairway to Heaven: Led Zeppelin Uncensored|location=New York City|publisher=HarperCollins Publishers|isbn=978-0-06-018323-3|ref=CITEREFCole1992}}\n* {{cite book|last=Case|first=George|year=2007|title=Jimmy Page: Magus, Musician, Man: An Unauthorized Biography|edition=1st|location=New York City, NY|publisher=Hal Leonard|isbn=1-4234-0407-6|ref=CITEREFCase2007}}\n* {{cite book|last1=Chipkin|first1=Ken|last2=Stang|first2=Aaton|year=2003|title=Real Rock Guitar: A Classic Rock Bible of the '60s and '70s|location=Miami, FL|publisher=Warner Bros.
