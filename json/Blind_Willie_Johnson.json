While the lyrics of his songs were usually religious, his music drew from both sacred and blues traditions and is distinguished by his [[slide guitar]] accompaniment and gravelly [[Fauxbourdon|false-bass]] voice, with occasional use of a tenor voice.\n\n==Life==\nBlind Willie Johnson, according to his death certificate, was born in 1897 near [[Brenham, Texas]] (before the discovery of his death certificate, [[Temple, Texas]] had been suggested as his birthplace).<ref name=corcoran>{{cite web |author=Corcoran, Michael |title=The Soul of Blind Willie Johnson |url=http://www.austin360.com/news/entertainment/arts-theater/he-left-a-massive-imprint-on-the-blues-but-little-/nRzPM/ |accessdate=2012-11-08 }}</ref> When he was five, he told his father he wanted to be a preacher and then made himself a [[cigar box guitar]]. His mother died when he was young and his father remarried soon after her death.<ref name=charters>{{cite book| author=[[Samuel Charters|Charters, Samuel]]|year = 1993 |title= ''The Complete Blind Willie Johnson'' (CD booklet) |publisher= Columbia/Legacy C2K 52835}}</ref>\n\nJohnson was not born [[Blindness|blind]], and, although it is not known how he lost his sight, Angeline Johnson told [[Samuel Charters]] that when Willie was seven his father beat his stepmother after catching her going out with another man. According to this account, the stepmother then <!--(source used here implies spite as motive, not self-defense): in self-defense --> blinded young Willie by throwing [[lye]] in his face.<ref name=charters />\n\nIt is believed that Johnson married at least twice. He was married to Willie B. Harris. Her recollection of their initial meeting was recounted in the liner notes for [[Yazoo Records]]'s \"Praise God I'm Satisfied\" album. He was later alleged to have been married to a woman named Angeline. Johnson was also said to be married to a sister of blues artist, L.C. Robinson. {{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} No marriage certificates have yet been discovered.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} As Angeline Johnson often sang and performed with him,{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} the first person to attempt to research his biography, Samuel Charters, made the mistake of assuming it was Angeline who had sung on several of Johnson's records.<ref name=corcoran /> However, later research showed that it was Willie B. Harris.<ref name=corcoran />\n\nJohnson remained poor until the end of his life, preaching and singing in the streets of several Texas cities including [[Beaumont, Texas|Beaumont]]. A city directory shows that in 1945, a Rev. W.J. Johnson, undoubtedly Blind Willie, operated the House of Prayer at 1440 Forrest Street, Beaumont, Texas.<ref name=corcoran /> This is the same address listed on Johnson's death certificate. In 1945, his home burned to the ground. With nowhere else to go, Johnson lived in the burned ruins of his home, sleeping on a wet bed in the August/September Texas heat. He lived like this until he contracted [[malarial fever]] and died on September 18, 1945. (The death certificate reports the cause of death as malarial fever, with syphilis and blindness as contributing factors.)<ref name=corcoran /> In a later interview, his wife, Angeline said she tried to take him to a hospital but they refused to admit him because he was blind, while other sources report that his refusal was due to being black. And although there is some question as to where his exact grave location is, Blanchette Cemetery (which is the cemetery listed on the death certificate but location previously unknown) was officially located by two researchers in 2009. In 2010, those same researchers erected a monument to Johnson in the cemetery, but his exact gravesite remains unknown.<ref>{{cite book | author = Ford, Shane | year = 2011 | title = Shine a Light: My Year with \"Blind\" Willie Johnson |  isbn = 978-1-4583-7155-3 | publisher = lulu.com}}</ref>\n\n==Musical career==\n{{listen\n| filename=KeepYourLampTrimmedAndBurning.ogg\n| title=\"Keep Your Lamp Trimmed and Burning\"\n| description=The traditional blues song recorded in 1928 by Blind Willie Johnson and his first wife\n| format=[[Ogg]]}}\n\nHis father would often leave him on street corners to sing for money. Tradition has it that he was arrested for nearly starting a riot at a [[New Orleans]] courthouse with a powerful rendition of [[Samson and Delilah (song)|\"If I Had My Way I'd Tear The Building Down\"]], a song about [[Samson]] and [[Delilah]]. According to Samuel Charters, however, he was simply arrested while singing for tips in front of the Customs House by a police officer who misconstrued the title lyric and mistook it for incitement.<ref name=charters /> [[Timothy Beal]] argued that the officer did not, in fact, misconstrue the meaning of the song, but that \"the ancient story suddenly sounded dangerously contemporary\" to him.<ref>{{cite book | last = Beal | first = Timothy | title = The Rise and Fall of the Bible: The Unexpected History of an Accidental Book | publisher = Houghton Mifflin Harcourt | place = New York | year = 2011 | pages = 176\u2013178 | isbn = 978-0-15-101358-6}}</ref>\n\nJohnson made 30 commercial [[recording studio]] [[gramophone record|record]] sides in five separate sessions for [[Columbia Records]] from 1927\u20131930. On some of these recordings Johnson uses a fast rhythmic picking style, while on others he plays slide guitar. According to a reputed one-time acquaintance, [[Blind Willie McTell]] (1898\u20131959), Johnson played with a brass ring, although other sources cite him using a knife. However, in enlargement, the only known photograph of Johnson seems to show that there is an actual bottleneck on the little finger of his left hand.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.wirz.de/music/johbwfrm.htm | title = Blind Willie Johnson Discography | author = Stefan Wirz | accessdate = 24 August 2011}}</ref> While his other fingers are apparently fretting the strings, his little finger is extended straight\u2014which also suggests there is a slide on it as well.\n\n==Legacy==\nSeveral of Blind Willie Johnson's songs have been interpreted by other musicians, including \"[[Jesus Make Up My Dying Bed]]\", \"[[It's Nobody's Fault but Mine]]\", \"[[Dark Was the Night, Cold Was the Ground]]\", \"[[John the Revelator (song)|John the Revelator]]\", \"[[You'll Need Somebody on Your Bond]]\", \"[[Motherless Children]]\" and \"[[Soul of a Man (song)|Soul of a Man]]\".\n\n\"Dark Was the Night\" was also included on the [[Voyager Golden Record]], copies of which were mounted on both of the [[Voyager Project]] unmanned space probes.  [[Carl Sagan]], who was involved with the selection of the contents of the record, chose the song as he believed it properly encapsulated the essence of loneliness that mankind often faces. [[Voyager 1]] has left the solar system and entered interstellar space, which [[Voyager 2]] is expected to do around 2016.\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* {{cite book | author = Charters, Samuel | year = 1959 | title = The Country Blues | publisher = [[Jazz Book Club]] | place = United Kingdom}}  &mdash; Some facts in the book are at variance with those given in this article and may represent an earlier stage of research\n* {{cite book|author=D.
