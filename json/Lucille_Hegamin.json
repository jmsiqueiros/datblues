I think I can say without bragging that I made the \"[[St. Louis Blues (song)|St. Louis Blues]]\" popular in Chicago; this was one of my feature numbers.\"<ref>Stewart-Baxter 1970, p. 19.</ref>\n\nThe Hegamins moved to [[Los Angeles, California]] in 1918, then to [[New York City]] the following year.<ref name=\"Harrison230\">Harrison 1990, p. 230.</ref> Bill Hegamin led his wife's accompanying band, called the Blue Flame Syncopators; [[Jimmy Wade]] was a member of this ensemble.\n\nIn November 1920, Hegamin became the second African-American blues singer to record, after [[Mamie Smith]].<ref>Stewart-Baxter 1970, p. 16.</ref> Hegamin made a series of recordings for the [[Arto Records|Arto]] [[record label]] through 1922, and then a few sides for [[Paramount Records|Paramount]] in 1922. One of her biggest hits was \"Arkansas Blues\", recorded for Arto and soon released on no fewer than nine other labels, including [[Black Swan Records|Black Swan]].<ref name=\"Harrison230\" /> Lucille Hegamin subsequently played theatre dates but did not tour extensively.<ref name=\"Harrison230\" />\n\nOn January 20, 1922, she competed in a blues singing contest against [[Daisy Martin]], [[Alice Leslie Carter]] and [[Trixie Smith]] at the Fifteenth Infantry's First Band Concert and Dance in New York City. Hegamin placed second to Smith in the contest, which was held at the Manhattan Casino.<ref>Stewart-Baxter 1970, p. 23.</ref>\n\nFrom 1922 through late 1926 she recorded over forty sides for [[Cameo Records]]; from this association she was billed as \"The Cameo Girl\".<ref>Stewart-Baxter 1970, p. 25.</ref> After her marriage to Bill Hegamin ended in 1923, her most frequent accompanist was pianist J. Cyrill Fullerton.<ref>Harris 1994, p. 221; Harrison 1990, p.230.</ref>  In 1926, Hegamin recorded with [[Clarence Williams (musician)|Clarence Williams]]' band for the [[Columbia Records|Columbia]] label. She performed in Clarence Williams' Revue at the Lincoln Theater in New York, then in various revues in New York and [[Atlantic City, New Jersey]] through 1934. In 1929 she appeared on the [[radio]] show \"Negro Achievement Hour\" on WABC, New York.<ref name=\"Harris 1994, p. 221\">Harris 1994, p. 221.</ref> In 1932 she recorded two sides for [[Okeh Records]].\n\nAbout 1934 she retired from music as a profession, and worked as a [[nurse]]. She came out of retirement in 1961 to record four songs, accompanied by a band led by [[Willie \"The Lion\" Smith]],  on the album ''Songs We Taught Your Mother''<ref name=\"Gates260\" /> for the [[Bluesville Records]] label. In 1962 she recorded an album, ''Basket of Blues'' for the Spivey label. She performed at a Mamie Smith Benefit concert at the Celebrity Club in New York City in 1964.<ref name=\"Harris 1994, p. 221\"/>\n\nLucille Hegamin died in [[Harlem Hospital Center|Harlem Hospital]] in [[New York City|New York]] on March 1, 1970,<ref name=\"Dead\">[http://thedeadrockstarsclub.com/newentrees.html Thedeadrockstarsclub.com] - accessed July 2010.</ref>  and was interred in the [[Cemetery of the Evergreens]] in [[Brooklyn, New York]].<ref name=\"Harris 1994, p. 221\"/>\n\n==Style==\nLucille Hegamin's stylistic influences included [[Annette Hanshaw]] and [[Ruth Etting]].<ref>Harris 1994, p. 222.</ref> According to Derrick Stewart-Baxter, \"Lucille's clear, rich voice, with its perfect diction, and its jazz feeling, was well in the vaudeville tradition, and her repertoire was wide.\"<ref>Stewart-Baxter 1970, p. 18.</ref>  Like Mamie Smith, Hegamin sang [[classic female blues]] in a lighter, more pop-tune influenced style than the rougher rural-style blues singers such as [[Ma Rainey]] and [[Bessie Smith]] who became more popular a few years later.<ref name=\"Gates260\">Gates et al. 2009, p. 260.</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n*Gates, H.
