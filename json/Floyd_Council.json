He became a well-known practitioner of the [[Piedmont blues]] sound from that area, popular throughout the [[Southeastern United States|southeastern region]] of the [[United States|US]] in the 1930s.\n\nBorn in [[Chapel Hill, North Carolina|Chapel Hill]], [[North Carolina]], [[United States]], to Harrie and Lizzie Council, Floyd began his musical career on the streets of Chapel Hill in the 1920s, performing with two brothers, Leo and Thomas Strowd as \"The Chapel Hillbillies\". In the late 1920s and early 1930s he and [[Blind Boy Fuller]] busked in the Chapel Hill area.<ref>Harris 1994, p. 133.</ref> He recorded twice for ARC at sessions with  Fuller in the mid-thirties, all examples of the Piedmont style.\n\nCouncil suffered a [[stroke]] in the late 1960s which partially paralyzed his throat muscles and slowed his motor skills, but did not significantly damage his cognitive abilities.  Folklorist [[Peter B. Lowry]] attempted to record him one afternoon in 1970, but he never regained his singing or playing abilities. Accounts say that he remained \"quite sharp in mind\".\n\nCouncil died in 1976 of a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]], after moving to [[Sanford, North Carolina]]. He was buried at White Oak AME Zion Cemetery in Sanford.\n\n==The Floyd in Pink Floyd==\n[[Syd Barrett]], of [[England|English]] [[psychedelic rock]] band [[Pink Floyd]], came up with the band's name by juxtaposing the first names of Council and [[South Carolina]] bluesman [[Pink Anderson]]. He noticed the names in the liner notes of a 1962 [[Blind Boy Fuller]] LP (Philips BBL-7512). The text, written by [[Paul Oliver]], read: ''\"[[Curley Weaver]] and [[Fred McMullen]], (...) [[Pink Anderson]] or Floyd Council - these were a few amongst the many blues singers that were to be heard in the rolling hills of the [[Piedmont blues|Piedmont]], or meandering with the streams through the wooded valleys.\"''\n\n==Discography==\nNo [[Gramophone record|records]] are available which exclusively feature Council's work. However, the [[Compact disc|CD]], ''Carolina Blues'', features six songs which he recorded: \"I'm Grievin' and I'm Worryin'\", \"I Don't Want No Hungry Woman\", \"Lookin' For My Baby\", \"Poor and Ain't Got a Dime\", \"Runaway Man Blues\" and \"Working Man Blues\".\n\nAccording to a 1969 interview, Council stated he had recorded 27 songs over his career, seven of them backing [[Blind Boy Fuller]]. Fuller's series of ''Complete Recorded Works'' contain many songs in which Council played guitar.\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*[[Sheldon Harris (music historian)|Harris, Sheldon]] (1994).
