Armstrong was registered as \"Lewie\" for the [[United States Census, 1920|1920 U.S. Census]]. On various live records he's called \"Louie\" on stage, such as on the 1952 \"Can Anyone Explain?\" from the live album ''In Scandinavia vol.1''. It should also be noted that \"Lewie\" is the French pronunciation of \"Louis\" and is commonly used in Louisiana. However, when referring to himself in \"Hello Dolly!,\" he pronounces his name as \"Lewis\" (\"Hello, Dolly. This is Lewis, Dolly\"), pronouncing the 's'.</ref> (August 4, 1901&nbsp;\u2013 July 6, 1971),<ref>Armstrong said he was not sure exactly when he was born, but celebrated his birthday on July 4. He usually gave the year as 1900 when speaking in public (although he used 1901 on his Social Security and other papers filed with the government). Using [[Roman Catholic Church]] documents from when his grandmother took him to be baptized, New Orleans music researcher [[Tad Jones]] established Armstrong's actual date of birth as August 4, 1901. With various other collaborative evidence, this date is now accepted by Armstrong scholars. See also ''[[age fabrication]]'' Armstrong had no middle name, but a 1949 ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine profile gave him the middle name of Daniel. The census and baptismal records confirm he had no middle name.</ref> nicknamed '''Satchmo'''<ref>For \"satchel-mouth.\"</ref> or '''Pops''', was an American [[jazz]] trumpeter and singer from [[New Orleans]], [[Louisiana]].\n\nComing to prominence in the 1920s as an \"inventive\" [[trumpet]] and [[cornet]] player, Armstrong was a foundational influence in jazz, shifting the focus of the music from collective improvisation to solo performance. With his instantly recognizable gravelly voice, Armstrong was also an influential singer, demonstrating great dexterity as an improviser, bending the lyrics and melody of a song for expressive purposes. He was also skilled at [[scat singing]] (vocalizing using sounds and syllables instead of actual lyrics).\n\nRenowned for his charismatic stage presence and voice almost as much as for his trumpet-playing, Armstrong's influence extends well beyond jazz music, and by the end of his career in the 1960s, he was widely regarded as a profound influence on popular music in general. Armstrong was one of the first truly popular African-American entertainers to \"cross over\", whose skin color was secondary to his music in an America that was severely racially divided. He rarely publicly politicized his race, often to the dismay of fellow African-Americans, but took a well-publicized stand for [[desegregation]] during the [[Little Rock Nine|Little Rock Crisis]]. His artistry and personality allowed him socially acceptable access to the upper echelons of American society that were highly restricted for a black man.\n\n== Early life ==\n[[File:Adi Holzer Werksverzeichnis 899 Satchmo (Louis Armstrong).jpg|thumb|right|Handcolored [[:en:Etching|etching]] ''Louis Armstrong'' by [[:de:Adi Holzer|Adi Holzer]] 2002.]]\n\nArmstrong often stated that he was born on July 4, 1900,<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/time100/artists/profile/armstrong.html The TIME 100.

Although he died in 1971, it was not until the mid-1980s that his true birth date of August 4, 1901 was discovered by researcher [[Tad Jones]] through the examination of [[baptism|baptismal records]].<ref>[http://www.louisarmstronghouse.org/about/faq.htm#LA5 When is Louis Armstrong's birthday?] The Official Site of the Louis Armstrong House & Archives.</ref> Armstrong was born into a very poor family in [[New Orleans, Louisiana]], the grandson of slaves. He spent his youth in poverty, in a rough neighborhood of [[Uptown New Orleans]], known as \u201cBack of the Town\u201d, as his father, William Armstrong (1881\u20131922), abandoned the family when Louis was an infant and took up with another woman. His mother, Mary \"Mayann\" Albert (1886\u20131927), then left Louis and his younger sister Beatrice Armstrong Collins (1903\u20131987) in the care of his grandmother, Josephine Armstrong, and at times, his Uncle Isaac. At five, he moved back to live with his mother and her relatives, and saw his father only in parades.\n\nHe attended the Fisk School for Boys, where he likely had early exposure to music. He brought in some money as a paperboy and also by finding discarded food and selling it to restaurants, but it was not enough to keep his mother from [[prostitution]]. He hung out in dance halls close to home, where he observed everything from licentious dancing to the [[quadrille]]. For extra money he also hauled coal to [[Storyville, New Orleans|Storyville]], the famed red-light district, and listened to the bands playing in the brothels and dance halls, especially Pete Lala's where [[Joe \"King\" Oliver]] performed and other famous musicians would drop in to [[jam session|jam]].\n\nAfter dropping out of the Fisk School at age eleven, Armstrong joined a quartet of boys who sang in the streets for money. But he also started to get into trouble. Cornet player [[Bunk Johnson]] said he taught Armstrong (then 11) to play by ear at Dago Tony's [[Honky tonk|Tonk]] in New Orleans,<ref>''Current Biography 1944'', pp. 15\u201317.</ref> although in his later years Armstrong gave the credit to Oliver. Armstrong hardly looked back at his youth as the worst of times but instead drew inspiration from it, \u201cEvery time I close my eyes blowing that trumpet of mine\u2014I look right in the heart of good old New Orleans... It has given me something to live for.\u201d<ref>{{Cite book|first=Laurence |last=Bergreen |title= ''Louis Armstrong: An Extravagant Life'' |publisher=Broadway Books |location=New York |isbn=0-553-06768-0 |year=1997 |page=6}}</ref>\n\nHe also worked for a Lithuanian-[[Jewish]] [[immigrant]] family, the Karnofskys, who had a junk hauling business and gave him odd jobs.

Professor Peter Davis (who frequently appeared at the Home at the request of its administrator, Captain Joseph Jones)<ref>''Current Biography 1944'' p. 16.</ref> instilled discipline in and provided musical training to the otherwise self-taught Armstrong. Eventually, Davis made Armstrong the band leader. The Home band played around New Orleans and the thirteen-year-old Louis began to draw attention by his cornet playing, starting him on a musical career.<ref>Bergreen, 1997, p. 78.</ref> At fourteen he was released from the Home, living again with his father and new stepmother and then back with his mother and also back to the streets and their temptations. Armstrong got his first dance hall job at Henry Ponce\u2019s where [[Black Benny]] became his protector and guide. He hauled coal by day and played his cornet at night.\n\nHe played in the city's frequent [[brass band]] parades and listened to older musicians every chance he got, learning from [[Bunk Johnson]], [[Buddy Petit]], [[Kid Ory]], and above all, [[Joe \"King\" Oliver]], who acted as a [[mentor]] and [[father figure]] to the young musician. Later, he played in the brass bands and [[riverboat]]s of New Orleans, and began traveling with the well-regarded band of [[Fate Marable]], which toured on a [[steamboat]] up and down the [[Mississippi River]]. He described his time with Marable as, \"going to the [[University]],\" since it gave him a much wider experience working with written [[arrangement]]s.\n\nIn 1919, Joe Oliver decided to go north and resigned his position in [[Kid Ory]]'s band; Armstrong replaced him. He also became second trumpet for the Tuxedo Brass Band, a society band.<ref>Bergreen, 1997, p. 142.</ref>\n\n== Career ==\n[[File:VocalionMuggles.jpg|thumb|upright|\"[[Muggles (recording)|Muggles]]\"]]\n[[File:Louis Armstrong Skokiaan.jpg|thumb|upright|\"[[Skokiaan]]\"]]\n[[File:Mack The Knife Coronet.jpg|thumb|upright|\"[[Mack The Knife]]\"]]\n[[File:Heebie Jeebies.jpg|thumb|upright|\u201cHeebie Jeebies\u201d by [[Louis Armstrong and his Hot Five]]]]\n\nThrough all his riverboat experience Armstrong\u2019s musicianship began to mature and expand. At twenty, he could read music and he started to be featured in extended trumpet solos, one of the first jazzmen to do this, injecting his own personality and style into his solo turns. He had learned how to create a unique sound and also started using singing and patter in his performances.<ref>Bergreen, 1997, p. 170.</ref> In 1922, Armstrong joined the exodus to Chicago, where he had been invited by his mentor, Joe \"King\" Oliver, to join his Creole Jazz Band and where he could make a sufficient income so that he no longer needed to supplement his music with day labor jobs. It was a boom time in Chicago and though race relations were poor, the \u201cWindy City\u201d was teeming with jobs for black people, who were making good wages in factories and had plenty to spend on entertainment.\n\nOliver's band was the best and most influential hot jazz band in Chicago in the early 1920s, at a time when Chicago was the center of the jazz universe. Armstrong lived like a king in Chicago, in his own apartment with his own private bath (his first). Excited as he was to be in Chicago, he began his career-long pastime of writing nostalgic letters to friends in New Orleans. As Armstrong\u2019s reputation grew, he was challenged to \u201ccutting contests\u201d by hornmen trying to displace the new phenom, who could blow two hundred high C\u2019s in a row.<ref>Bergreen, 1997, p. 199.</ref> Armstrong made his first recordings on the [[Gennett Records|Gennett]] and [[Okeh Records|Okeh]] labels (jazz records were starting to boom across the country), including taking some solos and breaks, while playing second cornet in Oliver's band in 1923. At this time, he met [[Hoagy Carmichael]] (with whom he would collaborate later) who was introduced by friend [[Bix Beiderbecke]], who now had his own Chicago band.\n\nArmstrong enjoyed working with Oliver, but Louis' second wife, pianist [[Lil Hardin Armstrong]], urged him to seek more prominent billing and develop his newer style away from the influence of Oliver. Armstrong took the advice of his wife and left Oliver's band. For a year Armstrong played in [[Fletcher Henderson]]'s band in New York on many recordings. After playing in New York, Armstrong returned to Chicago, playing in large orchestras; there he created his most important early recordings.<ref>http://www.britannica.com</ref> Lil had her husband play classical music in church concerts to broaden his skill and improve his solo play and she prodded him into wearing more stylish attire to make him look sharp and to better offset his growing girth. Lil\u2019s influence eventually undermined Armstrong\u2019s relationship with his mentor, especially concerning his salary and additional moneys that Oliver held back from Armstrong and other band members. Armstrong and Oliver parted amicably in 1924. Shortly afterward, Armstrong received an invitation to go to New York City to play with the [[Fletcher Henderson]] Orchestra, the top African-American band of the day. Armstrong switched to the trumpet to blend in better with the other musicians in his section. His influence upon Henderson's [[tenor saxophone|tenor sax]] soloist, [[Coleman Hawkins]], can be judged by listening to the records made by the band during this period.\n[[File:Hatter Sam Taft with Louis Armstrong.jpg|left|thumb|Armstrong getting fitted for a hat, about 1955.]]\nArmstrong quickly adapted to the more tightly controlled style of Henderson, playing trumpet and even experimenting with the trombone and the other members quickly took up Armstrong\u2019s emotional, expressive pulse. Soon his act included singing and telling tales of New Orleans characters, especially preachers.<ref>Bergreen, 1997, p. 247.</ref> The Henderson Orchestra was playing in the best venues for white-only patrons, including the famed [[Roseland Ballroom]], featuring the classy arrangements of [[Don Redman]]. [[Duke Ellington]]\u2019s orchestra would go to Roseland to catch Armstrong\u2019s performances and young hornmen around town tried in vain to outplay him, splitting their lips in their attempts.\n\nDuring this time, Armstrong made many recordings on the side, arranged by an old friend from New Orleans, pianist [[Clarence Williams (musician)|Clarence Williams]]; these included small jazz band sides with the Williams Blue Five (some of the best pairing Armstrong with one of Armstrong's few rivals in fiery technique and ideas, [[Sidney Bechet]]) and a series of accompaniments with [[blues]] singers, including [[Bessie Smith]], [[Ma Rainey]], and [[Alberta Hunter]].\n\nArmstrong returned to Chicago in 1925 due mostly to the urging of his wife, who wanted to pump up Armstrong\u2019s career and income. He was content in New York but later would concede that she was right and that the Henderson Orchestra was limiting his artistic growth. In publicity, much to his chagrin, she billed him as \u201cthe World\u2019s Greatest Trumpet Player\u201d. At first, he was actually a member of the Lil Hardin Armstrong Band and working for his wife.<ref>Bergreen, 1997, p. 260.</ref> He began recording under his own name for Okeh with his famous [[Louis Armstrong and his Hot Five|Hot Five]] and [[Louis Armstrong and his Hot Seven|Hot Seven]] groups, producing hits such as \"[[Potato Head Blues]]\", \"[[Muggles (recording)|Muggles]]\", (a reference to [[cannabis (drug)|marijuana]], for which Armstrong had a lifelong fondness), and \"[[West End Blues]]\", the music of which set the standard and the agenda for jazz for many years to come.\n\nThe group included [[Kid Ory]] (trombone), [[Johnny Dodds]] (clarinet), [[Johnny St. Cyr]] (banjo), wife Lil on piano, and usually no drummer. Armstrong\u2019s bandleading style was easygoing, as St. Cyr noted, \"One felt so relaxed working with him, and he was very broad-minded . . . always did his best to feature each individual.\"<ref>Bergreen, 1997, p. 274.</ref> His recordings soon after with pianist [[Earl Hines|Earl \"Fatha\" Hines]] (most famously their 1928 ''Weatherbird'' duet) and Armstrong's trumpet introduction to \"West End Blues\" remain some of the most famous and influential improvisations in jazz history. Armstrong was now free to develop his personal style as he wished, which included a heavy dose of effervescent jive, such as \"whip that thing, Miss Lil\" and \"Mr. Johnny Dodds, Aw, do that clarinet, boy!\"<ref>Bergreen, 1997, p. 264.</ref>\n\nArmstrong also played with [[Erskine Tate]]\u2019s Little Symphony, actually a quintet, which played mostly at the Vendome Theatre. They furnished music for silent movies and live shows, including jazz versions of classical music, such as \"Madame Butterfly,\" which gave Armstrong experience with longer forms of music and with hosting before a large audience. He began to scat sing (improvised vocal jazz using non-sensical words) and was among the first to record it, on \"[[Heebie Jeebies (composition)|Heebie Jeebies]]\" in 1926. The recording was so popular that the group became the most famous jazz band in the United States, even though they had not performed live to any great extent. Young musicians across the country, black or white, were turned on by Armstrong\u2019s new type of jazz.<ref>Bergreen, 1997, p. 267.</ref>\n\n[[File:Satchmo Messuhallissa.jpg|thumb|With [[Jack Teagarden]] (left) and [[Barney Bigard]] (right), Armstrong plays the trumpet in [[Helsinki]], [[Finland]], October 1949]]\nAfter separating from Lil, Armstrong started to play at the [[Sunset Cafe|Sunset Caf\u00e9]] for [[Al Capone|Al Capone's]] associate [[Joe Glaser]] in the [[Carroll Dickerson]] Orchestra, with [[Earl Hines]] on piano, which was soon renamed ''Louis Armstrong and his Stompers'',<ref>{{cite book|last=Collier|first=James Lincoln |authorlink=James Lincoln Collier| title=Louis Armstrong | publisher=Pan Books | year=1985|isbn=0-330-28607-2|pages=160\u2013162}}</ref> though Hines was the music director and Glaser managed the orchestra. Hines and Armstrong became fast friends as well as successful collaborators.<ref>Nairn: ''Earl \"Fatha\" Hines'': [https://vimeo.com/58414566] - see External Links/Video clips below.</ref>\n\nArmstrong returned to New York, in 1929, where he played in the pit orchestra of the successful musical ''Hot Chocolate'', an all-black revue written by [[Andy Razaf]] and pianist/composer [[Fats Waller]]. He also made a cameo appearance as a vocalist, regularly stealing the show with his rendition of \"[[Ain't Misbehavin' (song)|Ain't Misbehavin']]\", his version of the song becoming his biggest selling record to date.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.redhotjazz.com/lao.html |title=Louis Armstrong & his Orchestra |publisher=Redhotjazz.com |date= |accessdate=August 17, 2009}}</ref>\n\nArmstrong started to work at [[Connie's Inn]] in Harlem, chief rival to the [[Cotton Club]], a venue for elaborately staged floor shows,<ref>Morgenstern, Dan. \u201cLouis Armstrong and the development & diffusion of Jazz\u201d, Louis Armstrong a Cultural Legacy, Marc H Miller e.d., Queens Museum of Art in association with University of Washington Press, 1994 pg110</ref> and a front for gangster [[Dutch Schultz]]. Armstrong also had considerable success with vocal recordings, including versions of famous songs composed by his old friend [[Hoagy Carmichael]]. His 1930s recordings took full advantage of the new RCA [[ribbon microphone]], introduced in 1931, which imparted a characteristic warmth to vocals and immediately became an intrinsic part of the '[[crooning]]' sound of artists like [[Bing Crosby]]. Armstrong's famous interpretation of Hoagy Carmichael's \"[[Stardust (song)|Stardust]]\" became one of the most successful versions of this song ever recorded, showcasing Armstrong's unique vocal sound and style and his innovative approach to singing songs that had already become standards.\n\nArmstrong's radical re-working of [[Sidney Arodin]] and Carmichael's \"[[Lazy River]]\" (recorded in 1931) encapsulated many features of his groundbreaking approach to melody and phrasing. The song begins with a brief trumpet solo, then the main melody is stated by sobbing horns, memorably punctuated by Armstrong's growling interjections at the end of each bar: \"Yeah! ...\"Uh-huh\" ...\"Sure\" ... \"Way down, way down.\" In the first verse, he ignores the notated melody entirely and sings as if playing a trumpet solo, pitching most of the first line on a single note and using strongly syncopated phrasing. In the second stanza he breaks into an almost fully improvised melody, which then evolves into a classic passage of Armstrong \"[[scat singing]]\".\n\n[[File:Louis Armstrong NYWTS 3.jpg|right|thumb| Louis Armstrong, head-and-shoulders portrait, facing front, looking at trumpet in 1953.]]\nAs with his trumpet playing, Armstrong's vocal innovations served as a foundation stone for the art of jazz vocal interpretation. The uniquely gritty coloration of his voice became a musical [[archetype]] that was much imitated and endlessly impersonated. His scat singing style was enriched by his matchless experience as a trumpet soloist. His resonant, velvety lower-register tone and bubbling cadences on sides such as \"Lazy River\" exerted a huge influence on younger white singers such as [[Bing Crosby]].\n\nThe Depression of the early Thirties was especially hard on the jazz scene. The Cotton Club closed in 1936 after a long downward spiral, and many musicians stopped playing altogether as club dates evaporated. Bix Beiderbecke died and Fletcher Henderson\u2019s band broke up. King Oliver made a few records but otherwise struggled. Sidney Bechet became a tailor and Kid Ory returned to New Orleans and raised chickens.<ref>Bergreen, 1997, p. 320.</ref>\n\nArmstrong moved to Los Angeles in 1930 to seek new opportunities. He played at the New Cotton Club in Los Angeles with [[Lionel Hampton]] on drums. The band drew the Hollywood crowd, which could still afford a lavish night life, while radio broadcasts from the club connected with younger audiences at home. Bing Crosby and many other celebrities were regulars at the club. In 1931, Armstrong appeared in his first movie, ''Ex-Flame''. Armstrong was convicted of marijuana possession but received a suspended sentence.<ref>Collier (1985), p221-2</ref> He returned to Chicago in late 1931 and played in bands more in the [[Guy Lombardo]] vein and he recorded more standards. When the mob insisted that he get out of town,{{why|date=December 2012}} Armstrong visited New Orleans, got a hero\u2019s welcome and saw old friends. He sponsored a local baseball team known as \u201cArmstrong\u2019s Secret Nine\u201d and got a cigar named after himself.<ref>Bergreen, 1997, p. 344.</ref> But soon he was on the road again and after a tour across the country shadowed by the mob, Armstrong decided to go to Europe to escape.\n\nAfter returning to the United States, he undertook several exhausting tours. His agent Johnny Collins\u2019 erratic behavior and his own spending ways left Armstrong short of cash. Breach of contract violations plagued him. Finally, he hired Joe Glaser as his new manager, a tough mob-connected wheeler-dealer, who began to straighten out his legal mess, his mob troubles, and his debts. Armstrong also began to experience problems with his fingers and lips, which were aggravated by his unorthodox playing style. As a result he branched out, developing his vocal style and making his first theatrical appearances. He appeared in movies again, including Crosby's 1936 hit ''[[Pennies from Heaven (1936 film)|Pennies from Heaven]]''. In 1937, Armstrong substituted for [[Rudy Vallee]] on the CBS radio network and became the first African American to host a sponsored, national broadcast.<ref>Bergreen, 1997, p. 385.</ref>\n\nAfter spending many years on the road, Armstrong settled permanently in [[Queens]], New York in 1943 in contentment with his fourth wife, Lucille. Although subject to the vicissitudes of [[Tin Pan Alley]] and the [[gangster]]-ridden music business, as well as anti-black prejudice, he continued to develop his playing. He recorded Hoagy Carmichael's [[Rockin' Chair (1929 song)|Rockin' Chair]] for [[Okeh Records]].\n\nDuring the subsequent thirty years, Armstrong played more than three hundred gigs a year. Bookings for big bands tapered off during the 1940s due to changes in public tastes: ballrooms closed, and there was competition from television and from other types of music becoming more popular than big band music. It became impossible under such circumstances to support and finance a 16-piece touring band.\n\n=== The All Stars ===\n[[File:Louis Armstrong2.jpg|thumb|upright|Louis Armstrong in 1953]]\nFollowing a highly successful small-group jazz concert at New York Town Hall on May 17, 1947, featuring Armstrong with trombonist/singer [[Jack Teagarden]], Armstrong's manager [[Joe Glaser]] dissolved the Armstrong big band on August 13, 1947 and established a six-piece small group featuring Armstrong with (initially) Teagarden, [[Earl Hines]] and other top swing and dixieland musicians, most of them ex-big band leaders. The new group was announced at the opening of [[Billy Berg's]] Supper Club.\n\nThis group was called Louis Armstrong and his All Stars and included at various times [[Earl Hines|Earl \"Fatha\" Hines]], [[Barney Bigard]], [[Edmond Hall]], [[Jack Teagarden]], [[Trummy Young]], [[Arvell Shaw]], [[Billy Kyle]], [[Marty Napoleon]], [[Sid Catlett|Big Sid Catlett]], [[Cozy Cole]], [[Tyree Glenn]], [[Barrett Deems]], [[Joe Darensbourg]] and the [[Filipino-American]] [[percussionist]], [[Danny Barcelona]]. During this period, Armstrong made many recordings and appeared in over thirty films. He was the first jazz musician to appear on the cover of ''[[Time Magazine]]'' on February 21, 1949.\n\nIn 1964, he recorded his biggest-selling record, \"[[Hello, Dolly! (song)|Hello, Dolly!]]\", a song by [[Jerry Herman]], originally sung by [[Carol Channing]]. Armstrong's cover of the song went to No.&nbsp;1 on the pop chart, making Armstrong (age 63) the oldest person to ever accomplish that feat. In the process, Armstrong dislodged [[The Beatles]] from the No.&nbsp;1 position they had occupied for 14 consecutive weeks with three different songs.<ref name=Hale>[http://www.jazzhouse.org/gone/lastpost2.php3?edit=1176392524 Hale, James (editor of Jazzhouse.org), ''Danny Barcelona (1929\u20132007)'', Drums, Armstrong All-Star, The Last Post, 2007]. Retrieved July 4, 2007.</ref>\n\nArmstrong kept up his busy tour schedule until a few years before his death in 1971. In his later years he would sometimes play some of his numerous [[concert|gigs]] by rote, but other times would enliven the most mundane gig with his vigorous playing, often to the astonishment of his band.

His second wife was instrumental in developing his career, but in the late 1920s Hardin and Louis grew apart.

His own biography vexes biographers and historians, because he had a habit of telling tales, particularly of his early childhood, when he was less scrutinized, and his embellishments of his history often lack consistency.\n\nHe was not only an entertainer. Armstrong was a leading personality of the day who was so beloved by America that gave even the greatest [[African American]] performers little access beyond their public celebrity, that he was able to live privately a life of access and privilege accorded to few other African Americans.\n\nHe tried to remain politically neutral, which gave him a large part of that access, but often alienated him from members of the black community who looked to him to use his prominence with white America to become more of an outspoken figure during the [[African-American Civil Rights Movement (1955\u20131968)|Civil Rights Era]] of U.S. history.\n\n=== Nicknames ===\n[[File:Armstrong-Alassio.jpg|thumb|right|Autograph of Armstrong on the muretto of [[Alassio]]]]\nThe nicknames '''Satchmo''' and '''Satch''' are short for '''Satchelmouth'''. Like many things in Armstrong's life, which was filled with colorful stories both real and imagined, many of his own telling, the nickname has many possible origins.\n\nThe most common tale that biographers tell is the story of Armstrong as a young boy dancing for pennies in the streets of New Orleans, who would scoop up the coins off of the streets and stick them into his mouth to avoid having the bigger children steal them from him. Someone dubbed him \"satchel mouth\" for his mouth acting as a [[satchel (bag)|satchel]]. Another tale is that because of his large mouth, he was nicknamed \"satchel mouth\" which became shortened to '''Satchmo'''.\n\nEarly on he was also known as '''Dipper''', short for '''Dippermouth''', a reference to the piece ''Dippermouth Blues''.<ref>Armstrong, 1954, pp. 27-28</ref> and something of a riff on his unusual [[embouchure]].\n\nThe nickname '''Pops''' came from Armstrong's own tendency to forget people's names and simply call them \"pops\" instead. The nickname was soon turned on Armstrong himself. It was used as the title of a 2010 biography of Armstrong by [[Terry Teachout]].\n\n[[File:Louis Armstrong Autograph.jpg|frame|Armstrong's autograph from the 1960s]]\n\n=== Armstrong and race ===\nArmstrong was largely accepted into [[White people|white]] society, both on stage and off, a privilege reserved for very few African-American public figures, and usually those of either exceptional talent and fair skin tone. As his fame grew, so did his access to the finer things in life usually denied to a black man, even a famous one. His renown was such that he dined in the best restaurants and stayed in hotels usually exclusively for whites.<ref>{{cite video|title=The Adventures of Young Indiana Jones, Vol. 3, Disk 7, Mystery of the Blues Special Features, Louis Armstrong: Ambassador of Jazz|publisher=Lucasfilm, Ltd.|medium=DVD|time=17:30}}</ref>\n\nIt was a power and privilege that he enjoyed, although he was very careful not to flaunt it with fellow performers of color, and privately, he shared what access that he could with friends and fellow musicians.\n\nThat still did not prevent members of the African-American community, particularly in the late 1950s to the early 1970s, from calling him an ''[[Uncle Tom]]'', a black-on-black racial epithet for someone who kowtowed to white society at the expense of their own racial identity.\n\nHe was criticized for accepting the title of \"King of [[Zulu Social Aid & Pleasure Club|The Zulus]]\" for [[New Orleans Mardi Gras|Mardi Gras]] in 1949. In the [[New Orleans]] African-American community it is an honored role as the head of leading black Carnival [[Krewe]], but bewildering or offensive to outsiders with their traditional costume of grass-skirts and [[blackface]] makeup satirizing southern white attitudes.\n\nSome musicians criticized Armstrong for playing in front of segregated audiences, and for not taking a strong enough stand in the [[American Civil Rights Movement (1955-1968)|civil rights movement]].<ref>Collier (1985), p. 317-320</ref>\n\n[[Billie Holiday]] countered, however, \"Of course Pops toms, but he toms from the heart.\"<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=WcLJ3aK-ZSkC&pg=PT698&dq=from+the+heart+%22pops+toms%22#v=onepage&q=from%20the%20heart%20%22pops%20toms%22&f=false |title=100 Most Influential People of All Times |publisher=Books.google.com |date= January 1, 2007|accessdate=October 2, 2011|isbn=978-1-60501-124-0}}</ref>\n\nThe few exceptions made it more effective when he did speak out. Armstrong's criticism of [[Dwight D. Eisenhower|President Eisenhower]], calling him \"two-faced\" and \"gutless\" because of his inaction during the [[Little Rock Nine|conflict]] over school [[desegregation]] in [[Little Rock, Arkansas]] in 1957 made national news.\n\nAs a protest, Armstrong canceled a planned tour of the [[Soviet Union]] on behalf of the [[State Department]] saying \"The way they're treating my people in the South, the government can go to hell\" and that he could not represent his government abroad when it was in conflict with its own people.<ref name=\"Louis Armstrong, Barring Soviet Tour, Denounces Eisenhower and Gov.

Louis Armstrong was, in fact, baptized as a Catholic at the Sacred Heart of Jesus Church in New Orleans,<ref name=Gabbard /> and he met popes [[Pius XII]] and [[Paul VI]], though there is no evidence that he considered himself Catholic. Armstrong seems to have been tolerant towards various religions, but also found humor in them.\n\n=== Personal habits ===\n\n==== Purging ====\nArmstrong was also greatly concerned with his health and bodily functions. He made frequent use of [[laxatives]] as a means of controlling his weight, a practice he advocated both to personal acquaintances and in the diet plans he published under the title ''Lose Weight the Satchmo Way''. Armstrong's laxative of preference in his younger days was [[Pluto Water]], but he then became an enthusiastic convert when he discovered the herbal remedy [[Swiss Kriss]]. He would extol its virtues to anyone who would listen and pass out packets to everyone he encountered, including members of the [[British Royal Family]]. (Armstrong also appeared in humorous, albeit risqu\u00e9, cards that he had printed to send out to friends; the cards bore a picture of him sitting on a toilet\u2014as viewed through a keyhole\u2014with the slogan ''\"Satch says, 'Leave it all behind ya!'\"'')<ref name=\"LeaveItAllBehindYa\">{{Cite news| first = Peter | last = Gilstrap | url = http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/1996-02-29/news/leave-it-all-behind-ya/ | title = Leave It All Behind Ya | publisher = Phoenix New Times |date = February 29, 1996 |accessdate = August 11, 2007 }}</ref> The cards have sometimes been incorrectly described as ads for [[Swiss Kriss]].<ref>Teachout, Terry (2009) ''Pops: A Life of Louis Armstrong'' pp. 293\u2013294.</ref>\n\nIn a live recording of \"[[Baby, It's Cold Outside]]\" with [[Velma Middleton]], he changes the lyric from \"Put another record on while I pour\" to \"Take some Swiss Kriss while I pour.\"<ref>Louis Armstrong, \"Christmas Through the Years,\" Laserlight 12744</ref>\n\n==== Love of food ====\nThe concern with his health and weight was balanced by his love of food, reflected in such songs as \"Cheesecake\", \"Cornet Chop Suey,\"<ref>Satchmo.net.

On the road, he wrote constantly, sharing favorite themes of his life with correspondents around the world. He avidly typed or wrote on whatever stationery was at hand, recording instant takes on music, sex, food, childhood memories, his heavy [[Medical marijuana|\"medicinal\" marijuana]] use\u2014and even his bowel movements, which he gleefully described.<ref>Bergreen, 1997, p. 4.</ref> He had a fondness for lewd jokes and dirty limericks as well.\n\n=== Social organizations ===\nLouis Armstrong was not, as is often claimed, a [[Freemason]]. Although he is usually listed as being a member of Montgomery Lodge No. 18 (Prince Hall) in New York, no such lodge has ever existed. Armstrong states in his autobiography, however, that he was a member of the [[Knights of Pythias]], which is not a Masonic group.<ref>{{Cite news\n| last =\n| first =\n| title = Non-masons \u2013 Louis Armstrong\n| work = Grand Lodge of British Columbia and Yukon\n| pages =\n| publisher =\n| date =\n| url = http://www.freemasonry.bcy.ca/biography/armstrong_l/armstrong_l.html\n| accessdate = September 3, 2010}}</ref>\n\n== Music ==\n\n=== Horn playing and early jazz ===\n[[File:Selmer Trumpet given by King George V to Louis Armstrong.jpg|thumb|right|Selmer trumpet, given as a gift by [[King George V]] of the United Kingdom to Louis Armstrong in 1933.]]\nIn his early years, Armstrong was best known for his virtuosity with the cornet and trumpet. The greatest trumpet playing of his early years can be heard on his [[Hot Five]] and [[Hot Seven]] records, as well as the [[Red Onion Jazz Babies]]. The improvisations he made on these records of New Orleans jazz standards and popular songs of the day are unsurpassed by later jazz performers. The older generation of New Orleans jazz musicians often referred to their improvisations as \"variating the melody.\" Armstrong's improvisations were daring and sophisticated for the time, while often subtle and melodic.\n\nHe often essentially re-composed pop-tunes he played, making them more interesting. Armstrong's playing is filled with joyous, inspired original melodies, creative leaps, and subtle relaxed or driving rhythms. The genius of these creative passages is matched by Armstrong's playing technique, honed by constant practice, which extended the range, tone and capabilities of the trumpet. In these records, Armstrong almost single-handedly created the role of the jazz soloist, taking what was essentially a collective folk music and turning it into an art form with tremendous possibilities for individual expression.\n\nArmstrong's work in the 1920s shows him playing at the outer limits of his abilities. The Hot Five records, especially, often have minor flubs and missed notes, which do little to detract from listening enjoyment since the energy of the spontaneous performance comes through. By the mid-1930s, Armstrong achieved a smooth assurance, knowing exactly what he could do and carrying out his ideas to perfection.\n\nHe was one of the first artists to use recordings of his performances to improve himself. Armstrong was an avid audiophile. He had a large collection of recordings, including reel-to-reel tapes, which he took on the road with him in a trunk during his later career. He enjoyed listening to his own recordings, and comparing his performances musically. In the den of his home, he had the latest audio equipment and would sometimes rehearse and record along with his older recordings or the radio.<ref>Michael Cogswell, ''Louis Armstrong: The Offstage Story of Satchmo'' (Collector's Press, [[Portland, Oregon]], 2003) ISBN 1-888054-81-6 pp. 66\u201368.</ref>\n\n=== Vocal popularity ===\nAs his music progressed and popularity grew, his singing also became very important. Armstrong was not the first to record [[scat singing]], but he was masterful at it and helped popularize it. He had a hit with his playing and scat singing on \"[[Heebie Jeebies (composition)|Heebie Jeebies]]\" when, according to some legends, the sheet music fell on the floor and he simply started singing nonsense syllables. Armstrong stated in his memoirs that this actually occurred. He also sang out \"I done forgot the words\" in the middle of recording \"I'm A Ding Dong Daddy From Dumas.\"\n\nSuch records were hits and scat singing became a major part of his performances. Long before this, however, Armstrong was playing around with his vocals, shortening and lengthening phrases, interjecting improvisations, using his voice as creatively as his trumpet.\n\n=== Colleagues and followers ===\nDuring his long career he played and sang with some of the most important instrumentalists and vocalists of the time; among them were [[Bing Crosby]], [[Duke Ellington]], [[Fletcher Henderson]], [[Earl Hines]], the singing [[brakeman]] [[Jimmie Rodgers (country singer)|Jimmie Rodgers]], [[Bessie Smith]] and perhaps most famously [[Ella Fitzgerald]].\n\nHis influence upon Bing Crosby is particularly important with regard to the subsequent development of popular music: Crosby admired and copied Armstrong, as is evident on many of his early recordings, notably \"Just One More Chance\" (1931). The ''New Grove Dictionary of Jazz'' describes Crosby's debt to Armstrong in precise detail, although it does not acknowledge Armstrong by name:\n\n{{quote|Crosby... was important in introducing into the mainstream of popular singing an Afro-American concept of song as a lyrical extension of speech... His techniques\u2014easing the weight of the breath on the vocal cords, passing into a [[head voice]] at a low register, using forward production to aid distinct [[enunciation]], singing on consonants (a practice of black singers), and making discreet use of [[appoggiatura]]s, [[mordent]]s, and [[slur (music)|slur]]s to emphasize the text\u2014were emulated by nearly all later popular singers.}}\n\nArmstrong recorded two albums with Ella Fitzgerald: ''[[Ella and Louis]]'', and ''[[Ella and Louis Again]]'' for [[Verve Records]], with the sessions featuring the backing musicianship of the [[Oscar Peterson]] Trio and drummers [[Buddy Rich]] (on the first album), and [[Louie Bellson]] (on the second). [[Norman Granz]] then had the vision for Ella and Louis to record ''[[Porgy and Bess (Ella Fitzgerald and Louis Armstrong album)|Porgy and Bess]]'' which is the most famous and critically acclaimed version of the Gerswhin brothers' masterpiece.\n\nHis recordings for [[Columbia Records]], ''[[Louis Armstrong Plays W.C. Handy]]'' (1954) and ''Satch Plays Fats'' (all [[Fats Waller]] tunes) (1955) were both being considered masterpieces, as well as moderately well selling. In 1961 the All Stars participated in two albums - \"The Great Summit\" and \"The Great Reunion\" (now together as a single disc) with [[Duke Ellington]]. The albums feature many of Ellington's most famous compositions (as well as two exclusive cuts) with Duke sitting in on piano. His participation in [[Dave Brubeck]]'s high-concept jazz musical ''[[The Real Ambassadors]]'' (1963) was critically acclaimed, and features \"Summer Song,\" one of Armstrong's most hauntingly beautiful vocal efforts.\n[[File:Louis Armstrong NYWTS 4.jpg|thumb|Louis Armstrong in 1966]]\n\nIn 1964 his recording of the song \"Hello Dolly\" went to number one. An album of the same title was quickly created around the song, and also shot to number one (knocking [[The Beatles]] off the top of the chart). The album sold very well for the rest of the year, quickly going \"Gold\" (500,000). His performance of \"Hello Dolly\" won for best male pop vocal performance at the 1964 [[Grammy Awards]].\n\n1968 led to his final album, built around and named for the song [[What A Wonderful World]]. The song hit number one in the U.K. but failed to make an impact in the United States until the 1980s. It is now considered one of the greatest songs of all time, and by far the most popular song in the history of jazz music.\n\n=== Hits and later career ===\nArmstrong had many hit records including \"[[Stardust (song)|Stardust]]\", \"[[What a Wonderful World]]\", \"[[When The Saints Go Marching In]]\", \"[[Dream a Little Dream of Me (song)|Dream a Little Dream of Me]]\", \"[[Ain't Misbehavin' (song)|Ain't Misbehavin']]\", \"[[You Rascal You]]\", and \"[[Stompin' at the Savoy]]\". \"[[We Have All the Time in the World]]\" was featured on the soundtrack of the [[James Bond]] film ''[[On Her Majesty's Secret Service (film)|On Her Majesty's Secret Service]]'', and enjoyed renewed popularity in the UK in 1994 when it featured on a [[Guinness]] advert. It reached number 3 in the charts on being re-released.\n\nIn 1964, Armstrong knocked [[The Beatles]] off the top of the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart with \"[[Hello, Dolly! (song)|Hello, Dolly!]]\", which gave the 63-year-old performer a U.S. record as the oldest artist to have a number one song. His 1964 song \"Bout Time\" was later featured in the film ''[[Bewitched (2005 film)|Bewitched]]''.\n\nArmstrong performed in Italy at the 1968 [[Sanremo Music Festival]] where he sang \"Mi Va di Cantare\"<ref>\"Hit Parade Italia\" [http://www.hitparadeitalia.it/sanremo/edizioni/1968.htm Hit Parade Italia \u2013 Festival di Sanremo 1968].</ref> alongside his friend, the [[Eritrea]]n-born Italian singer [[Lara Saint Paul]].<ref>\"Mi va di cantare\" [http://www.lavocedelledonne.it/cantante.aspx?id_cantante=126 Lara Saint Paul \u2013 lavocedelledonne.it].</ref> In February 1968, he also appeared with Lara Saint Paul on the Italian [[RAI]] television channel where he performed \"Grassa e Bella,\" a track he sang in Italian for the Italian market and C.D.I. label.<ref>Louis Armstrong: \"''Grassa e bella''\" [http://michaelminn.net/armstrong/index.php?section8 Louis Armstrong Discography].</ref>\n\nIn 1968, Armstrong scored one last popular hit in the United Kingdom with \"[[What a Wonderful World]]\", which topped the British charts for a month; however, the single did not chart at all in America. The song gained greater currency in the popular consciousness when it was used in the 1987 movie ''[[Good Morning, Vietnam]]'', its subsequent re-release topping many charts around the world. Armstrong even appeared on the October 28, 1970, ''[[Johnny Cash]] Show'', where he sang [[Nat King Cole]]'s hit \"[[Rambling Rose (1962 song)|Rambling Rose]]\" and joined Cash to re-create his performance backing [[Jimmie Rodgers (country singer)|Jimmie Rodgers]] on \"[[Standing on the Corner (Blue Yodel No. 9)|Blue Yodel No.&nbsp;9]]\".\n\n=== Stylistic range ===\nArmstrong enjoyed many types of music, from blues to the arrangements of [[Guy Lombardo]], to Latin American folksongs, to classical symphonies and [[opera]]. Armstrong incorporated influences from all these sources into his performances, sometimes to the bewilderment of fans who wanted him to stay in convenient narrow categories. Armstrong was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] as an ''early influence''. Some of his solos from the 1950s, such as the [[rock and roll|hard rocking]] version of \"[[St. Louis Blues (song)|St. Louis Blues]]\" from the ''WC Handy'' album, show that the influence went in both directions.\n\n== Literature, radio, films and TV ==\nArmstrong appeared in more than a dozen Hollywood films, usually playing a band leader or musician. His most familiar role was as the bandleader ''cum'' narrator in the 1956 [[Musical film|musical]], ''[[High Society (1956 film)|High Society]]'', in which he sang the title song and performed a duet with [[Bing Crosby]] on \"[[Now You Has Jazz]]\". In 1947, he played himself in the movie ''[[New Orleans (1947 film)|New Orleans]]'' opposite [[Billie Holiday]], which chronicled the demise of the [[Storyville, New Orleans|Storyville]] district and the ensuing exodus of musicians from New Orleans to Chicago.<ref>[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0039655/ IMDb.com]</ref> In the 1959 film, [[The Five Pennies]] (the story of the cornetist [[Red Nichols]]), Armstrong played himself as well as singing and playing several classic numbers. With [[Danny Kaye]] Armstrong performed a duet of \"When the Saints Go Marching In\" during which Kaye impersonated Armstrong. Armstrong also had a part in the film alongside James Stewart in ''The Glenn Miller Story'' in which Glenn (played by Stewart) jammed with Armstrong and a few other noted musicians of the time.\n\nHe was the first African American to host a nationally broadcast radio show in the 1930s. In 1969, Armstrong had a cameo role in the film version of ''[[Hello, Dolly! (film)|Hello, Dolly!]]'' as the bandleader, Louis, to which he sang the title song with actress [[Barbra Streisand]]. His solo recording of \"[[Hello, Dolly! (song)|Hello, Dolly!]]\" is one of his most recognizable performances.\n[[File:Louis armstrong producers showcase 1956.JPG|thumb|Armstrong played a bandleader in the television production, \"The Lord Don't Play Favorites\", on ''[[Producers' Showcase]]'' in 1956.]]\nHe was heard on such radio programs as ''The Story of Swing'' (1937) and ''This Is Jazz'' (1947), and he also made countless television appearances, especially in the 1950s and 1960s, including appearances on ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]''.\n\nMany of Armstrong's recordings remain popular. Almost four decades since his death, a larger number of his recordings from all periods of his career are more widely available than at any time during his lifetime. His songs are broadcast and listened to every day throughout the world, and are honored in various movies, TV series, commercials, and even [[anime]] and [[video game]]s. \"[[A Kiss to Build a Dream On]]\" was included in the video game ''[[Fallout 2]]'', accompanying the intro cinematic. It was also used in the 1993 film ''[[Sleepless in Seattle]]'' and the 2005 film ''[[Lord of War]]''. His 1923 recordings, with Joe Oliver and his Creole Jazz Band, continue to be listened to as documents of ensemble style [[New Orleans jazz]], but more particularly as ripper{{Technical-statement|date=July 2011}} jazz records in their own right. All too often, however, Armstrong recorded with stiff, standard orchestras leaving only his sublime trumpet playing as of interest. \"Melancholy Blues,\" performed by Armstrong and his Hot Seven was included on the [[Voyager Golden Record]] sent into outer space to represent one of the greatest achievements of humanity. Most familiar to modern listeners is his ubiquitous rendition of \"[[What a Wonderful World]]\". In 2008, Armstrong's recording of [[Edith Piaf]]'s famous \"[[La Vie En Rose]]\" was used in a scene of the popular Disney/Pixar film ''[[WALL-E]]''. The song was also used in parts, especially the opening trumpets, in the [[French film]] ''[[Jeux d'enfants]]'' (''Love Me If You Dare''.)\n\n[[Argentina|Argentine]] writer [[Julio Cort\u00e1zar]], a self-described Armstrong admirer, asserted that a 1952 Louis Armstrong concert at the [[Th\u00e9\u00e2tre des Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es]] in Paris played a significant role in inspiring him to create the fictional creatures called [[Cronopio (literature)|Cronopios]] that are the subject of a number of Cort\u00e1zar's short stories. Cort\u00e1zar once called Armstrong himself \"Grand\u00edsimo Cronopio\" (The Great Cronopio).\n\nArmstrong appears as a minor fictionalized character in [[Harry Turtledove]]'s [[Southern Victory Series]]. When he and his band escape from a [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]]-like Confederacy, they enhance the insipid mainstream music of the North. A young Armstrong also appears as a minor fictionalized character in [[Patrick Neate]]'s 2001 novel ''[[Twelve Bar Blues (novel)|Twelve Bar Blues]]'', part of which is set in New Orleans, and which was a winner at [[2001 Whitbread Awards|that year's Whitbread Book Awards]].\n\nThere is a pivotal scene in ''[[Stardust Memories]]'' (1980) in which [[Woody Allen]] is overwhelmed by a recording of Armstrong's \"[[Stardust (song)|Stardust]]\" and experiences a nostalgic epiphany.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19800101/REVIEWS/1010330/1023 |title=Stardust Memories :: rogerebert.com :: Reviews |publisher=Rogerebert.suntimes.com |date=January 1, 1980 |accessdate=August 17, 2009}}</ref> The combination of the music and the perfect moment is the catalyst for much of the film's action, prompting the protagonist to fall in love with an ill-advised woman.<ref>[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0081554/ IMDb.com]</ref>\n\n== Awards and honors ==\n\n=== Grammy Awards ===\nArmstrong was posthumously awarded the [[Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award]] in 1972 by the Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences.

Yet, his irrepressible personality both as a performer, and as a public figure later in his career, was so strong that to some it sometimes overshadowed his contributions as a musician and singer.\n\nAs a virtuoso trumpet player, Armstrong had a unique tone and an extraordinary talent for melodic [[improvisation]]. Through his playing, the trumpet emerged as a solo instrument in jazz and is used widely today. He was a masterful accompanist and ensemble player in addition to his extraordinary skills as a soloist. With his innovations, he raised the bar musically for all who came after him.\n\nThough Armstrong is widely recognized as a pioneer of [[scat singing]], [[Ethel Waters]] precedes his scatting on record in the 1930s according to [[Gary Giddins]] and others.<ref>See ''Ken Burns' Jazz'' CD Set liner notes.</ref> Billie Holiday and Frank Sinatra are just two singers who were greatly indebted to him. Holiday said that she always wanted [[Bessie Smith]]'s 'big' sound and Armstrong's feeling in her singing. Even special musicians like Duke Ellington have praised Armstrong through strong testimonials. Duke Ellington said, \"If anybody was a master, it was Louis Armstrong.\" In 1950, [[Bing Crosby]], the most successful vocalist of the first half of the 20th century, said, \"He is the beginning and the end of music in America.\"\n\nOn August 4, 2001, the centennial of Armstrong's birth, New Orleans's airport was renamed [[Louis Armstrong International Airport]] in his honor.\n\nIn 2002, the [[Louis Armstrong and his Hot Five|Louis Armstrong's Hot Five and Hot Seven]] recordings (1925\u20131928) are preserved in the United States National Recording Registry, a registry of [[recording]]s selected yearly by the [[National Recording Preservation Board]] for preservation in the [[National Recording Registry]] of the [[Library of Congress]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.loc.gov/rr/record/nrpb/registry/nrpb-2002reg.html |title=Library of Congress archive |publisher=Loc.gov |date=February 18, 2009 |accessdate=August 17, 2009}}</ref>\n\nThe [[US Open (tennis)|US Open]] tennis tournament's former main stadium was named [[Louis Armstrong Stadium]] in honor of Armstrong who had lived a few blocks from the site.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usta.com/Active/News/National-Tennis-Center-News/National-Tennis-Center/14185_Ashe__Armstrong_Stadiums/ |title=Ashe & Armstrong Stadiums |publisher=Usta.com |date= May 25, 2008|accessdate=May 7, 2011}}</ref>\n\nToday, there are many bands worldwide dedicated to preserving and honoring the music and style of Satchmo, including the Louis Armstrong Society located in New Orleans, LA.\n\n=== House ===\nThe house where Louis Armstrong lived for close to 28 years was declared a [[National Historic Landmark]] in 1977 and is now a museum. The [[Louis Armstrong House|Louis Armstrong House Museum]], at 34-56 107th Street (between 34th and 37th Avenues) in Corona, Queens, presents concerts and educational programs, operates as a historic house museum and makes materials in its archives of writings, books, recordings and memorabilia available to the public for research. The museum is operated by the [[Queens College, New York|City University of New York's Queens College]], following the dictates of Lucille Armstrong's [[Will (law)|will]].\n\nThe museum opened to the public on October 15, 2003.
