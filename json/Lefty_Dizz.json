Unlike other left-handed players who re-strung the instrument to mirror the proper string order, Dizz played a right-handed guitar upside down, thereby reversing the order of the strings. After his discharge in 1956, he moved first to [[Detroit]] and then [[Chicago]] where he would settle permanently; there, he played under [[Lacy Gibson]] and [[Earl Hooker]]'s guidance.  He was proficient enough to join [[Sonny Thompson]]'s band in 1958.  He worked with Junior Cannady and [[John Lee Hooker]], but a major career move in 1964 saw Lefty Dizz become a member of [[Junior Wells]]' backing ensemble. They toured around the world together until 1971, when Lefty Dizz joined [[Hound Dog Taylor]] and the HouseRockers. Lefty Dizz remained in situ until Taylor's death in 1975, when he formed Shock Treatment. It was with this band that he further developed his own flamboyant approach, which incorporated raunchy jokes alongside his own skilful but showmanship style of guitar playing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=E2D1kNHag9wC&pg=PA50&dq=%22LEFTY+DIZZ%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=ZL1oT5CXC9Gd8gPSq_2RCQ&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=%22LEFTY%20DIZZ%22&f=false |title=The Chicago Music Scene:: 1960s and 1970s - Dean Milano - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-09-19}}</ref> His pleasant and joke-filled character was offset with sufficient intelligence to garner an economics degree at [[Southern Illinois University]].<ref name=\"AMG\"/>\n\nLefty Dizz performed at Chicago clubs such as the Kingston Mines, B.L.U.E.S. and the Checkerboard Lounge, as well as international touring.
