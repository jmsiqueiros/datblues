When he really gets going he's a three-ring circus. During one number, he plays, sings, whistles a chorus, and snaps his fingers with the technique of a Spanish dancer to give further percussive accompaniment to his blues. At times he turns sideways, almost with his back to the piano as he keeps pounding away at the keyboard and stomping his feet, meanwhile continuing to sing and shout at his audience or his drummer. Suddenly in the middle of a number he jumps up, his hands clasped in front of him, and walks around the piano stool, and then, unexpectedly, out booms a vocal break in a bass voice from somewhere. One second later, he has turned and is back at the keyboard, both hands flying at lightning- like pace. His actions and facial expressions are as intensely dramatic and exciting as his music.\"<ref name=colindavey>[http://www.colindavey.com/BoogieWoogie/articles/russell.htm \"Boogie Woogie\", reprinted courtesy of the late William Russell's estate]</ref>\n</blockquote>\n''\n\nWith his distinctive performance style, Lofton found himself a mainstay in his genre: His first [[sound recording and reproduction|recording]] was in April 1935  for [[Vocalion Records]] with guitar accompaniment from [[Big Bill Broonzy]].<ref name=\"Olderen 2817\">Olderen, Martin van, ''Clarence's Blues'', liner notes Oldie Blues OL 2817, 1979</ref> He later went on to own the ''Big Apple'' [[nightclub]] in Chicago and continued to record well into the late 1940s, when he retired.<ref name=allmusic/>\n\nLofton lived in Chicago until he died from a [[Thromboembolism|blood clot]] in his brain<ref name=allmusic/> in Cook County Hospital in 1957.<ref name=\"Olderen 2817\"/>\n\n==Influence==\nLofton was an integral part of the boogie-woogie genre in Chicago.<ref name=colindavey/> Some of his more popular songs include: \"Strut That Thing\", \"Monkey Man Blues\", \"I Don't Know\" and \"Pitchin' Boogie\". His talent was likened to that of [[Pinetop Smith]] and other prominent boogie-woogie artists including: [[Meade Lux Lewis]], [[Cow Cow Davenport]] and [[Jimmy Yancey]].
