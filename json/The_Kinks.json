Thomas Kitts writes, \"The influence of these parties on The Kinks ... is remarkable.

Their debut at a school dance was well received, which encouraged the group to play at local pubs and bars. The band went through a series of lead vocalists; the most notable was [[Rod Stewart]],<ref name=\"Hinman 8-9\">Hinman, Doug (2004). pp.&nbsp;8\u20139</ref> another student at William Grimshaw,<ref>Ewbank, Tim and Stafford Hildred.

Numerous explanations of the name's genesis have been offered. In [[Jon Savage]]'s analysis, \"[They] needed a gimmick, some edge to get them attention.

Keyboardist [[Ian Gibbons]] was recruited for the subsequent tour, and soon became a permanent member of the group. Despite the personnel changes, the popularity of the band's records and live shows continued to grow.\n\nBeginning in the late 1970s, bands such as [[the Jam]] (\"[[David Watts (song)|David Watts]]\"), [[the Pretenders]] (\"Stop Your Sobbing\", \"I Go to Sleep\") and [[the Knack]] (\"The Hard Way\") recorded covers of Kinks songs, which helped bring attention to the group's new releases.<ref name=\"AllMusic\"/><ref name=\"Hall Bio\"/> In 1978, [[Van Halen]] covered \"You Really Got Me\" for their debut single, a Top 40 U.S. hit (the band later covered \"[[Where Have All the Good Times Gone]]\", another early Kinks song).

Nine of their albums charted in the Top 40.<ref name=\"Disc\"/> In the UK, the group had seventeen Top 20 singles along with five Top 10 albums.<ref name=\"Rogan, Johnny 2004\"/> The [[RIAA]] has certified four of The Kinks' albums as [[gold record]]s. ''[[Greatest Hits!]]'', released in 1965, was certified gold for sales of $1,000,000 on 28 November 1968\u2014six days after the release of ''The Kinks Are The Village Green Preservation Society'', which failed to chart worldwide.<ref name=\"Hinman 121\">Hinman, Doug (2004). p. 121</ref> The group would not receive another gold record award until 1979's ''Low Budget''; the 1980 live album ''One For The Road'' followed soon after, and was certified gold on 8 December 1980. ''Give The People What They Want'', released in 1981, received its certification on 25 January 1982, for sales of 500,000 copies.<ref name=\"Hinman 256\">Hinman, Doug (2004). p. 256</ref> [[ASCAP]], the [[Performing rights|performing-rights]] group, presented The Kinks with an award for \"One of the Most Played Songs Of 1983\" for the hit single \"Come Dancing\".<ref name=\"Hinman 272\"/>\n\nThe group received the [[Ivor Novello Award]] for \"Outstanding Service to British Music\",<ref name=\"Hinman, Doug 2004. p. 303\"/> and in 1990 the original four members of The Kinks were inducted into the [[Rock & Roll Hall of Fame]].<ref name=\"Hall Bio\"/><ref name=\"Blender\"/> The Kinks were inducted into the UK Music Hall of Fame in November 2005.<ref name=\"UK Music Hall\"/>\n\n== Musical style ==\nThe Kinks initially stayed within the boundaries of genres such as [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]] and [[blues]], but soon began experimenting with louder rock and [[hard rock]] sounds\u2014due to their pioneering of the field, they have often been labelled as \"the original [[Punk rock|punks]]\".<ref name=\"Hinman p. 1\">Hinman, Doug (2004). p. 1</ref><ref name=\"Hall of Fame Rocks\">{{cite web |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/hall-of-fame-anniversary-rocks-on-with-second-all-star-night-20091030|title=Hall of Fame Anniversary Rocks on With Second All-Star Night |author=Ganz, Caryn |date=30 October 2009 |work=Rolling Stone |accessdate=8 February 2010}}</ref> Dave Davies became bored with the traditional \"clean\" guitar style of the period; in search of a louder, more biting sound, he famously split the speaker cone of his Elpico [[amplifier]] (nicknamed \"the little green amp\"): \"I started to get really frustrated [with the amp's sound], and I said, 'I know! I'll fix you!' I got a single-sided Gillette razorblade and cut ... [from the centre to the edge of the] [[Speaker cone|cone]] ... so it was all shredded but still on there, still intact. I played and I thought it was amazing.\"<ref name=\"Hunter, Dave\">{{Cite journal |last=Hunter |first=Dave |title=Voxes, Vees And Razorblades|work=The Guitar Magazine |date=January 1999}}</ref> The jagged sound of the amplifier was replicated in the studio; the Elpico was plugged into a larger [[Vox AC30]], and the resulting effect became a mainstay in The Kinks' early recordings\u2014most notably on \"You Really Got Me\" and \"All Day and All of the Night\".<ref name=\"AllMusic\"/>\n\nHowever, the group soon abandoned its R&B and hard rock leanings. From 1966 onwards,<ref name=\"AllMusic\"/> The Kinks came to be known for their adherence to traditions of English music and culture, during a period when many other British groups dismissed their heritage in favour of American blues, R&B and pop styles.<ref name=\"AllMusic\"/> Ray Davies recalled that at a distinct moment in 1965 he decided to break away from the American scene, and write more introspective and intelligent songs. \"I decided I was going to use words more, and say things. I wrote '[[Well Respected Man]]'. That was the first real word-oriented song I wrote. ... [I also] abandoned any attempt to Americanise my accent.\"<ref name=\"Hinman\">Hinman, Doug (2004). p. 61</ref> The Kinks' allegiance to English styles was strengthened by the ban placed on them by the [[American Federation of Musicians]]. The ban cut them off from the American record buying public, the world's largest musical market,<ref name=\"AllMusic\"/> forcing them to focus on Britain and mainland Europe. The Kinks expanded on their English sound throughout the remainder of the 1960s, fusing music hall and folk, and creating some of the most influential and important music of the period.<ref name=\"AllMusic\"/>\n\nBeginning with ''Everybody's In Show-biz'' (1972), Ray Davies began exploring theatrical concepts on the group's albums; these themes became manifest on the 1973 album ''Preservation Act 1'' and continued through ''Schoolboys In Disgrace'' (1976).<ref name=\"AllMusic\"/> The Kinks found little success with these conceptual works, and reverted to a traditional rock format throughout the remainder of the 1970s. ''Sleepwalker'' (1977), which heralded their return to commercial success, featured a mainstream, relatively slick production style that would become their norm.<ref name=\"Sleepwalker\"/> The band returned to hard rock for ''Low Budget'' (1979), and continued to record within the genre throughout the remainder of their career.<ref name=\"AllMusic\"/>\n\n== Documentation, unreleased material and out-takes ==\nThe recording histories of contemporary acts were well-documented but little survived from studio archives of the Kinks' 1960s recording history.<ref name=\"Hinman 4-5\">Hinman, Doug

companies like [[EMI]], [[Pye Records]], kept few of the Kinks' session tapes, [[wiping]] or recording over most acetates and out-takes\u2014by the mid-1980s.<ref name=\"Hinman 5\"/> From 1971 - and the move to RCA - both documentation and tapes were preserved because, at their own Konk Studios, The Kinks kept creative licence \u2013 but \"until and unless there is some access to the vaults of Konk Studios, this aspect of the Kinks' recording legacy will remain far from definitive\", Doug Hinman wrote in 2004.<ref name=\"Hinman 5\">Hinman, Doug (2004). p. 5</ref> Later compilation releases,
