While earlier Mughal buildings were primarily constructed of red [[sandstone]], Shah Jahan promoted the use of white marble inlaid with [[semi-precious stones]], and buildings under his patronage reached new levels of refinement.<ref>Copplestone, p. 166.</ref>\n[[File:TajMahal0.JPG|thumb|Taj Mahal seen from [[Agra Fort]]]]\n\n===Tomb===\n[[File:Taj Mahal-11.jpg|thumb|Northern view, from across the river [[Yamuna]]]]\n[[File:Taj Mahal by day 25th feb.png|thumb|Eastern panaromic view by day]]\n[[File:Taj Mahal East Side.JPG|thumb|Eastern view, early in the day]]\n[[File:Taj Mahal Sunset Edit1.jpg|thumb|Western viewed, late in the day]]\nThe tomb is the central focus of the entire complex of the Taj Mahal. This large, white marble structure stands on a square plinth and consists of a symmetrical building with an [[iwan]] (an arch-shaped doorway) topped by a large dome and finial. Like most Mughal tombs, the basic elements are Persian in origin.\n\nThe base structure is essentially a large, multi-chambered cube with [[chamfer]]ed corners, forming an unequal octagon that is approximately {{convert|55|m|ft}} on each of the four long sides. On each of these sides, a huge ''[[pishtaq]]'', or vaulted archway, frames the iwan with two similarly shaped, arched balconies stacked on either side. This motif of stacked pishtaqs is replicated on the chamfered corner areas, making the design completely symmetrical on all sides of the building. Four [[minaret]]s frame the tomb, one at each corner of the plinth facing the chamfered corners. The main chamber houses the false [[sarcophagi]] of Mumtaz Mahal and Shah Jahan; the actual graves are at a lower level.\n\nThe marble dome that surmounts the tomb is the most spectacular feature. Its height of around {{convert|35|m|ft}} is about the same as the length of the base, and is accentuated as it sits on a cylindrical \"drum\" which is roughly {{convert|7|m|ft|}} high. Because of its shape, the dome is often called an [[onion dome]] or ''amrud'' (guava dome). The top is decorated with a [[Nelumbo nucifera|lotus]] design, which also serves to accentuate its height. The shape of the dome is emphasised by four smaller domed ''[[chhatri|chattris]]'' (kiosks) placed at its corners, which replicate the onion shape of the main dome. Their columned bases open through the roof of the tomb and provide light to the interior. Tall decorative spires (''guldastas'') extend from edges of base walls, and provide visual emphasis to the height of the dome. The [[Nelumbo nucifera|lotus]] motif is repeated on both the chattris and guldastas. The dome and chattris are topped by a gilded [[finial]], which mixes traditional Persian and Hindustani decorative elements.\n\n[[File:El Taj Mahal-Agra India0023.JPG|thumb|View from [[Mosque]]]]\n\nThe main finial was originally made of gold but was replaced by a copy made of gilded [[bronze]] in the early 19th century. This feature provides a clear example of integration of traditional Persian and Hindu decorative elements. The finial is topped by a [[moon]], a typical Islamic motif whose horns point [[heaven]]ward. Because of its placement on the main spire, the horns of the moon and the finial point combine to create a trident shape, reminiscent of traditional Hindu symbols of [[Shiva]].<ref name=\"Tillitson, G.H.R. 1990\"/>\n\nThe minarets, which are each more than {{convert|40|m|ft}} tall, display the designer's penchant for symmetry. They were designed as working minarets\u2014a traditional element of mosques, used by the [[muezzin]] to call the Islamic faithful to prayer. Each minaret is effectively divided into three equal parts by two working balconies that ring the tower. At the top of the tower is a final balcony surmounted by a chattri that mirrors the design of those on the tomb. The chattris all share the same decorative elements of a lotus design topped by a gilded finial. The minarets were constructed slightly outside of the plinth so that, in the event of collapse, (a typical occurrence with many tall constructions of the period) the material from the towers would tend to fall away from the tomb.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:TajAndMinaret.jpg|Base, dome, and [[minaret]]\nFile:Taj Mahal finial-1.jpg|Finial\nFile:TajEntryArch.jpg|Main [[iwan]] and side pishtaqs\nFile:Taj floorplan.svg|Simplified diagram of the Taj Mahal floor plan\nFile:TajMinaret1.jpg|Minaret\nFile:Taj Mahal 8.jpg|Minaret\n</gallery>\n\n====Exterior decoration====\n[[File:Taj Mahal Calligraphy Example.jpg|thumb|right|[[Calligraphy]] on large pishtaq]]\n[[File:Taj Mahal has a new audience everyday!.JPG|thumb|right|Visitors entering at Taj Mahal]]\nThe exterior decorations of the Taj Mahal are among the finest in Mughal architecture. As the surface area changes the decorations are refined proportionally. The decorative elements were created by applying paint, [[stucco]], stone inlays, or carvings. In line with the Islamic prohibition against the use of anthropomorphic forms, the decorative elements can be grouped into either [[calligraphy]], abstract forms or vegetative motifs.\n\nThroughout the complex, [[Sura|passages]] from the [[Qur'an]] are used as decorative elements. Recent scholarship suggests that the passages were chosen by Amanat Khan.<ref>[http://www.tajmahal.org.uk/calligraphy.html Taj Mahal Calligraphy].</ref><ref name = \"k100\"/>\nThe texts refer to themes of judgment and include:\n{{Refbegin|2}}\nSurah 36&nbsp;\u2013 [[Ya Sin]]<br>\nSurah 39&nbsp;\u2013 [[Az-Zumar]] ''The Crowds''<br>\nSurah 48&nbsp;\u2013 [[Al-Fath]] ''Victory''<br>\nSurah 67&nbsp;\u2013 [[Al-Mulk]] ''Dominion''<br>\nSurah 77&nbsp;\u2013 [[Al-Mursalat]] ''Those Sent Forth''<br>\nSurah 81&nbsp;\u2013 [[At-Takwir]] ''The Folding Up''<br>\nSurah 82&nbsp;\u2013 [[Al-Infitar]] ''The Cleaving Asunder''<br>\nSurah 84&nbsp;\u2013 [[Al-Inshiqaq]] ''The Rending Asunder''<br>\nSurah 89&nbsp;\u2013 [[Al-Fajr (sura)|Al-Fajr]] ''Daybreak''<br>\nSurah 91&nbsp;\u2013 [[Ash-Shams]] ''The Sun''<br>\nSurah 93&nbsp;\u2013 [[Ad-Dhuha]] ''Morning Light''<br>\nSurah 94&nbsp;\u2013 [[Al-Inshirah]] ''The Solace''<br>\nSurah 95&nbsp;\u2013 [[At-Tin|At-Teen]] ''The Fig''<br>\nSurah 98&nbsp;\u2013 [[Al-Bayyina]]h ''The Evidence''<br>\nSurah 112&nbsp;\u2013 [[Al-Ikhlas]] ''The Purity of Faith''\n\n{{Refend}}\nThe calligraphy on the Great Gate reads ''\"O Soul, thou art at rest. Return to the Lord at peace with Him, and He at peace with you.\"''<ref name=\"k100\">Koch, p. 100.</ref>\n\nThe calligraphy was created by a calligrapher named Abd ul-Haq, in 1609. Shah Jahan conferred the title of \"Amanat Khan\" upon him as a reward for his \"dazzling virtuosity\".<ref name=\"IAAO\"/> Near the lines from the Qur'an at the base of the interior dome is the inscription, \"Written by the insignificant being, Amanat Khan Shirazi.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/treasuresoftheworld/taj_mahal/tlevel_2/t4visit_3calligraphy.html |title=Public Broadcasting Service |publisher=PBS |accessdate=2 February 2010}}</ref> Much of the calligraphy is composed of florid [[thuluth]] script, made of [[jasper]] or black marble,<ref name=\"IAAO\"/> inlaid in white marble panels. Higher panels are written in slightly larger script to reduce the skewing effect when viewed from below. The calligraphy found on the marble [[cenotaph]]s in the tomb is particularly detailed and delicate.\n\nAbstract forms are used throughout, especially in the plinth, minarets, gateway, mosque, jawab and, to a lesser extent, on the surfaces of the tomb. The domes and vaults of the sandstone buildings are worked with [[tracery]] of [[incised painting]] to create elaborate geometric forms. [[opus spicatum|Herringbone]] inlays define the space between many of the adjoining elements. White inlays are used in sandstone buildings, and dark or black inlays on the white marbles. Mortared areas of the marble buildings have been stained or painted in a contrasting colour, creating geometric patterns of considerable complexity. Floors and walkways use contrasting [[tile]]s or blocks in [[tessellation]] patterns.\n\nOn the lower walls of the tomb there are white marble [[dado (architecture)|dados]] that have been sculpted with realistic [[bas relief]] depictions of flowers and vines. The marble has been polished to emphasise the exquisite detailing of the carvings and the dado frames and archway [[spandrel]]s have been decorated with [[pietra dura]] inlays of highly stylised, almost geometric vines, flowers and fruits. The inlay stones are of yellow marble, jasper and jade, polished and levelled to the surface of the walls.\n\n<center>\n<gallery>\nFile:TajGuldastaGeometricDeco.jpg|Herringbone\nFile:TajFlowerCloseUp.jpg|Plant motifs\nFile:TajSpandrel.jpg|Spandrel detail\nFile:TajPaintedGeometry.JPG|Incised painting\nFile:Taj Mahal reflective tiles in normal exposure.JPG|Reflective tiles normal exposure\nFile:Agra castle India persian poem.jpg|[[Persian calligraphy|Calligraphy]] of [[Persian language|Persian]] poems\nFile:TajFinialTiling.jpg|Finial Floor Tiling\nFile:Taj Mahal from Agra, April 2013.jpg|Marble Design Below the Iwans\n</gallery>\n</center>\n\n====Interior decoration====\n[[File:TajJoli1.jpg|thumb|right|Jali screen surrounding the cenotaphs]]\n[[File:TajCenotaphs3.jpg|thumb|right|Cenotaphs, interior of Taj Mahal in ground level]]\n[[File:Tombs-in-crypt.jpg|thumb|right|Tombs of Shah Jahan and Mumtaz Mahal at underground level]]\nThe interior chamber of the Taj Mahal steps far beyond traditional decorative elements. Here, the inlay work is not pietra dura, but a [[lapidary]] of precious and semiprecious [[gemstone]]s. The inner chamber is an octagon with the design allowing for entry from each face, although only the door facing the garden to the south is used.\n\nThe interior walls are about {{convert|25|m|ft|}} high and are topped by a \"false\" interior dome decorated with a sun motif. Eight pishtaq arches define the space at ground level and, as with the exterior, each lower pishtaq is crowned by a second pishtaq about midway up the wall. The four central upper arches form balconies or viewing areas, and each balcony's exterior window has an intricate screen or ''[[jali]]'' cut from marble. In addition to the light from the balcony screens, light enters through roof openings covered by chattris at the corners. Each chamber wall has been highly decorated with dado bas-relief, intricate lapidary inlay and refined calligraphy panels, reflecting in miniature detail the design elements seen throughout the exterior of the complex.\n\nThe octagonal marble screen or ''jali'' which borders the cenotaphs is made from eight marble panels which have been carved through with intricate pierce work. The remaining surfaces have been inlaid in extremely delicate detail with semi-precious stones forming twining vines, fruits and flowers.\n\nMuslim tradition forbids elaborate decoration of graves. Hence, the bodies of Mumtaz and Shah Jahan were put in a relatively plain crypt beneath the inner chamber with their faces turned right and towards [[Mecca]]. Mumtaz Mahal's [[cenotaph]] is placed at the precise centre of the inner chamber on a rectangular marble base of {{convert|1.5|by|2.5|m|ftin}}.\n\nBoth the base and [[casket]] are elaborately inlaid with precious and semiprecious gems. Calligraphic inscriptions on the casket identify and praise Mumtaz. On the lid of the casket is a raised rectangular lozenge meant to suggest a writing tablet. Shah Jahan's cenotaph is beside Mumtaz's to the western side, and is the only visible asymmetric element in the entire complex. His cenotaph is bigger than his wife's, but reflects the same elements: a larger casket on a slightly taller base, again decorated with astonishing precision with lapidary and calligraphy that identifies him. On the lid of this casket is a traditional sculpture of a small pen box.\n\nThe pen box and writing tablet were traditional Mughal funerary icons decorating the caskets of men and women respectively. [[Names of God in the Qur'an|The Ninety Nine Names of God]] are found as calligraphic inscriptions on the sides of the actual tomb of Mumtaz Mahal, in the crypt including ''\"O Noble, O Magnificent, O Majestic, O Unique, O Eternal, O Glorious... \"''. The tomb of Shah Jahan bears a calligraphic inscription that reads; \"He travelled from this world to the banquet-hall of Eternity on the night of the twenty-sixth of the month of [[Rajab]], in the year 1076 [[Islamic calendar|Hijri]].\"\n{{clear}}\n\n<center>\n<gallery>\nFile:CalligraphyTajMahal.JPG|Calligraphy on the walls of Taj Mahal\nFile:TajJaliArch.jpg|Arch of Jali\nFile:TajJaliPiercwork.jpg|Delicate pierce work\nFile:Jali-inlay.jpg|Detail of Jali\nFile:TajJaliInlay.jpg|Detail of [[Pietra dura]] jali inlay\n</gallery>\n</center>\n\n===Garden===\n[[File:Taj Mahal 5.jpg|thumb|right|Walkways beside reflecting pool]]\nThe complex is set around a large {{convert|300|m|ft|sing=on|}} square ''[[charbagh]]'' or [[Mughal gardens|Mughal garden]].\nThe garden uses raised pathways that divide each of the four quarters of the garden into 16 sunken [[parterre]]s or flowerbeds. A raised marble water tank at the center of the garden, halfway between the tomb and gateway with a [[reflecting pool]] on a north-south axis, reflects the image of the mausoleum. The raised marble water tank is called ''al Hawd al-Kawthar'', in reference to the \"Tank of Abundance\" promised to [[Muhammad]].<ref name = Begley>{{Cite journal\n | last = Begley\n | first = Wayne E.\n | title = The Myth of the Taj Mahal and a New Theory of Its Symbolic Meaning\n | journal=[[The Art Bulletin]]\n | volume = 61\n | issue = 1\n | page = 14\n |date=March 1979\n | doi = 10.2307/3049862}}\n</ref>\n\nElsewhere, the garden is laid out with avenues of trees and [[fountain]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.taj-mahal-travel-tours.com/garden-of-taj-mahal.html |title=taj-mahal-travel-tours.com |publisher=taj-mahal-travel-tours.com. |accessdate=2 February 2010}}</ref> The charbagh garden, a design inspired by [[Persian gardens]], was introduced to India by the first Mughal emperor, [[Babur]]. It symbolises the four flowing rivers of [[Jannah]] (Paradise) and reflects the [[Paradise garden]] derived from the Persian ''paridaeza'', meaning 'walled garden'. In [[Persian mysticism|mystic]] Islamic texts of Mughal period, Paradise is described as an ideal garden of abundance with four rivers flowing from a central spring or mountain, separating the garden into north, west, south and east.\n\nMost Mughal charbaghs are rectangular with a tomb or [[pavilion]] in the center. The Taj Mahal garden is unusual in that the main element, the tomb, is located at the end of the garden. With the discovery of [[Mahtab Bagh]] or \"Moonlight Garden\" on the other side of the Yamuna, the interpretation of the [[Archaeological Survey of India]] is that the Yamuna river itself was incorporated into the garden's design and was meant to be seen as one of the rivers of Paradise.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Wright|first=Karen|date=1 July 2000|title=Works in Progress|journal=[[Discover (magazine)|Discover]]|location=[[Waukesha, Wisconsin|Waukesha, WI, USA]]|publisher=[[Kalmbach Publishing]]|url=http://discovermagazine.com/2000/jul/featworks}}</ref> The similarity in layout of the garden and its architectural features with [[Shalimar Gardens (Jammu and Kashmir)|the Shalimar Gardens]] suggest that they may have been designed by the same architect, Ali Mardan.<ref>{{Cite book| last = Allan| first = John | title = The Cambridge Shorter History of India| publisher=S.

Outside the walls are several additional mausoleums, including those of Shah Jahan's other [[wives]], and a larger tomb for Mumtaz's favourite servant. These structures, composed primarily of red sandstone, are typical of the smaller Mughal tombs of the era. The garden-facing inner sides of the wall are fronted by columned [[arcade (architecture)|arcades]], a feature typical of Hindu temples which was later incorporated into Mughal mosques. The wall is interspersed with domed ''chattris'', and small buildings that may have been viewing areas or watch towers like the ''Music House'', which is now used as a museum.\n\n[[File:Taj Mahal Mosque Interior Hall.jpg|left|upright|thumb|Interior of the Taj Mahal mosque]]\nThe main gateway (''darwaza'') is a monumental structure built primarily of marble which is reminiscent of Mughal architecture of earlier emperors. Its archways mirror the shape of tomb's archways, and its ''pishtaq'' arches incorporate the calligraphy that decorates the tomb. It utilises bas-relief and pietra dura inlaid decorations with floral motifs. The vaulted ceilings and walls have elaborate geometric designs, like those found in the other sandstone buildings of the complex.\n\n[[File:Taj Mahal Mosque, Agra.jpg|thumb|right|Taj Mahal mosque.]]\nAt the far end of the complex, there are two grand red sandstone buildings that are open to the sides of the tomb. Their backs parallel the western and eastern walls, and the two buildings are precise mirror images of each other. The western building is a mosque and the other is the ''jawab'' (answer), whose primary purpose was architectural balance, although it may have been used as a guesthouse. The distinctions between these two buildings include the lack of ''[[mihrab]]'' (a niche in a mosque's wall facing Mecca) in the ''jawab'' and that the floors of ''jawab'' have a geometric design, while the mosque floor was laid with outlines of 569 prayer rugs in black marble. The mosque's basic design of a long hall surmounted by three domes is similar to others built by Shah Jahan, particularly to his ''Masjid-Jahan Numa'', or [[Jama Masjid, Delhi]]. The Mughal mosques of this period divide the [[sanctuary]] hall into three areas, with a main sanctuary and slightly smaller sanctuaries on either side.

Shah Jahan presented Maharajah Jai Singh with a large palace in the center of Agra in exchange for the land.<ref>Chaghtai ''Le Tadj Mahal'' p54; Lahawri ''Badshah Namah'' Vol.1 p. 403.</ref> An area of roughly three acres was excavated, filled with dirt to reduce seepage, and levelled at {{convert|50|m|ft}} above riverbank. In the tomb area, wells were dug and filled with stone and rubble to form the [[Foundation (engineering)|footings]] of the tomb. Instead of lashed [[bamboo]], workmen constructed a colossal brick scaffold that mirrored the tomb. The scaffold was so enormous that foremen estimated it would take years to dismantle.\n\nAccording to the legend, Shah Jahan decreed that anyone could keep the bricks taken from the scaffold, and thus it was dismantled by peasants overnight. A fifteen kilometre (9.3&nbsp;mi) tamped-earth ramp was built to transport marble and materials to the construction site and teams of twenty or thirty oxen pulled the blocks on specially constructed wagons.<ref name=\"CarrollDivision1973\">{{cite book\n|author1=David Carroll\n|author2=Newsweek, inc.

Water was drawn from the river by a series of ''purs'', an animal-powered rope and bucket mechanism, into a large storage tank and raised to a large distribution tank. It was passed into three subsidiary tanks, from which it was piped to the complex.\n\nThe plinth and tomb took roughly 12 years to complete. The remaining parts of the complex took an additional 10 years and were completed in order of minarets, mosque and jawab, and gateway. Since the complex was built in stages, discrepancies exist in completion dates due to differing opinions on \"completion\". For example, the mausoleum itself was essentially complete by 1643, but work continued on the rest of the complex. Estimates of the cost of construction vary due to difficulties in estimating costs across time. The total cost has been estimated to be about 32 million Rupees at that time.<ref name=\"Zahoor\">[http://www.islamicity.com/Culture/Taj/default.htm Dr. A. Zahoor and Dr. Z.

The translucent white marble was brought from [[Makrana]], Rajasthan, the jasper from [[Punjab region|Punjab]], [[jade]] and [[crystal]] from China. The [[turquoise]] was from [[Tibet]] and the [[Lapis lazuli]] from [[Afghanistan]], while the [[sapphire]] came from [[Sri Lanka]] and the [[carnelian]] from [[Arabia]]. In all, twenty eight types of precious and semi-precious stones were inlaid into the white marble.\n\nThe construction of the Taj Mahal was entrusted to a board of architects under imperial supervision, including Abd ul-Karim Ma'mur Khan, Makramat Khan, and [[Ustad Ahmad Lahauri]].<ref name=\"History of the Taj Mahal Agra\"/><ref name=\"IAAO\"/> Lahauri<ref name=\"From p88\"/> is generally considered to be the principal designer.<ref name=\"unesco\"/>\n\n[[File:Taj Mahal art.jpg|thumb|upright|Artist's impression of the Taj Mahal, from the [[Smithsonian Institution]]]]\nA labour force of twenty thousand workers was recruited across northern India.

Are they necessary?\nParticularly during the [[British Raj]], some commentators suggested that Taj Mahal was work of European artisans. As early as 1640, a Spanish friar who visited [[Agra]] wrote that Geronimo Veroneo, an Italian adventurer in Shah Jahan's court, was primarily responsible for the design. There is no reliable evidence to back up such assertions. [[Ernest Binfield Havel|E.B. Havell]], principal British scholar of Indian art in the later Raj, dismissed this theory as inconsistent, due to the methods employed by the designers. His conclusions were further supported by research of Muhammad Abdullah Chaghtai, who concluded that some of these theories may have been based on the misapprehension that \"[[Ustad Isa]]\", so often credited with the Taj's design, must have been a Christian because he bore the name \"Isa\" (Jesus), although this is, in fact, also a common Muslim name. Furthermore, there is no source earlier than 19th century which mentions an \"Ustad Isa\" in connection with the Taj Mahal. Chaghtai thought it more likely that the chief architect was [[Ustad Ahmad]], the designer of [[Shahjahanabad]], but admitted that this could not be conclusively proven from existing sources.<ref>Chaghtai ''Le Tadj Mahal'' pp. 69\u201394, 97, 147.</ref>\n\nA {{convert|0.25|m|in|sing=on|}} earthenware [[Pipe (material)|pipe]] placed about {{convert|1.5|m|ftin}} below the surface in line with the main walkway, filled the main pools of the complex. Additional copper pipes supplied water to the fountains in the north-south canal. Subsidiary channels were dug to [[irrigation|irrigate]] the entire garden. The fountain pipes were not connected directly to the feed pipes. Instead, a copper pot was provided under each fountain pipe, thus allowing equal pressure in each fountain. The purs no longer remain, but the other parts of the infrastructure have survived. --->\n\n==History==\n[[File:Tajfromriver1860.JPG|thumb|Taj Mahal by [[Samuel Bourne]], 1860.]]\n[[File:Taj From Red Fort of Agra.jpg|thumb|Taj Mahal as seen from Red Fort of Agra from where [[Shah Jahan]] used to see the mausoleum of his beloved wife during his last years]]\n\nAbdul Hamid Lahauri, the author of the [[Badshahnama]], the official history of Shah Jahan's reign, calls Taj Mahal ''[[rauza]]-i munawwara'', which means the illumined or illustrious tomb.<ref>{{cite book|last=Tillotson|first=Giles|title=Taj Mahal|year=2008|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, Mass.|isbn=9780674063655|page=14|url=http://books.google.co.in/books?id=YHEHNSTNnRQC&pg=PA14&dq=Rauza+meaning&hl=en&sa=X&ei=L8j3Up60LsKkrQfrmYGIAg&ved=0CCoQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=Rauza%20meaning&f=false|accessdate=9 February 2014}}</ref>\n\nSoon after the Taj Mahal's completion, Shah Jahan was deposed by his son [[Aurangzeb]] and put under house arrest at nearby [[Agra Fort]].

During the time of the [[Indian rebellion of 1857]], the Taj Mahal was defaced by British soldiers and government officials, who chiselled out precious stones and [[lapis lazuli]] from its walls. At the end of the 19th century, British [[viceroy]] [[George Nathaniel Curzon, 1st Marquess Curzon of Kedleston|Lord Curzon]] ordered a sweeping restoration project, which was completed in 1908.<ref>[http://www.taj-mahal.net/augEng/textMM/brasslampengN.htm Lord Curzon's Brass Lamp].</ref><ref>Yapp, Peter (1983).

It was suggested that Shah Jahan was overthrown by his son Aurangzeb before it could be built. Ruins of blackened marble across the river in ''Moonlight Garden'', Mahtab Bagh, seemed to support this legend. However, excavations carried out in the 1990s found that they were discolored white stones that had turned black.<ref name=\"k249\">Koch, p. 249.</ref> A more credible theory for the origins of the black mausoleum was demonstrated in 2006 by archaeologists who reconstructed part of the pool in the Moonlight Garden. A dark reflection of the white mausoleum could clearly be seen, befitting Shah Jahan's obsession with symmetry and the positioning of the pool itself.<ref>Warrior Empire: The Mughals of India (2006) A+E Television Network.</ref>\n\nNo evidence exists for claims that describe, often in horrific detail, the deaths, dismemberments and mutilations which Shah Jahan supposedly inflicted on various architects and craftsmen associated with the tomb.
