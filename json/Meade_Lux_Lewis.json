His best-known work, \"Honky Tonk Train Blues\", has been recorded by many artists.\n\n==Biography==\nLewis was born '''Meade Anderson Lewis''' in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]] in September 1905 (September 3, 4 and 13 have all been cited as his date of birth in various sources). In his [[adolescence|youth]] he was influenced by the pianist [[Jimmy Yancey]].<ref name=\"russell\">{{cite book|first=Tony|last=Russell|year=1997|title=The Blues - From [[Robert Johnson (musician)|Robert Johnson]] to [[Robert Cray]]| edition=|publisher=Carlton Books Limited|location=Dubai|page=135|isbn=1-85868-255-X}}</ref> His father, a guitarist who made two recordings of his own, introduced Meade to music and arranged for violin lessons.  He gave up the violin at age 16, shortly after his father's death, and switched to the piano.  The nickname \"Lux\" was given to him by his boyhood friends. He would imitate a couple of characters from a popular comic strip in Chicago, [[Alphonse and Gaston]], and stroke an imaginary beard as part of the routine.  His friends started calling him the [[Duke of Luxembourg]] because of this, and the name stuck for the rest of his life.  He became friends with [[Albert Ammons]] during childhood, a friendship that would last throughout their lives.  They went to the same school together briefly and they practiced and learned the piano together on the Ammons family piano. <ref>Silvester, Peter, A Left Hand Like God: A Study of Boogie-Woogie, p. 90-91</ref>\n\nA 1927 rendition of \"Honky Tonk Train Blues\" on the [[Paramount Records]] [[record label|label]] marked his recording debut.<ref name=\"russell\"/> He remade it for [[Parlophone]] in 1935 and for [[RCA Records|Victor]] in 1937 and a recording exists of a [[Camel Caravan]] broadcast, including \"Honky Tonk Train Blues\" from New York City in 1939. His performance at [[John H. Hammond|John Hammond]]'s historic ''[[From Spirituals to Swing]]'' concert at [[Carnegie Hall]] in 1938 brought Lewis to public attention.<ref name=\"AMG\"/> Following the event, Lewis and two other performers from that concert, [[Albert Ammons]] and [[Pete Johnson]], often appeared as a trio and became the leading boogie-woogie pianists of the day.<ref name=\"AMG\">{{cite web|first=|last=|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p98238/biography|pure_url=yes}}|title=Biography by Scott Yanow|publisher=Allmusic.com|accessdate=May 29, 2009}}</ref><ref name=\"russell\"/> \n\nThey performed an extended engagement at [[Caf\u00e9 Society]], toured as a trio, and inspired the formation of [[Blue Note Records]] in 1939. Their success led to a decade-long boogie-woogie craze,<ref>\"Deep Blues\" by Robert Palmer, 1981, p. 130</ref> with big band swing treatments by [[Tommy Dorsey]], Will Bradley, and others; and numerous country boogie and early [[rock and roll]] songs. \n\nLewis appeared in the movies ''[[New Orleans (film)|New Orleans]]'' (1947) and ''[[Nightmare (1956 film)|Nightmare]]'' (1956).<ref name=\"russell\"/> He also appeared, uncredited, in the movie ''[[It's a Wonderful Life]]'', playing piano in the scene where George Bailey gets thrown out of Nick's Bar.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0507540|title=Meade Lux Lewis on IMDb|accessdate=December 28, 2009}}</ref>\n\nLewis was quite fond of the Minneapolis area, where a niece lived, and would visit as often as he could.  He appeared annually at the White House Restaurant (no longer extant) in Golden Valley.  He began a successful three-week engagement there in May of '64.  Around two a.m. the morning of Sunday, June 7, leaving the parking lot of the White House and heading east on [[Olson Memorial Highway]], Lewis' Chrysler Imperial was rear-ended by one Ronald Bates, who was traveling an estimated 80 mph.  Lewis' car was pushed 400 feet, impacting a tree and killing him instantly. He was 58. Bates survived, but his passenger died the following day. <ref>Silvester, p. 225</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\nLewis' best-known work, \"Honky Tonk Train Blues\", has been recorded in various contexts, often in a [[big band]] arrangement.<ref name=\"russell\"/> Early recordings of the piece by artists other than Lewis include performances by [[Adrian Rollini]], [[Frankie Trumbauer]], classical harpsichordist [[Sylvia Marlowe]], theater organist [[George Wright (organist)|George Wright]] (with drummer [[Cozy Cole]], under the title \"Organ Boogie\"), and [[Bob Zurke]] with [[Bob Crosby]]'s orchestra. [[Keith Emerson]] of [[Emerson, Lake & Palmer]] often included it in his repertoire and recorded it in 1972.\n\nLewis was mentioned in Chapter 81 of author [[Kurt Vonnegut]]'s novel ''[[Cat's Cradle]]''. Lewis is also mentioned in [[Ross Macdonald]]'s novel ''[[The Moving Target]]'' and in [[Keith Richards]]'s autobiography ''[[Life (book)|Life]]''.\n\n==Discography==\n* 1975 - ''Tell Your Story'', [[Oldie Blues]], OL 2805<ref>[http://www.discogs.com/Meade-Lux-Lewis-Tell-Your-Story/release/3141337 ''Tell Your Story'' at Discogs]</ref>\n* 1982 - ''Giant of Blues and Boogie Woogie 1905-1964'', Oldie Blues, OL 2810<ref>[http://www.discogs.com/Meade-Lux-Lewis-Giant-Of-Blues-And-Boogie-Woogie-1905-1964-Vol-2/release/2569802 ''Giant of Blues and Boogie Woogie 1905-1964'' at Discogs]</ref>\n* 1984 - ''Chicago Piano Blues and Boogie Woogie 1936-1951 Vol. 3'', Oldie Blues, OL 2827<ref>[http://www.discogs.com/Meade-Lux-Lewis-Chicago-Piano-Blues-And-Boogie-Woogie-1936-1951-Vol-3/release/4561733 ''Chicago Piano Blues and Boogie Woogie 1936-1951 Vol. 3'' at Discogs]</ref>\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.aaregistry.org/historic_events/view/meade-lux-lewis-true-boogie-woogie-piano Meade Lux Lewis biography on African American Registry]\n* [http://www.discogs.com/artist/Meade+%22Lux%22+Lewis?anv=Meade+%27Lux%27+Lewis Meade 'Lux' Lewis discography at Discogs]\n* [http://rateyourmusic.com/artist/meade_lux_lewis Meade 'Lux' Lewis discography at Rate Your Music]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Authority control|VIAF=59270180}}\n{{Persondata\n| NAME              = Lewis, Meade Anderson\n| ALTERNATIVE NAMES = Lewis, Meade Lux\n| SHORT DESCRIPTION = [[United States|American]] boogie-woogie pianist and composer\n| DATE OF BIRTH     = September 1905\n| PLACE OF BIRTH    = [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]], [[United States]]\n| DATE OF DEATH     = June 7, 1964\n| PLACE OF DEATH    = [[Minneapolis, Minnesota]], United States\n}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Lewis, Meade Lux}}\n[[Category:1905 births]]\n[[Category:1964 deaths]]\n[[Category:American jazz pianists]]\n[[Category:American blues pianists]]\n[[Category:Boogie-woogie pianists]]\n[[Category:American jazz composers]]\n[[Category:People from Chicago, Illinois]]\n[[Category:Blue Note Records artists]]\n[[Category:Paramount Records artists]]\n[[Category:Parlophone artists]]\n[[Category:Victor Records artists]]"}]}}}}
