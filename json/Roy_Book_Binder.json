Gary Davis]], he is equally at home with blues and [[ragtime]], he is known to shift from [[open tunings]] to slide arrangements to original compositions, with both traditional and self-styled licks.  His storytelling emphasis is another characteristic that makes his style unique.\n\n==Life and career==\nBinder was born in [[Queens]], [[New York City|New York]], [[United States]].<ref name=\"AMG\"/> Upon graduation from high school, he joined the [[United States Navy|Navy]] and undertook a tour of duty in Europe.  He bought his first guitar at a military base in Italy.  After his enlistment was up, he returned to New York where he met his guitar hero, and became friends with [[Dave Van Ronk]].  Binder soon  sought out Davis who also lived in New York, and became first a student of Davis and later a chauffeur and tour companion.<ref name=\"AMG\"/>  Much of Binder's original material was based on his time on the road with Davis.\n\nBy the mid-to-late 1960s Binder was recording for both [[Kicking Mule]] and [[Blue Goose Records]].<ref name=\"AMG\"/> In 1969, he toured England with [[Arthur \"Big Boy\" Crudup]] and [[Homesick James]]. \n\nAfter meeting another of his life's influences,  the bluesman [[Pink Anderson]], Binder released his first album, ''Travelin' Man'', on Adelphi.<ref name=\"AMG\"/> The album was named after one of the songs that Binder learned from Anderson.\n\nIn 1973 he began a partnership with fiddler Fats Kaplin, and they recorded the ''Git Fiddle Shuffle'' in 1973.<ref name=\"AMG\"/> Binder and Kaplin performed together for three years, playing numerous concerts and recording a second album, ''Ragtime Millionaire'' in 1977. After this partnership dissolved, Binder began touring the country, living in a motor home, and concentrating on live performances.<ref name=\"AMG\"/>\n\nBinder has been described as a guitar pickin' hillbilly bluesman, and has released 12 albums. He has performed at most major blues and folk [[music festival|festivals]] in the U.S. and Europe, including [[Merlefest]]. Notables that have shared the stage with Binder include [[Bonnie Raitt]], [[B.B. King]], John Jackson, [[Sonny Terry]], [[Doc Watson]], [[Ray Charles]], and [[Brownie McGhee]]. Binder has appeared regularly on [[Nashville Now]], and has been included in [[Sheldon Harris (music historian)|Sheldon Harris]]' book, ''[[Blues Who's Who]]''. \n\nBinder is a veteran guitar instructor, and can often be found teaching at the Fur Peace Ranch with [[Jorma Kaukonen]] and others whose lives have been influenced by Davis.  There he demonstrates songs, turnarounds, chord variations, right hand methods, and many of his own powerful adaptations and unique approaches to the blues.\n\nBinder's album, ''Hillbilly Blues Cats'' (Rounder), was named as one of the ten most essential acoustic guitar albums of 1992.  The 1992 category winners also included [[Eric Clapton]]'s ''[[Unplugged (Eric Clapton album)|Unplugged]]'', [[Lyle Lovett]]'s ''Joshua Judges Ruth'' and [[Neil Young]]'s ''[[Harvest Moon (album)|Harvest Moon]]''.\n\n==Albums==\n*''Travelin' Man'' (1971)\n*''Git Fiddle Shuffle'' (1973)\n*''Ragtime Millionaire'' (1977)\n*''The Tampa Sessions'' (1979)\n*''Bookeroo'' (1988)\n*''The Hillbilly Blues Cats'' (1992)\n*''Live Book\u2026Don't Start Me Talkin'' (1994)\n*''The Radio Show''\n*''Polk City Ramble''  (1998)\n*''Singer Songwriter Bluesman'' (2001)\n*''Live at the Fur Peace Station'' (2005)<ref name=\"AMG\"/>\n*''The Good Book'' (2013)\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.answers.com/topic/roy-book-binder?cat=entertainment Answers.com]\n*[http://www.artistdirect.com/nad/music/artist/card/0,,404357,00.htm Artistdirect.com]\n*[http://blogcritics.org/archives/2006/07/13/101824.php Blogcritics.org]\n*[http://www.furpeaceranch.com/instruct.html Furpeaceranch.com]\n*[http://www.roybookbinder.com/ Roybookbinder.com - Official website]\n\n{{Authority control|VIAF=23807199}}\n{{Persondata <!-- Metadata: see [[Wikipedia:Persondata]]. -->\n| NAME              =Binder, Roy Book\n| ALTERNATIVE NAMES =\n| SHORT DESCRIPTION =[[United States|American]] [[blues]] guitarist\n| DATE OF BIRTH     = October 5, 1941\n| PLACE OF BIRTH    = [[Queens]], [[New York City]], [[United States]]\n| DATE OF DEATH     =\n| PLACE OF DEATH    =\n}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Binder, Roy Book}}\n[[Category:1941 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:American blues singers]]\n[[Category:American blues guitarists]]\n[[Category:Country blues musicians]]\n[[Category:Singers from New York City]]"}]}}}}
