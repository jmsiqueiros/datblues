His teacher was [[Steve Freund]], who taught Specter between the latter's duties at Jazz Record Mart, and [[Delmark Records]]. Freund ultimately organised a [[concert tour]] for Specter alongside Sam Lay and [[Hubert Sumlin]]. Contacts made while working at the B.L.U.E.S. [[nightclub]] secured gigs as a [[sideman]] to [[Johnny Littlejohn]], [[Son Seals]], and [[The Legendary Blues Band]]. By 1989 Specter had organized his own backing band, known as the Bluebirds.<ref name=\"AMG\"/>\n\nBy 1998 Specter had released five albums on the Delmark label, combining a mixture of blues (Specter listed his influences as [[T-Bone Walker]], [[Pee Wee Crayton]], [[Magic Sam]], and [[Otis Rush]]) and jazz ([[Kenny Burrell]] is another inspiration).\n\nSpecter does not sing, and he enlisted [[Barkin' Bill Smith]] as his first vocalist, performing on Specter's 1991 debut [[album]], ''Bluebird Blues''. Specter then made a guest appearance with [[Jesse Fortune]], providing accompaniment on ''Fortune Tellin' Man'' (1993). [[Harmonica]] player and singer [[Tad Robinson]] took over on the Bluebirds' ''Blueplicity'' (1994) and ''Live in Europe'' (1995). Following Robinson's departure, [[Lynwood Slim]] became the band's vocalist.<ref name=\"AMG\"/>\n\nJazz influences prevailed as time passed, and Specter invited [[Brother Jack McDuff]] to play the [[Hammond organ]] on the next album, ''Left Turn on Blue'' (1996). Lenny Lynn took over vocal duties on the following release, ''Blues Spoken Here'' (1998). In 2000, ''Speculatin''' appeared, but here Specter eschewed [[human voice|vocals]] altogether, issuing thirteen [[instrumental]] tracks. ''Is What It Is'' (2004) was followed by ''Live in Chicago'' (2008).<ref name=\"AMG\"/>\n\nIn addition to his recordings, Specter undertakes frequent tours to [[Europe]] and beyond.<ref name=\"AMG\"/>\n\n==Discography==\n*''Bluebird Blues'' (1991)\n*''Blueplicity'' (1994)\n*''Live in Europe'' (1995)\n*''Left Turn on Blue'' (1996)\n*''Blues Spoken Here'' (1998)\n*''Speculatin''' (2000)\n*''Is What It Is'' (2004)\n*''Live in Chicago'' (2008)<ref name=\"Albums\">{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/dave-specter-mn0000682338/discography |title=Dave Specter &#124; Discography |publisher=AllMusic |date=1963-05-21 |accessdate=2014-01-26}}</ref>\n*''Spectified'' (2010)\n\n==Legacy==\n[[Music journalism|Music journalist]], Tony Russell wrote that \"an extended, uncluttered view of Specter's music is noteworthy in his performance at a 1994 [[Germany|German]]  [[concert]], in a quartet with the correspondingly idiomatic harmonica playing and soulful singing of [[Tad Robinson]]\".<ref name=\"russell\">{{cite book\n| first= Tony\n| last= Russell\n| year= 1997\n| title= The Blues: From Robert Johnson to Robert Cray\n| edition= \n| publisher= Carlton Books Limited \n| location= Dubai\n| page= 168\n| isbn= 1-85868-255-X}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of Chicago blues musicians]]\n*[[List of electric blues musicians]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Authority control|VIAF=36112764}}\n{{Persondata <!-- Metadata: see [[Wikipedia:Persondata]]. -->\n| NAME              =Specter, Dave\n| ALTERNATIVE NAMES =\n| SHORT DESCRIPTION =[[United States|American]] [[Chicago blues]] and [[jazz]] guitarist\n| DATE OF BIRTH     =May 21, 1963\n| PLACE OF BIRTH    =[[Chicago]], [[Illinois]], United States\n| DATE OF DEATH     =\n| PLACE OF DEATH    =\n}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Specter, Dave}}\n[[Category:1963 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:American blues guitarists]]\n[[Category:American blues musicians]]\n[[Category:Songwriters from Illinois]]\n[[Category:Jewish American musicians]]\n[[Category:Musicians from Chicago, Illinois]]"}]}}}}
