We was so poor, we didn't know we was poor. But it didn't matter, because we was happy, and we had a loving family. I wouldn't trade it for nothin' in the world. Mom and Dad, y'know, they never had nothin', but we had lots of love. We always had food to eat. We grew big gardens. We killed all the meat we ate. Dad made me a bow and arrow so I could go huntin'. We wouldn't kill 'em for sportsmanship, although that was a proud thing to do. Just for food. And we'd get black walnuts off the trees, and dig out grooves in the maple trees and put buckets on 'em and make some maple candy with the walnuts. Those were our sweet goodies.\"</ref> Although Mack's childhood homes had no electricity, the family had a primitive battery-powered radio and were devotees of \"[[The Grand Ole Opry]]\" radio show.

Mack's instrumental version was well-received, so he adopted it as part of his live act. The tune featured a then-unique combination of several key elements. As recorded in 1963, it had seven distinct sections, with an unusually fast 12-bar blues solo. \"An extended guitar  solo exploiting the entire range of the instrument rings in the climax of the song in the fifth section.

He views himself as a transitional figure: \"I was a bridge-over between the standard country licks in early rock 'n' roll and the screamin' kinda stuff that came later.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n===Transition period===\nIn the mid-1960s, the public's musical tastes shifted radically due to the initial, \"pop\"  phase of the \"[[British Invasion]]\". However, during the same period, the \"[[folk music]]\" movement in the US and the popularity of Black American musical forms in both the US and the  UK expanded the appeal of classic rural and urban blues among young whites of the [[baby boom]] generation.\n\nSoon, a handful of predominantly white blues bands rose to prominence, including [[John Mayall's Bluesbreakers]] in the UK and [[Paul Butterfield|The Paul Butterfield Blues Band]] in the US. During the mid-through-late 1960s, a new generation of electric blues guitarists emerged, including [[Jeff Beck]], [[Eric Clapton]], [[Jimi Hendrix]] and [[Jimmy Page]], most of whom were, or soon became, frontmen for blues-based rock bands. The late 1960s witnessed the appearance of many such bands, most of which showcased the virtuosity of their lead guitarists. These included the enormously successful \"power trios\": [[Cream (band)|Cream]] and [[The Jimi Hendrix Experience]]. By that point, blues-rock was recognized as a distinct and powerful force within rock music on both sides of the [[Atlantic ocean|Atlantic]]. In 1968, these developments led to the rediscovery of Mack's seminal blues-rock guitar recordings of the early 1960s.<ref>Alec Dubrow, Review of \"The Wham of that Memphis Man!, ''Rolling Stone'', November 23, 1968;</ref><ref>Bill Millar, liner notes to album Memphis Wham!</ref>\n\nStill in the mid-1960s, Mack released a succession of new singles on Fraternity, but none charted, and Mack turned to R&B session work. At Cincinnati's premier record label, [[Syd Nathan]]'s King Records, he played second guitar on a number of King-label recordings by blues singer-guitarist [[Freddie King]], and lead guitar on several King-label recordings by \"The Godfather of Soul\", [[James Brown]].<ref name=\"mbnet1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.koti.mbnet.fi/wdd/lonniemack.htm|title=WangDangDula.com|publisher=Koti.mbnet.fi|accessdate=2011-07-27}}</ref> Brown's band can be heard accompanying Mack on Brown's \"Stone Fox\" (1967); beyond that, however, it was a Lonnie Mack R&B guitar instrumental.<ref name=\"MOG\">{{cite web|url=http://mog.com/Spike/blog_post/65881|title=Stone Fox, an anomaly|accessdate=2007-11-19|date= 2007-04-20|publisher=mog.com/Spike/blog_post}}</ref> During the same period, Mack found steady work as a session guitarist for [[John Richbourg]]'s Soundstage 7 Productions in Nashville, backing soul singer [[Joe Simon]] and several other Richbourg R&B acts on Monument Records.<ref>[http://www.swampland.com/articles/view/lonnie-mack Mack interview from 2000]; hear: Joe Simon's album \"Monument of Soul\" on RPM Records, a recent compilation of Simon recordings from that period</ref> He also played lead guitar on several Fraternity recordings of Cincinnati blues singer Albert Washington.<ref>album \"Albert Washington, Blues and Soul Man\" (Ace, 1999) and liner notes thereto by Steven C.

(1999)</ref>\n\n===Rediscovery===\nIn 1968, with the blues-rock movement approaching full force, Mack entered into a multi-record deal with Los Angeles' [[Elektra Records]], and relocated to the West Coast. A feature article in the November 1968 issue of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine rated Mack \"in a class by himself\" as a rock guitarist, and compared his R&B vocals favorably with [[Elvis Presley]]'s best gospel efforts. ''Rolling Stone'' urged Elektra to reissue Mack's 5-year-old Fraternity album. Elektra soon obliged, reissuing ''The Wham of that Memphis Man!'', with two additional 1964 tracks, under the title ''For Collectors Only''. ''Rolling Stone'''s October 1970 review of ''For Collectors Only'' compared Mack's guitar work from the early 1960s to \"the best of [Eric] Clapton\".\n\n''The Wham of that Memphis Man!''/''For Collectors Only'' remains Mack's most significant early album. In his review of a 1987 reissue, Gregory Himes of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' wrote: \"With so many roots-rock guitarists trying to imitate this same style, this album sounds surprisingly modern. Not many have done it this well, though.\"<ref name=\"HimesWP\">{{cite news|title=Lonnie Mack|author=Gregory Himes|publisher=The Washington Post|date=1987-02-20|quote=With so many roots-rock guitarists trying to imitate this same style, this album sounds surprisingly modern. Not many have done it this well, though.}}</ref>\n\n===Elektra years===\nMack recorded three new albums with [[Elektra Records|Elektra]],  ''Glad I'm in the Band'' and ''Whatever's Right'' (both released in 1969) and ''The Hills of Indiana'' (1971). In the aggregate, these albums represented a stark departure from the strengths and stylistic formula represented by Mack's earlier work, previously touted by ''Rolling Stone''. They were eclectic collections country and soul ballads, blues tunes, and updated versions of earlier recordings. In contrast to ''[[The Wham of that Memphis Man]]'', both 1969 albums emphasized Mack's vocals and de-emphasized his guitar work. Only two instrumentals appear on these albums, a full-length blues guitar piece on ''Glad'' entitled \"Mt. Healthy Blues\", and a re-make of \"Memphis\".\n\nDespite the shift in musical emphasis, Mack's output from this period was relatively well received by music critics. This, from a contemporary assessment of ''Glad'':<blockquote>Mack's taste and judgment are super-excellent. Every aspect of his guitar bears a direct relationship to the sound and meaning of the song. [H]is voice is strong without straining and of great range and personality. [I]f this isn't the best rock recording of the season, its the solidest. \u2013 ''Rolling Stone'', May 3, 1969, p. 28.</blockquote>\n\nRepresentative of these two albums were two consecutive vocals on ''Whatever's Right''. Mack sings [[Willie Dixon]]'s \"[[My Babe]]\" in a soul style typical of that era.  Within seconds of the closing measure on that tune, he begins his vocal on \"Things Have Gone To Pieces\", a country tune previously recorded by George Jones.  He repeated the pattern in ''Glad'' by performing a country tune, \"Old House\", and the soul tune, \"Too Much Trouble\" in sequence.\n\nUpon completing the 1969 albums, Mack assumed a \"Chet Atkins-Eric Clapton role at Elektra, doing studio dates, producing and [[A&R]].\"<ref>Rolling Stone, \"Random Notes\", February 7, 1970, p. 4</ref><ref>According to original album notes, in one \"studio date\", Mack was one of the bass-players on [[The Doors]] album \"[[Morrison Hotel]]\".</ref> In that role, Mack recruited a number of country and blues artists from Nashville, Memphis and Muscle Shoals, Alabama, and Elektra flirted with the idea of starting a new label to record them.<ref>Holzman, ''Follow The Music'', First Media, 1998, pp. 366-67</ref> Mack tried to sign [[Carole King]], but Elektra rejected her, on the grounds that they already had [[Judy Collins]].<ref name=\"Gettleman, Orlando Sentinel 1993, p. 3\"/> He also attempted to interest Elektra in gospel singer [[Dorothy Combs Morrison]], formerly lead vocalist for the [[Edwin Hawkins Singers]] of \"[[Oh Happy Day]]\" fame.  Mack recorded Morrison singing a gospel version of \"[[Let It Be (song)|Let It Be]]\" before [[The Beatles]] released their own version, and urged Elektra to release it immediately. However, corporate red-tape at Elektra delayed the release, and The Beatles were first-to-market. Undeterred, he urged Elektra to capitalize on The Beatles' success by releasing Morrison's version next. Further delays at Elektra allowed the next release to be [[Aretha Franklin]]'s own gospel version. \"That...bummed me out\",<ref name=\"Gettleman, Orlando Sentinel 1993, p. 3\"/> Mack said, enough that he resigned his corporate job.<ref>Sandmel, \"Lonnie Mack is Back on the Track\", ''Guitar World'', May 1984, pp. 59-60</ref>\n\nBy that point, Elektra had put together an old-fashioned whistle-stop tour of Mack's band, along with some of Mack's Memphis and Muscle Shoals artists, to be billed as \"The Alabama State Troupers and Mount Zion Choir\".<ref>Holzman, ''Follow The Music'', First Media, 2000, p. 367</ref> According to Elektra producer Russ Miller, Mack disappeared six days before the tour was to begin. Miller soon found Mack at his rustic farm in backwoods Kentucky, and urged him to join the tour. Mack refused, citing a nightmare during his last night in Los Angeles, in which he and his family had been pursued by Satan. He told Miller that when he awoke in a sweat, he found his Bible opened to a passage commanding him to \"flee from Mount Zion\". Miller returned to L.A. without Mack, stating later: \"[Lonnie's] a real country boy. [T]hat was it for Lonnie\".<ref>Holzman, ''Follow the Music'', First Media. 1998, p. 367</ref>\n\n===Country years===\nMack's final Elektra album, ''The Hills of Indiana'', was released in 1971. Foreshadowing the next phase of Mack's career, ''The Hills of Indiana'' completed Mack's shift of focus away from high-octane R&B and blues-rock, towards the pastoral, country end of the musical spectrum. The album sold poorly. His contract with Elektra fulfilled, Mack left L.A. and returned home, soon adopting the roles of low-profile country recording artist, sideman, session-player and occasional roadhouse touring performer. His recordings during this period display only rare glimpses of guitar virtuosity. Over the next fourteen years, he slipped back into a state of relative anonymity.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.geocities.com/badcatrecords/MACKlonnie.htm|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20091028091953/http://www.geocities.com/badcatrecords/MACKlonnie.htm|archivedate=2009-10-28|title=Internet Archive Wayback Machine|publisher=Web.archive.org|date=2009-10-28|accessdate=2011-07-27}}</ref>\n\nYears after leaving Los Angeles, Mack commented on his retreat from the rock 'n' roll spotlight before the age of 30: \"Seems like every time I get close to really making it, to climbing to the top of the mountain, that's when I pull out. I just pull up and run\".<ref name=\"Peter Guralnick 1977, pp. 16-18\"/> The lyrics of several Mack tunes shed further light on the topic. According to two, he yearned for the anonymous, uncomplicated country life of his youth.<ref>\"Country\", 1976: ''I don't care what you think of me, I'm a-gonna live my life bein' country. Had a fancy job out in Hollywood, everybody said I was doin' good. Had lots of money and opportunities, but I'm a-gonna live my life bein' country.''; hear also: Title track from Mack's 1971 album, \"Hills of Indiana\"</ref> In another, he equated the pursuit of \"fortune and fame\" with selling one's soul to Satan.<ref>Song: \"A Song I Haven't Sung\", track 10 on album \"Second Sight\", Alligator, 1986</ref> In yet another, he stated simply: ''\"L.A. made me sick.\"''<ref>\"A Long Way From Memphis\", track 4 on \"Strike Like Lightning\" album, Alligator (1985)</ref>\n\nIn 1973, Mack teamed up with [[Rusty York]] on an all-acoustic bluegrass LP, ''Dueling Banjos'' (QCA No. 304). Unavailable for 35 years, Jewel Records re-issued it on CD in 2009 (JRC 920011).  It contains 16 bluegrass standards in a dueling-banjos format, with guitar and fiddle. Mack played guitar on all 16 cuts and provided the sole vocal track (the gospel tune \"I'll Fly Away\") on this otherwise instrumental album.<ref>{{cite web|author=Staff|url=http://www.tradebit.com/filedetail.php/8133219-rusty-york-lonnie-mack|title=Lonnie Mack teams up with Rusty York|publisher=Tradebit.com|date=2005-06-19|accessdate=2011-07-27}}</ref>\n\nIn 1974, Mack played lead guitar in [[Dobie Gray]]'s band. Gray is best known for his hit tunes, \"[[The 'In' Crowd]]\" (later covered by [[The Ramsey Lewis Trio]] and others), \"[[Drift Away]]\" and \"Loving Arms\". Mack's guitar work from this period can be found on Gray's 1974 album ''Hey, Dixie''. Mack wrote or co-wrote four tunes on the album, including the title track.<ref>{{cite web|last=Planer|first=Lindsay|url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r39349|pure_url=yes}}|title=Hey Dixie - Dobie Gray|publisher=AllMusic|accessdate=2011-07-27}}</ref> In March 1974, Mack performed as Gray's lead guitarist at the last broadcast of The Grand Ole Opry from Nashville's [[Ryman Auditorium]].\n\nIn 1975, Mack was shot during an altercation with an off-duty police officer. His account of the incident is preserved in one of his better-known late-career tunes, \"Cincinnati Jail\".<ref>A studio version of the tune appears as track 5 of the album ''Second Sight''. A live version appears as track 8 of the album ''Attack of the Killer V.''</ref> According to the lyrics of that tune, the officer's unmarked car narrowly missed Mack while he was walking across a city street, whereupon Mack hit it on the fender, shouting \"better slow it down!\"; the officer stopped, emerged from his car, shot Mack \"in the leg\", then hauled him before a judge who threw him in jail. Mack recovered, but once again virtually disappeared from the music scene. For the next several years, he rarely performed in public, except at his \"Friendship Music Park\" in rural southern Indiana, where he showcased bluegrass and traditional country artists.<ref name=\"Guralnick\"/>\n\nIn 1977, Mack signed with [[Capitol Records]]. There, he recorded ''Home at Last'', an album of country ballads and bluegrass tunes which attracted little attention.  In 1978, he recorded another Capitol LP, ''Lonnie Mack with Pismo''. A somewhat faster-paced album, ''Pismo'' featured country, southern rock and rockabilly tunes. In 1979, Mack began working on an independent recording project with a friend, producer-songwriter Ed Labunski.<ref name=\"Rockabillybio\"/> The intended result was a country-pop album ultimately entitled ''South''.<ref>Cincinnati Magazine - Jun 1986 - Page 73 \" ... neither of which received much attention, Mack teamed up with an old friend named Ed Labunski to form a group called South \"</ref> However, Labunski died in an auto accident before the project was completed, and the album was shelved. Mack released demos from the project 20 years later. Labunski's death also derailed Mack's and Labunski's plans to produce then-unknown Texas blues-guitar prodigy [[Stevie Ray Vaughan]], who was destined to play a key role in Mack's blues-rock comeback a few years later.<ref name=\"Rockabillybio\">[http://rockabillyhall.com.LonnieMack1.html/] {{dead link|date=May 2014}}</ref>\n\nShortly after Labunski's death, Mack traveled to Canada, where he entered into a six-month collaboration with American expatriate rockabilly artist [[Ronnie Hawkins]].  Hawkins is best known for having founded The Hawks, a popular Canadian roots-rock group which became [[Bob Dylan]]'s backup musicians and, later still, independently famous as [[The Band]]. Mack's guitar work from this period can be heard on Hawkins' 1981 solo album, ''Legend In His Spare Time''.<ref name=\"Mack Discography\"/>\n\n===Blues-rock comeback===\nBy the early 1980s, Mack had been largely absent from the rock music scene for over a decade and his visibility as a recording artist  had waned considerably. He chose this low point in his career to resume performing and touring, emphasizing a hard-driving blues-rock/rockabilly fusion style that became the cornerstone of his sound for the rest of his career. His first album from this period was ''Live at Coco's'', recorded in 1983. It is Mack's only mid-career roadhouse performance preserved on disc. Originally a \"bootleg\" recording, Mack sanctioned its commercial release in 1998.<ref name=\"mbnet1\"/> On ''Coco's'', Mack and his band can be heard playing familiar tunes from the Fraternity era, lesser-known tunes from the 1970s, tunes which appear on no other album (e.g., \"Stormy Monday\", \"The Things I Used To Do\"  and \"Man From Bowling Green\") and tunes which did not appear on his studio albums until several years later (e.g., \"Falling Back In Love With You\", \"Ridin' the Blinds\", \"Cocaine Blues\" and \"High Blood Pressure\").\n\nStill in 1983, Mack relocated to Texas, where he played regularly at venues in Dallas and Austin. Early in this period, Mack entered into a performing collaboration with Stevie Ray Vaughan. Little known outside of Texas in 1980, Vaughan's own career took off during this period; by 1985 he was an international blues-rock guitar sensation. Mack and Vaughan had first met in 1979,<ref name=\"UnsungGibson\">[http://www.gibson.com/en-us/Lifestyle/Features/Unsung%20Guitar%20Hero%20Lonnie%20Mack/ \"Unsung Guitar Hero Lonnie Mack\"], Gibson Lifestyle, 2007,</ref> when Mack, acting on a tip from Vaughan's older brother, went to hear him play at a local bar. Vaughan recalled the meeting in a 1985 interview: {{Quotation|I was playin' at the Rome Inn in Austin, and we had just hit the opening chords of \"Wham!\" when this big guy walked in. He looked just like a great big bear. As soon as I looked at his face, I realized who he was, and naturally he was blown away to hear us doing his song. [W]e talked for a long time that night. [Lonnie said] he wanted to produce us.|Stevie Ray Vaughan, as quoted in Sandmel, \"Rock Pioneer Lonnie Mack In Session With Stevie Ray Vaughan\"|''Guitar Player'', April 1985, p. 33}}\n\nMack and Vaughan became close friends after that first meeting. Despite the generation gap between them, Mack said that he and Vaughan \"were always on the same level\", describing  Vaughan as \"an old spirit...in a young man's body\".<ref>1990 Lonnie Mack interview by Rikki Dee Hall.</ref> Mack regarded Vaughan as his \"little brother\" and Vaughan said Mack was \"something between a daddy and a brother\".<ref name=swampland>{{cite web|url=http://swampland.com/articles/view/all/501|title=Michael Smith, \"Gritz Speaks With Guitar Hero Lonnie Mack\", June 2000|publisher=Swampland.com|accessdate=2011-07-27}}</ref><ref>SRV interview, ''Guitar World'', November 1985, p. 30</ref> When Mack was stricken with a lengthy illness in Texas, Vaughan put on a benefit concert to help pay his bills; during  Mack's recuperation, Vaughan and his bass-player, [[Tommy Shannon]], personally installed an air-conditioner in his house.<ref name=swampland/>\n\nVaughan said that \"Wham!\" was \"the first record I ever owned\",<ref name=\"SRVDVD\"/> that Mack was \"the baddest guitar player I know\",<ref>As heard on bootleg DVD entitled \"American Caravan: Stevie Ray Vaughan and Double Trouble\", recorded in 1986 at the Orpheum Theatre in Memphis</ref> and that Mack \"really taught me to play guitar from the heart\".<ref name=\"HistoryoftheBlues\">{{cite book|last=Davis|first=Francis|title=History of the Blues|publisher=Da Capo Press|date=2003-09-02|isbn=0-306-81296-7|page=246}}</ref> Vaughan's musical legacy includes four versions of \"Wham!\"---two solo versions<ref>Video: Live at the Mocambo; Album: The Sky is Crying</ref> and two dueling-guitar versions with Mack.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v+rjdbXwD-xnk|title=Strike like Lightning|publisher=Youtube.com|accessdate=2011-07-27}}</ref> He also recorded Mack's \"If You Have To Know\",<ref>Album: SRV and Double Trouble: Box Set, Disc 2</ref> and an instrumental homage to \"Chicken-Pickin\", which Vaughan called \"Scuttle-Buttin'\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blues.about.com/od/cddvdreviews/fr/Stevie-Ray-Vaughan-Couldnt-Stand-The-Weather.htm|title=...the Lonnie Mack-inspired instrumental|publisher=Blues.about.com|date=1984-08-17|accessdate=2011-07-27}}</ref><ref>Albums: SRV and Double Trouble: Box Set, Disc 2 and Live at Carnegie Hall; Vaughan said he \"dedicated\" the tune to Mack.

Mack himself composed most of the tunes, which featured his vocals and driving guitar equally. Vaughan played second guitar on most of the album, and traded leads with Mack on \"Double Whammy\" and \"Satisfy Susie\". Both played acoustic guitar on Mack's \"Oreo Cookie Blues\". ''Strike'' propelled Mack back into the spotlight at age 44. Much of 1985 found him occupied with a promotional concert tour for ''Strike'' which included guest appearances by Vaughan, [[Ry Cooder]] and both [[Keith Richards]] and [[Ronnie Wood]] of the [[Rolling Stones]], among others. Videos of Mack and Vaughan playing cuts from ''Strike'' are found on [[YouTube]] and similar websites. In 2007, Sony's Legacy label released a 1987 \"live\" performance of Mack's \"Oreo Cookie Blues\" featuring Mack and Vaughan trading leads on electric guitar.<ref name=\"SRVCD\">CD, ''SRV: Solos, Sessions and Encores'', track 7, Epic/Legacy, 2007</ref>\n\nThe ''Strike Like Lightning'' tour culminated in a [[Carnegie Hall]] concert billed as ''Further On Down the Road'', a tip of the hat to Mack's 1964 recording by the same title. There, he shared the stage with blues guitar stylist [[Albert Collins]] and blues-rock guitar virtuoso [[Roy Buchanan]]. The concert was marketed on home video and remains available from Flying V Records on Mack's website. {{Citation needed|date=June 2013}}\n\n===Late career===\nIn 1986, Mack recorded another Alligator album, ''Second Sight'', which featured both introspective and up-tempo tunes as well as an instrumental blues jam. In 1988, he moved to [[Epic Records]], where he recorded the critically acclaimed<ref>Guterman, ''Rolling Stone'', December 1, 1988</ref> rockabilly album, ''Roadhouses and Dance Halls'', including the autobiographical single, \"Too Rock For Country\".<ref name=\"Mack Discography\"/>\n[[File:Lonnie Mack-Live-Attack of the Killer V.jpg|thumb|''Live! \u2013 Attack of the Killer V''<br/> album cover]]\n\nIn 1990, Mack returned to Alligator to record a live blues-rock album, ''Attack of the Killer V'', featuring two extended guitar solos and expanded renditions of earlier studio recordings. From one review: \"This disc has everything that a great live album should have: a great talent on stage, an exciting performance from that talent, a responsive crowd and excellent sound quality ... This is what live blues is all about!\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://members.tripod.com/~djd3/mack.html|title=\"Live! - Attack of the Killer V\" Review|publisher=Members.tripod.com|accessdate=2011-07-27}}</ref> Although Mack continued to tour in both America and Europe until 2004, he has not released a full album since ''Attack of the Killer''. In 2000, he appeared as a session player on the album ''Franktown Blues'', by the sons of blues legend [[Arthur \"Big Boy\" Crudup]]. Mack provided guitar solos on two cuts, \"She's Got The Key\" and \"Jammin' For James\".<ref>{{cite web|author=Bo Baber|url=http://www.warehousecreek.com/frank/reviews.htm|title=Review of Franktown Blues|publisher=Warehousecreek.com|date=2000-05-31|accessdate=2011-07-27}}</ref>\n\n===Today===\nIn recent years, Mack has occasionally appeared at benefit concerts and special events.<ref name=\"Poconut\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://pureprairieleague.com/benefit/index.htm|title=Photo of Mack playing at concert|publisher=Pureprairieleague.com|accessdate=2011-07-27}}</ref><ref>[http://www.pureprairieleague.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=830&sid=c35c58dc4fdc2965e52914f77c4ea2a5]{{dead link|date=July 2011}}</ref> On November 15, 2008, Mack was a featured performer at the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]]'s 13th annual Music Masters Tribute Concert, soloing on \"Wham!\" in honor of electric guitar pioneer [[Les Paul]].<ref name=\"cleveland.com\"/> He is an occasional surprise sit-in with house bands at roadhouses in rural Tennessee.<ref>http://www.thegearpage.net/board/showthread.php?t=532235</ref> On June 5\u20136, 2010, Mack appeared in concert with the surviving members of his original band.<ref name=\"Lonnie Mack\"/> Reportedly, he has been working on a memoir<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rockabillyhall.com/NewsArch02.html|title=Lonnie Mack Comes Back To Life|publisher=Rockabillyhall.com|accessdate=2011-07-27}}</ref> and is engaged in a songwriting collaboration with award-winning country and blues tunesmith Bobby Boyd.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bobbyboydband.com/bio.html|title=Bobby Boyd profile at|publisher=Bobbyboydband.com|accessdate=2011-07-27}}</ref>\n\n==Guitar style and technique==\nFrom inception, Mack's rock-guitar style was steeped in the blues. However, he routinely used fast-paced \"[[fingerstyle]]\" and \"[[chicken picking]]\" techniques and runs with origins in traditional country and bluegrass styles. This distinguished Mack from most of the blues-rock guitarists who rose to prominence in the decade following \"Memphis\", guitarists whose styles had evolved more exclusively from the Delta and Chicago blues traditions. {{Citation needed|date=June 2013}}\n\nMack typically manipulates the whammy bar with the little finger of his right hand, while picking at a 45-degree angle with a pick or the remaining fingers of the same hand, and bending the strings on the fret-board with his left.<ref>Gene Santoro, \"Double Whammy\", ''Guitar World'', January 1986, p. 34</ref> Stevie Ray Vaughan: \"Nobody can play with a whammy-bar like Lonnie.
