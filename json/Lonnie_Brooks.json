He was born in  Dubuisson, [[Louisiana]], [[United States]].<ref name=\"russell\"/>  ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' stated, \"His music is witty, soulful and ferociously energetic, brimming with novel harmonic turnarounds, committed vocals and simply astonishing guitar work.\"<ref name=RS>Palmer, Robert. ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', 31 May 1979</ref>  ''[[The New York Times]]'' added, \"He sings in a rowdy baritone, sliding and rasping in songs that celebrate lust, fulfilled and unfulfilled; his guitar solos are pointed and unhurried, with a tone that slices cleanly across the beat. Wearing a cowboy hat, he looks like the embodiment of a good-time bluesman.\"<ref name=NYT>Parales, Jon. ''The New York Times'', 16 March 1992</ref>\n\n==Career==\nHe learned to play blues from his banjo-picking grandfather, but did not think about a professional career until he moved to [[Port Arthur, Texas]] in the early 1950s. There he heard live performances by [[Clarence \"Gatemouth\" Brown]], [[T-Bone Walker]], [[B.B. King]], [[Long John Hunter]] and others and began to think about making money from his music. One day, while Brooks was strumming his guitar on his front porch in Port Arthur, [[Clifton Chenier]] heard him and offered him a job in his touring band.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}\n\nEmbarking on a solo career, he adopted the moniker of '''Guitar Junior''' and signed with [[Lake Charles (Louisiana)|Lake Charles]]'s Goldband label.  His singles for the label included regional hit \"Family Rules\", which remains a favorite of the [[swamp pop]] idiom in [[Acadiana|south Louisiana]] and [[southeast Texas]].<ref name=\"sp\">Shane K. Bernard, ''Swamp Pop: Cajun and Creole Rhythm and Blues'' (Jackson: University Press of Mississippi, 1996), p. 58.</ref> Other Goldband singles included \"Made In The Shade\" and \"The Crawl\" (later recorded by [[The Fabulous Thunderbirds]]).\n\nIn 1960, he moved to [[Chicago]], Illinois. [[Luther Johnson (Guitar Junior)|Luther Johnson]] was already using the name 'Guitar Junior' there, so he adopted the alternative stage name, Lonnie Brooks.<ref name=\"russell\">{{cite book\n| first= Tony\n| last= Russell\n| year= 1997\n| title= The Blues: From Robert Johnson to Robert Cray\n| edition= \n| publisher= Carlton Books Limited \n| location= Dubai\n| isbn= 1-85868-255-X\n| page= 95}}</ref>\nIn Chicago, he found regular work in the West Side clubs as well as in [[Gary, Indiana|Gary]] and [[East Chicago]], Indiana and occasionally in the Rush Street North Side entertainment area. He cut a series of 45s for a variety of labels, including [[Chess Records|Chess]], Chirrup, [[Mercury Records|Mercury]], [[Midas Records|Midas]] and USA Records, achieving some local radio airplay. He also supported other artists on record and live, including [[Jimmy Reed]]. In 1961 he played guitar on the double album, ''[[Jimmy Reed at Carnegie Hall]]''.\n\nIn 1969, he recorded his first album, ''Broke An\u2019 Hungry'', for the [[Capitol Records|Capitol]] label. It was produced by Wayne Shuler, son of [[Eddie Shuler]], who had founded Goldband Records in Louisiana.\n\nIn 1974, Brooks participated in a multi-artist tour of Europe, and cut an album entitled ''Sweet Home Chicago'' for the French label [[Black & Blue Records|Black & Blue]]. When he returned to Chicago, he began playing regularly at Pepper\u2019s Hideout on the Chicago's [[South Side of Chicago|South Side]]. There he attracted the attention of [[Bruce Iglauer]], head of the fledgling [[Alligator Records]] label, who had previously seen him a number of times at the Avenue Lounge on the city\u2019s West Side.\n\nIn 1978, Iglauer included four of Brooks\u2019 songs (including three originals) on an anthology  series entitled ''Living Chicago Blues'', released by Alligator Records. He was signed to the label, and the following year, he released his album ''Bayou Lightning'' on the Alligator label.<ref name=\"amg\">[{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p288|pure_url=yes}} Allmusic biography - accessed February 2008]</ref>  The album won the 'Grand Prix du Disque Award' from the 1980 [[Montreux Jazz Festival]]. While in Montreux, Brooks befriended country star [[Roy Clark]]. Clark was impressed with Brooks, and he arranged for an appearance on the country music television program ''[[Hee Haw]]''.\n\nSince that time, Brooks has recorded exclusively for the Alligator, releasing seven albums as well as shared recordings and compilation appearances. Brooks' style, sometimes described as \"voodoo blues\", includes elements of [[Chicago blues]], [[Louisiana blues]], [[swamp pop]] and [[rhythm and blues]].  Other labels have issued pre-1978 recordings by Brooks as well as compilations of Brooks' singles.\n\nFollowing the release of ''Bayou Lightning'', Brooks began touring nationwide as well as returning to Europe. A 1982 trip to Germany resulted in an hour-long Brooks live performance on German television. His 1983 follow-up album was ''Hot Shot''. 1986's ''Wound Up Tight'' featured a guest appearance by Brooks' most famous fan, [[Johnny Winter]], on guitar. ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' took notice of the album, running a six-page feature on Brooks. And in 1987, [[BBC Radio]] broadcast an hour-long live performance.\n\nBy this time, Brooks' teenage son, [[Ronnie Baker Brooks]], was touring with the band. He made his recording debut on his father's ''Live From Chicago\u2014Bayou Lightning Strikes''. Brooks\u2019 1991 release, ''Satisfaction Guaranteed'', received major media coverage, including features and articles in ''[[The Washington Post]]'', ''[[The Village Voice]]'', ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'', ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', ''[[Guitar World]]'', ''[[Living Blues]]'', ''Blues Revue'', and many other publications.\n\nBrooks spent the summer of 1993 on a national concert tour with [[B.B. King]], [[Buddy Guy]], [[Koko Taylor]], [[Junior Wells]] and [[Eric Johnson]]. During the Chicago stop of his 1995 \u201cFrom The Cradle\u201d club tour, [[Eric Clapton]] honored Brooks by inviting the bluesman on stage for an impromptu jam at Buddy Guy's Legends club.\n\nIn 1996, Brooks released ''Roadhouse Rules''. The album was produced in Memphis by [[Jim Gaines]], who also produced [[Luther Allison]], [[Stevie Ray Vaughan]] and [[Santana (band)|Santana]], and his son Ronnie Baker Brooks appeared again. In 1999, along with fellow Gulf Coast blues veterans [[Long John Hunter]] and [[Phillip Walker]] (both of whom he had known and played with in the 1950s in Port Arthur), Brooks released ''Lone Star Shootout''.<ref>{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r416421/credits|pure_url=yes}} |title=Allmusic ((( ''Lone Star Shootout'' > Review )))}}</ref>\n\nBrooks continues to tour in the U.S. and Europe. His sons, Ronnie Baker Brooks and [[Wayne Baker Brooks]], are also full-time blues entertainers, fronting their own bands and touring extensively in the U.S. and abroad. Wayne Baker Brooks continues to play in his father's band as well. The Brooks' are frequent guest performers at each other's shows and have booked appearances as 'The Brooks Family'.\n\nBesides his live and recorded performances, Brooks appeared in the films ''[[Blues Brothers 2000]]'' and ''[[The Express]]'' and in two UK television commercials for [[Heineken]] beer. His song \"Eyeballin'\" was heard in ''Forever LuLu'', and \"Got Lucky Last Night\" featuring [[Johnny Winter]] appeared in [[John Candy]]'s ''[[Masters of Menace]]''. He also co-authored the book ''Blues for Dummies'', along with son Wayne Baker Brooks and music historian, guitarist, and songwriter, [[Cub Koda]].\n\n==Quotation==\n''\"If my hands could get what my eyes see\"'' he sang in \"Eyeballin'\", ''\"then my whole mind and body would be trouble-free.\"''<ref name=\"russell\"/>\n\n==Discography==\n* 1999 ''Lone Star Shootout'' (with Long John Hunter and Phillip Walker) ([[Alligator Records|Alligator]])\n* 1997 ''Deluxe Edition'' (Alligator)\n* 1996 ''Roadhouse Rules'' (Alligator)\n* 1993 ''Let\u2019s Talk It Over'' (1977 session), ([[Delmark Records|Delmark]])\n* 1991 ''Satisfaction Guaranteed'' (Alligator)\n* 1988 ''Live From Chicago-Bayou Lightning Strikes'' (Alligator)\n* 1986 ''Wound Up Tight'' (Alligator)\n* 1985 ''Live at Pepper\u2019s'' (Black Magic) (reissued on [[Black Top Records|Black Top]], 1996)\n* 1984 ''The Crawl'' (Charly) (reissue of Goldband singles)\n* 1983 ''Hot Shot'' (Alligator)\n* 1981 ''Turn On The Night'' (Alligator)\n* 1980 ''Blues Deluxe'' (Alligator/[[WXRT]])\n* 1979 ''Bayou Lightning''  (Alligator)\n* 1978 ''Living Chicago Blues, Vol.3'' (Alligator)\n* 1975 ''Sweet Home Chicago'' (Black & Blue)  (reissued on Evidence Records, 1994)\n* 1969 ''Broke An' Hungry'' ([[Capitol Records|Capitol]])\n\n==See also==\n*[[Blues Hall of Fame]]\n*[[List of blues musicians]]\n*[[Excello Records]]\n*[[Long Beach Blues Festival]]\n*[[San Francisco Blues Festival]]\n*[[Chicago Blues Festival]]\n*''[[The Express]]'', \"The Ernie Davie Story\" as \"Lonnie Brooks\"\n*''[[Blues Brothers 2000]]'' as himself \"Lonnie Brooks\"\n*''[[Hee Haw]]'' TV show as himself \"Lonnie Brooks\"\n*''[[Soul Train]]'' as himself  \"Lonnie Brooks\" performing song \"The Flip\"\n*[[Blues Hall of Fame]] Inductee 2010\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.lonniebrooks.com/ Lonnie Brooks Official website]\n*[http://www.alligator.com/index.cfm?section=artists&artistid=6 Bio at Alligator Records]\n*{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p288}}\n*{{myspace|lonniebrooksbluesband}}\n*[http://www.piedmonttalent.com/bios.cfm?ID=60 Piedmont Talent - Biography and Future Tour Dates]\n\n{{Authority control|VIAF=100313144}}\n\n{{Persondata\n| NAME              =Baker Jr., Lee\n| ALTERNATIVE NAMES =Brooks, Lonnie\n| SHORT DESCRIPTION =American [[blues]] singer and guitarist\n| DATE OF BIRTH     =December 18, 1933\n| PLACE OF BIRTH    =Dubuisson, Louisiana, United States\n| DATE OF DEATH     =\n| PLACE OF DEATH    =\n}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Brooks, Lonnie}}\n[[Category:1933 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:American blues guitarists]]\n[[Category:American blues singers]]\n[[Category:Louisiana blues musicians]]\n[[Category:People from St. Landry Parish, Louisiana]]\n[[Category:Swamp pop music]]\n[[Category:Chess Records artists]]\n[[Category:Contemporary blues musicians]]"}]}}}}
