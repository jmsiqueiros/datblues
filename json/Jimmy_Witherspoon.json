S. [[Armed Forces Radio Service]] during [[World War II]]. Witherspoon made his first [[gramophone record|records]] with [[Jay McShann]]'s band in 1945. In 1949, recording under his own name with the McShann band, he had his first hit, \"[[Ain't Nobody's Business]],\"<ref name=\"official_bio\"/> a song which came to be regarded as his signature tune. In 1950 he had hits with two more songs closely identified with him: \"No Rollin' Blues\", \"Big Fine Girl\", as well as \"Failing By Degrees\" and \"New Orleans Woman\" recorded with the Gene Gilbeaux Orchestra which included Herman Washington and Don Hill on the Modern Records label. These were recorded from a live performance on May 10, 1949 at a \"Just Jazz\" concert Pasadena, CA sponsored by [[Gene Norman]]. Another classic Witherspoon composition is \"Times Gettin' Tougher Than Tough\".\n\nWitherspoon's style of blues - that of the \"[[blues shouter]]\" - became unfashionable in the mid-1950s, but he returned to popularity with his 1959 album, ''Jimmy Witherspoon at the Monterey Jazz Festival'', which featured [[Roy Eldridge]], [[Woody Herman]], [[Ben Webster]], [[Coleman Hawkins]], [[Earl Hines]] and [[Mel Lewis]], among others.<ref name=\"russell\">{{cite book\n| first= Tony\n| last= Russell\n| year= 1997\n| title= The Blues - From [[Robert Johnson (musician)|Robert Johnson]] to [[Robert Cray]]\n| edition= \n| publisher=Carlton Books Limited \n| location= Dubai\n| pages= 192\n| isbn= 1-85868-255-X}}</ref> He later recorded with [[Gerry Mulligan]], [[Leroy Vinnegar]], [[Richard Holmes (organist)|Richard \"Groove\" Holmes]] and [[T-Bone Walker]].<ref name=\"official_bio\"/>\n\n==Tours and successes==\nIn 1961 he toured Europe with [[Buck Clayton]] and returned to the UK on many occasions, featuring on a mid-sixties live UK recording ''Spoon Sings and Swings'' (1966) with tenor sax player [[Dick Morrissey]]'s quartet.
