He then decided to relocate to [[Los Angeles]] where he became a [[sideman]] for [[Percy Mayfield]] and Deacon Jones. He also worked in the [[musical ensemble|bands]] of [[John Lee Hooker]] and [[Joe Tex]].<ref name=\"AMG\"/>\n\nIn 1981 he became the guitarist for [[Canned Heat]].<ref name=\"AMG\"/> This led to an invitation to play in [[John Mayall's Bluesbreakers]] where he shared the stage with fellow guitarist [[Coco Montoya]]. He left the Bluesbreakers in 1989 and formed the 'Walter Trout Band' which developed a successful following in Europe.\n\nIn 1994 the official Walter Trout Fan Club for the [[Netherlands]] and [[Belgium]] was founded, followed in 1996 by the official International Fan Club which has members in 14 countries in Europe, America, Asia and Australia. In 2006 the official International Fan club celebrated its tenth anniversary by giving fan club members an exclusive live [[Compact disc|CD]]  recorded in [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]], [[Nevada]], which was the last performance of the late [[bassist]], Jimmy Trapp, who died in 2005.\n\nIn 1998 Trout released his self-titled [[United States|US]] debut [[album]] and renamed his band 'Walter Trout and the Free Radicals' (later renamed 'Walter Trout and the Radicals' and currently simply 'Walter Trout'). Since that time Trout has been recording and touring in North America, Europe and India.\n\nIn 2002, he was featured on the [[Bo Diddley]] [[tribute album]], ''Hey Bo Diddley - A Tribute!'', performing the song \"[[Road Runner (Bo Diddley song)|Road Runner]]\" and many more guest appearances on other [[sound recording and reproduction|recordings]].\n\nIn 2014, his album, ''Luther's Blues'', was nominated for a [[Blues Music Award]] in the 'Rock Blues Album of the Year' category.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blues.about.com/od/bluesawards/a/2014-Blues-Music-Awards.htm |title=2014 Blues Music Awards Nominees and Winners |publisher=Blues.about.com |date= |accessdate=2014-05-16}}</ref>\n\n==Discography==\n[[File:Walter Trout 02.JPG|thumb|200px|Walter Trout in concert at [[Skanderborg Festival]] 2007, Denmark]]\n'''Walter Trout Band'''\n* 1990  ''Life in the Jungle'' (re-released in US in 2002)\n* 1990  ''Prisoner of a Dream''\n* 1992  ''Transition''\n* 1992  ''No More Fish Jokes'' ([[live album]])\n* 1994  ''Tellin' Stories''\n* 1995  ''Breaking The Rules''\n* 1996  ''Jimi Hendrix Music Festival (Janblues)\n* 1997  ''Positively Beale St.''\n\n'''Walter Trout and the Free Radicals '''\n* 1998  ''Walter Trout'' (same tracks as ''Positively Beale St.'')\n* 1999  ''Livin' Every Day''\n* 2000  ''Face The Music (Live on Tour)''\n* 2000  ''Live Trout''\n\n'''[[John Mayall's Bluesbreakers]] featuring Walter Trout'''\n* 1985  ''Behind the Iron Curtain'' (live in Hungary), reissue:\n** 2004  ''Steppin' Out''\n* 1987  ''Chicago Line'', reissues:\n** 1994  ''Uncle John's Nickel Guitar''\n** 1999  ''Blues Power'' (with bonus CD ''Life in the Jungle: Charly Blues Masterworks Vol. 4'')\n** 2000  ''Blues Breaker'' (with 2 bonus tracks)\n* 1988  ''The Power of the Blues'' (live in Germany 1987), reissues:\n** 1993  ''New Bluesbreakers: The Blues Collection Vol. 8''\n** 2003  ''Blues Forever'' (with bonus CD ''Life in the Jungle: Charly Blues Masterworks Vol. 4'')\n* 1993  ''Life in the Jungle: Charly Blues Masterworks Vol. 4''\n* 2005  ''Rolling with the Blues'' (live 1972-1973, 1980 and 1982), reissue:\n** 2006  ''The Private Collection''\n\n'''Walter Trout and the Radicals '''\n* 2001  ''Go The Distance''\n* 2003  ''Relentless''\n* 2005  ''Deep Trout: The Early Years of Walter Trout''\n* 2006  ''Full Circle'' (featuring guest artists)\n* 2007  ''Hardcore'' (self released recording of the 'Power Trio' playing live in Europe)\n\n'''Walter Trout'''\n* 2008  ''The Outsider''\n* 2009  ''Unspoiled By Progress: 20 Years of Hardcore Blues'' (previously unreleased tracks and three new songs)\n* 2010  ''Common Ground''\n* 2012  ''Blues For The Modern Daze'' - Produced Engineered & Mixed By - [[Eric Corne]],  Mastered by [[Maor Appelbaum]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Commons category|Walter Trout}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.waltertrout.com/ Waltertrout.com] - Official Website of Walter Trout and Official Global Fan Club.\n*[http://waltertroutfanclub.nl waltertroutfanclub.nl] - Official Website of Dutch Walter Trout Fanclub.\n*[http://www.intrepidartists.com/waltertrout.html Intrepid Records] \u2013 Artist page.\n*[http://www.modernguitars.com/archives/002328.html 2006 Walter Trout interview] by Brian D.
