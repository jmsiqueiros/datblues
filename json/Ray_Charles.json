In his early years, Charles showed a curiosity for mechanical things and he often watched the neighborhood men working on their cars and farm machinery. His musical curiosity was sparked at Mr. Wiley Pit's Red Wing Cafe when Pit played [[boogie woogie]] on an old [[upright piano]]. Pit would care for George, Ray's brother, so as to take the burden off Aretha. However, George drowned in Aretha's laundry tub when he was four years old.<ref name=SwingMusicBio /> After witnessing the death of his brother, Ray would feel an overwhelming sense of guilt later on in life.\n\nCharles started to lose his sight at the age of five and went completely [[blindness|blind]] by the age of seven, apparently due to [[glaucoma]].<ref name=\"boheme\">[http://www.boheme-magazine.net/july04/charles.html ''Boh\u00e8me Magazine''] Obituary: Ray Charles (1930 &ndash; 2004).</ref><ref name=\"60min\">[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/10/14/60minutes/main649346.shtml \"The Genius of Ray Charles\"], an article about an 1986 segment on Charles from ''[[60 Minutes]]''.</ref> He attended school at the [[Florida School for the Deaf and the Blind]] in [[St. Augustine, Florida|St. Augustine]] from 1937 to 1945,<ref name=Lydon /> where he developed his musical talent.<ref name=\"boheme\" /> During this time he performed on [[WFOY]] radio in St. Augustine. His father died when he was 10, his mother five years later.\n\nIn school, Charles was taught only classical music, but he wanted to play the jazz and blues he heard on the family radio.<ref name=Lydon>Lydon, Michael: Ray Charles, pp. 29\u201338.</ref> While at school, he became the school's premier musician. On Fridays, the South Campus Literary Society held assemblies where Charles would play piano and sing popular songs. On Halloween and Washington's birthday, the Colored Department of the school had socials where Charles would play. It was here he established \"RC Robinson and the Shop Boys\" and sang his own arrangement of \"Jingle Bell Boogie.\"<ref>Lydon, Michael, p. 19</ref> He spent his first Christmas at the school, but later the staff pitched in so that Charles could return to Greenville, as he did each summer.\n\nHenry and Alice Johnson, who owned a store not unlike Mr. Pit's store in Greenville, moved to the [[Frenchtown (Tallahassee)|French town]] section of [[Tallahassee, Florida|Tallahassee]], just west of Greenville; they, as well as Freddy and Margaret Bryant, took Charles in. Charles worked the register in the Bryants' store under the direction of their daughter Lucille. It's said he loved Tallahassee and often used the drug store delivery boy's motorbike to run up and down hills using the exhaust sound of a friend's bike to guide him. Charles found Tallahassee musically exciting too, and sat in with the [[Florida A&M University]] student band. He played with the Adderley brothers, [[Nat Adderley|Nat]] and [[Cannonball Adderley|Cannonball]], and began playing gigs with the musical act \"Lawyer Smith and his Band\" in 1943 at the Red Bird Club and Deluxe Clubs in Frenchtown and [[Receiving house|roadhouse]] theaters around Tallahassee, as well as the Governor's Ball.\n\n==Career==\n\n===Early career===\nRay Charles left school after his mother died in 1946, when he was 15 years old. He moved to [[Jacksonville, Florida|Jacksonville]] with a couple who were friends of his mother. For over a year, he played the piano for bands at the [[Ritz Theatre (Jacksonville)|Ritz Theatre]] in [[LaVilla, Jacksonville, Florida|LaVilla]], earning $4 a night. Then he moved to [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]], and later [[Tampa]], where he played with a [[Southern United States|southern]] band called The Florida Playboys. This is where he began his habit of always wearing sunglasses, made by designer Billy Stickles.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.black-network.com/charlesbio.htm |title=Blacknetwork.com |publisher=Blacknetwork.com |date= |accessdate=2010-09-10}}</ref>\n\nCharles had always played for other people, but he wanted his own band. He decided to leave Florida for a large city, but Chicago and New York City were too big.    After asking a friend to look at a map and note the city in the United States that was farthest from Florida, he moved to [[Seattle]] in 1947<ref name=\"boheme\">{{cite news|title=Charles, Ray (1930\u20132004)|publisher=HistoryLink url=http://www.historylink.org/essays/output.cfm?file_id=5707}}</ref> (where he first met and befriended, under the tutelage of [[Robert Blackwell]], a 14-year-old [[Quincy Jones]])<ref>[http://www.pbs.org/kcet/tavissmiley/archive/200701/20070116_jones.html Quincy Jones at www.pbs.org/...] Accessed 2010 May 9.</ref><ref>[http://www.achievement.org/autodoc/page/jon0bio-1 Quincy Jones at www.achievement.org/...] Accessed 2010 May 9.</ref> and soon started recording, first for the Down Beat label as the Maxin Trio with guitarist G.D. McKee and bassist Milton Garrett, achieving his first hit with \"[[Confession Blues]]\" in 1949. The song soared to No.2 on the R&B charts.\n\nIn 1950, he played in a Miami hotel, impressing [[Henry Stone]], who recorded a Ray Charles Rockin' record which never became very popular. During his stay in Miami, Charles was required to stay in the [[Racial segregation in the United States|segregated]] but thriving black community of [[Overtown (Miami)|Overtown]].

The following year, Swing Time folded and [[Ahmet Erteg\u00fcn]] signed him to [[Atlantic Records]].<ref name=\"boheme\" />\n\n===Atlantic Records===\nCharles' first recording session with Atlantic (\"The Midnight Hour\"/\"Roll With my Baby\") came in September 1952, although his last Swingtime release (\"Misery in my Heart\"/\"The Snow is Falling\") would not come until February 1953. He began recording [[jump blues]] and [[boogie-woogie]] style recordings as well as slower blues ballads where he continued to show the vocal influences of [[Nat King Cole|Nat \"King\" Cole]] and [[Charles Brown (musician)|Charles Brown]]. \"[[Mess Around]]\" became Charles' first Atlantic hit in 1953 and he later had hits the following year with \"[[It Should Have Been Me]]\" and \"Don't You Know\". He also recorded the songs, \"Midnight Hour\" and \"Sinner's Prayer\". Some elements of his own vocal style showed up in \"Sinner's Prayer\", \"Mess Around\" and \"Don't You Know\".\n\nLate in 1954, Charles recorded his own composition, \"[[I Got a Woman]]\", and the song became Charles' first number-one R&B hit in 1955 and brought him to national prominence.<ref>{{cite web|last=Dahl |first=Bill |url={{Allmusic|class=song|id=t2562634|pure_url=yes}} |title=profile |publisher=Allmusic.com |date=1954-11-18 |accessdate=2010-09-10}}</ref> The elements of \"I Got a Woman\" included a mixture of gospel, jazz and blues elements that would later prove to be seminal in the development of [[rock 'n' roll]] and [[soul music|soul]] music. He repeated this pattern throughout 1955 continuing through 1958 with records such as \"[[This Little Girl of Mine]]\", \"[[Drown in My Own Tears]]\", \"[[Lonely Avenue]]\", \"A Fool For You\" and \"[[Night Time Is the Right Time|The Night Time (Is the Right Time)]]\".\n\nWhile still promoting his R&B career, Charles also recorded instrumental jazz albums such as 1957's [[The Great Ray Charles]]. During this time, Charles also worked with jazz [[vibraphonist]] [[Milt Jackson]], releasing [[Soul Brothers]] in 1958 and [[Soul Meeting]] in 1961. By 1958, Charles was not only headlining black venues such as [[The Apollo Theater]] and [[Uptown Theater (Philadelphia)|The Uptown Theater]] but also bigger venues such as [[The Newport Jazz Festival]]. It was at the Newport festival where he cut his first live album. In 1956, Charles recruited a young all-[[girl group|female singing group]] named the Cookies, and reshaped them as [[The Raelettes]]. Before then, Charles had used his wife and other musicians to back him up on recordings such as \"This Little Girl of Mine\" and \"Drown In My Own Tears\". The Raelettes' first recording session with Charles was on the bluesy-gospel inflected \"Leave My Woman Alone\".\n\n===Crossover success===\n{{See also|What'd I Say (song)|Modern Sounds in Country and Western Music}}\n[[File:Ray Carles 260971neu000.jpg|thumb|right|Charles in 1971.

''The Genius of Ray Charles'' provided his first top 40 album entry where it peaked at No.&nbsp;17 and was later held as a landmark record in Charles' career but Charles saw a bigger opportunity following his Atlantic contract expiring in the fall of 1959 when several big labels offered him record deals.\n\nChoosing not to renegotiate his contract with Atlantic, Ray Charles signed with [[ABC Records|ABC-Paramount Records]] in November 1959, obtaining a much more liberal contract than other artists had at the time.<ref name=linernotes>[http://www.kalamu.com/bol/2007/08/12/ray-charles-%E2%80%9Ci-can%E2%80%99t-stop-loving-you%E2%80%9D/ breath of life \u00bb RAY CHARLES / \u201cI Can\u2019t Stop Loving You\u201d].

The case was eventually dropped, as the search lacked a proper [[Warrant (law)|warrant]] by the police, and Charles soon returned his focus on music and recording.<ref name=cooper20/>\n\nThe 1962 album, ''[[Modern Sounds in Country and Western Music]]'' and its sequel ''[[Modern Sounds in Country and Western Music Volume Two|Modern Sounds in Country and Western Music, Vol. 2]]'', helped to bring [[country music|country]] into the mainstream of music. His version of the Don Gibson song, ''[[I Can't Stop Loving You]]'' topped the Pop chart for five weeks and stayed at No.&nbsp;1 R&B for ten weeks in 1962.

With the rise of younger soul performers such as [[James Brown]], [[Otis Redding]] and Motown singers such as [[Smokey Robinson]], [[Marvin Gaye]] and its own blind artist, [[Stevie Wonder]], Charles' successes on the pop and R&B charts peaked after 1964 though he remained a huge concert draw.\n\nIn 1965, Charles' career halted after being arrested for a third time for heroin use.  He agreed to go to rehab to avoid [[jail]] time. Charles kicked his habit at a clinic in [[Los Angeles]]. After spending a year on [[parole]], Charles reemerged on the charts in 1966 with a series of hits composed with the fledgling team of [[Ashford & Simpson]] including the dance number, \"I Don't Need No Doctor\", \"Let's Go Get Stoned\", which became his first No.&nbsp;1 R&B hit in several years, and \"[[Crying Time]]\", which reached No.&nbsp;6 on the pop chart and later helped Charles win a Grammy Award the following March.

The rise of [[psychedelic rock]] and harder forms of rock and R&B music reduced Charles' radio appeal, as did his choosing to record pop standards and covers of then-modern day rock and soul hits\u2014his earnings from owning his own masters taking away motivation to write new material. Most of his recordings between 1968 and 1973 evoked strong reactions\u2014people either liked them a lot or disliked them a lot.<ref name=\"boheme\"/> Nonetheless, Charles continued to have an active recording career. Charles' 1972 album, ''Message from the People'', included his unique gospel-influenced version of \"[[America the Beautiful]]\". In 1974, he left ABC Records and recorded several albums on his own Crossover Records label. His 1975 recording of Stevie Wonder's hit, \"[[Living for the City]]\" later helped Charles win another Grammy.\n\nIn 1977, he reunited with Ahmet Ertegun and re-signed to Atlantic Records where he recorded the album, ''[[True to Life]]''. However, the label had now begun focusing on rock acts and some of the label's prominent soul artists such as [[Aretha Franklin]] were starting to be neglected. Charles stayed with his old label until 1980.

However, he cancelled after learning from students of [[Paine College]] that the larger auditorium dance floor would be restricted to whites, while blacks would be obligated to sit in the Music Hall balcony; he immediately left town after letting the public know why he wouldn't be performing. The promoter sued Charles for breach of contract, Charles was fined $757 in Fulton County Superior Court in Atlanta on June 14, 1962. Although the 2004 film ''[[Ray (film)|Ray]]'' portrays Charles as being banned from performing thereafter in Georgia, this was later reported to be untrue.<ref>{{cite web|work=AtlantaMagazine.com|url=http://www.atlantamagazine.com/flashback/Story.aspx?id=1372656|title=32 Years Ago This Month: Ray Charles Serenades the Legislature|accessdate=January 18, 2013}}</ref>  However, Charles performed again at a desegregrated Bell Auditorium concert the following year with his backup group, [[The Raelettes]], on October 23, 1963.<ref>{{cite web|work=augustaciviccenter.com|url=http://augustaciviccenter.com/auditorium.html|title= William B.

His long-term girlfriend and partner at the time of his death was Norma Pinella. His first child, Evelyn, was born in 1950 to girlfriend, Louise Mitchell. His three children with Della, Ray Charles, Jr., David and Robert, were born in 1955, 1958 and 1960, respectively. Another son, Charles Wayne, was born in 1959 during his six-year-long affair with original [[Raelettes]] vocalist, Margie Hendricks. In 1961 a daughter, Raenee, was born during an affair with Mae Mosely Lyles. Two years later in 1963 Charles and Sandra Jean Betts welcomed daughter, Sheila Raye Charles Robinson. In 1966 a daughter, Alicia, was born by a woman who remains unidentified to this day, followed by another daughter, Alexandra, born to a woman named Chantal Bertrand.

In the words of musicologist Henry Pleasants:\n\n<blockquote>[[Sinatra]], and [[Bing Crosby]] before him, had been masters of words. Ray Charles is a master of sounds. His records disclose an extraordinary assortment of slurs, glides, turns, shrieks, wails, breaks, shouts, screams and hollers, all wonderfully controlled, disciplined by inspired musicianship, and harnessed to ingenious subtleties of harmony, dynamics and rhythm... It is either the singing of a man whose vocabulary is inadequate to express what is in his heart and mind or of one whose feelings are too intense for satisfactory verbal or conventionally melodic articulation. He can\u2019t tell it to you. He can\u2019t even sing it to you. He has to cry out to you, or shout to you, in tones eloquent of despair \u2014 or exaltation. The voice alone, with little assistance from the text or the notated music, conveys the message.</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>Ray Charles is usually described as a [[baritone]], and his speaking voice would suggest as much, as would the difficulty he experiences in reaching and sustaining the baritone's high E and F in a popular ballad. But the voice undergoes some sort of transfiguration under stress, and in music of gospel or blues character he can and does sing for measures on end in the high tenor range of A, B flat, B, C and even in full voice, sometimes in an ecstatic head voice, sometimes in [[falsetto]]. In falsetto he continues up to E and F above high C. On one extraordinary record, \"I\u2019m Going Down to the River\" . . . he hits an incredible B flat . . .  giving him an overall range, including the falsetto extension, of at least three octaves.<ref>Pleasants, H. (1974). ''The Great American Popular Singers.''
