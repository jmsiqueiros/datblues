Born in [[Bentonia, Mississippi|Bentonia]], [[Mississippi]], United States, he died in [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]].\n\nHe first learned to play guitar from another bluesman from the area, Henry Stuckey. His guitar playing is noted for its dark, [[Minor key|minor]] sound, played in an open D-minor tuning with an intricate [[Fingerstyle|fingerpicking]] technique. James first recorded for [[Paramount Records]] in 1931, but these recordings sold poorly due to the [[Great Depression]], and he drifted into obscurity. After a long absence from the public eye, James was \"rediscovered\" in 1964 by three blues enthusiasts, helping further the [[American folk music revival|blues and folk music revival]] of the 1950s and early 1960s. During this period, James appeared at several folk and blues festivals and gave live concerts around the country, also recording several albums for various [[record label]]s.\n\nHis songs have influenced several generations of musicians, being adapted or covered by [[Kansas Joe McCoy]], [[Robert Johnson (musician)|Robert Johnson]], [[Alan Wilson (musician)|Alan Wilson]], [[Cream (band)|Cream]], [[Deep Purple]], [[Chris Thomas King]], [[Alvin Youngblood Hart]], [[The Derek Trucks Band]], [[Beck]], [[Big Sugar]], [[Eric Clapton]], [[Lucinda Williams]] and [[Rory Block]]. He is hailed as \"one of the seminal figures of the blues.\"<ref name=latimes>{{cite web|url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/413213341.html?dids=413213341:413213341&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Sep+28%2C+2003&author=Richard+Cromelin&pub=Los+Angeles+Times&desc=TELEVISION%3B+%27Blues%27+out+of+rhythm%3B+Infinitely+rich+subject+matter+suffers+from+a+lack+of+a+thematic+line+in+the+hands+of+seven+directors+--+though+Wim+Wenders+gets+it+right.&pqatl=google |title=TELEVISION; 'Blues' out of rhythm; Infinitely rich subject matter suffers from a lack of a thematic line in the hands of seven directors - though Wim Wenders gets it right |publisher=Pqasb.pqarchiver.com |date=2003-09-28 |accessdate=2011-12-30}}</ref>\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early years===\nJames was born near Bentonia, Mississippi.<ref name=\"AMG\"/>  His father was a converted [[rum-running|bootlegger]] turned [[preacher]].<ref name=\"russell\">{{cite book\n| first= Tony\n| last= Russell\n| year= 1997\n| title= The Blues - From [[Robert Johnson (musician)|Robert Johnson]] to [[Robert Cray]]\n| edition=\n| publisher=Carlton Books Limited\n| location= Dubai\n| page= 123\n| isbn= 1-85868-255-X}}</ref> As a youth, James heard local musicians such as Henry Stuckey and brothers Charlie and Jesse Sims and began playing the organ in his teens. He worked on road construction and [[levee]]-building crews in his native Mississippi in the early 1920s, and wrote what is perhaps his earliest song, \"Illinois Blues\", about his experiences as a laborer.\n\nHe began playing guitar in [[D Minor|open D-minor tuning]]<ref>{{cite book|last=Calt|first=Stephen|title=I'd rather be the devil: Skip James and the blues|year=2008|publisher=Chicago Review Press|location=Chicago|isbn=9781569769980|page=88|quote=\"The product of this desire, he said, was his basic guitar tuning, open D minor...\"}}</ref>\n\n===1920s and 1930s===\nIn early 1931, James auditioned for [[Jackson, Mississippi]], [[record shop]] owner and [[talent scout]] [[H. C. Speir]], who placed blues performers with a variety of [[record label]]s including [[Paramount Records]].<ref name=\"russell\"/>  On the strength of this audition, James traveled to [[Grafton, Wisconsin|Grafton]], [[Wisconsin]] to [[sound recording and reproduction|record]] for Paramount.<ref name=\"russell\"/> James's 1931 work is considered idiosyncratic among pre-[[World War II|war]] blues recordings, and formed the basis of his reputation as a musician.\n\nAs is typical of his era, James recorded a variety of material \u2014 blues and [[Spiritual (music)|spirituals]], [[cover version]]s and original compositions \u2014 frequently blurring the lines between genres and sources. For example, \"I'm So Glad\" was derived from a 1927 song by Art Sizemore and George A. Little entitled \"So Tired\", which had been recorded in 1928 by both [[Gene Austin]] and [[Lonnie Johnson (musician)|Lonnie Johnson]] (the latter under the title \"I'm So Tired of Livin' All Alone\"). Biographer Stephen Calt, echoing the opinion of several [[music journalism|critics]], considered the finished product totally original, \"one of the most extraordinary examples of fingerpicking found in guitar music\".<ref name=\"Calt\" />\n\nSeveral of the Grafton recordings, such as \"Hard Time Killing Floor Blues\", \"Devil Got My Woman\", \"Jesus Is A Mighty Good Leader\", and \"22-20 Blues\" (the basis for [[Robert Johnson (musician)|Robert Johnson]]'s better-known \"[[32-20 Blues]]\", and the band name for the English group [[22-20s]]), have proven similarly influential. Very few original copies of James's Paramount 78 [[RPM]]s have survived.\n\nThe Great Depression struck just as James' recordings were hitting the market. Sales were poor as a result, and James gave up performing the blues to become the choir director in his father's church.<ref name=\"russell\"/> James himself was later ordained as a minister in both the [[Baptist]] and [[Methodist]] denominations, but the extent of his involvement in religious activities is unknown.<ref name=\"russell\"/>\n\n===Disappearance, rediscovery, and legacy===\nFor the next thirty years, James recorded nothing and drifted in and out of music. He was virtually unknown to listeners until about 1960. In 1964 blues enthusiasts [[John Fahey (musician)|John Fahey]], [[Bill Barth]], and [[Henry Vestine]] found him in a hospital in [[Tunica, Mississippi]]. According to Calt, the \"rediscovery\" of both James and of [[Son House]] at virtually the same moment was the start of the \"blues revival\" in the US.<ref name=\"Calt\">{{cite book| last = Calt | first = Stephen | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = I'd Rather Be the Devil: Skip James and the blues| publisher = Da Capo Press| year = 1994| location = | pages =| url =  | doi = | id = | isbn = 978-0-306-80579-0}}</ref>  In July 1964 James, along with other rediscovered performers, appeared at the [[Newport Folk Festival]].<ref name=\"russell\"/> Several [[photography|photographs]] by [[Dick Waterman]] captured this first performance in over 30 years. Throughout the remainder of the decade, he recorded for the [[Takoma Records|Takoma]], [[Melodeon Records|Melodeon]], and [[Vanguard Records|Vanguard]] labels and played various engagements until his death in Philadelphia from [[cancer]] in 1969.<ref name=\"russell\"/><ref name=\"Dead\">{{cite web|author=Doc Rock |url=http://thedeadrockstarsclub.com/1960.html |title=The 1960s |publisher=The Dead Rock Stars Club |date= |accessdate=2014-01-29}}</ref>\n\nAlthough James was not initially [[cover version|covered]] as frequently as other rediscovered musicians, British rock band [[Cream (band)|Cream]] recorded \"I'm So Glad\"<ref name=latimes/> (a [[Fresh Cream|studio]] version and a [[Goodbye (Cream album)|live]] version), providing James with the only windfall of his career.<ref name=\"AMG\"/> [[Deep Purple]] also covered \"I'm So Glad,\" on ''[[Shades of Deep Purple]]'', and English [[blues rock]] band [[22-20s]] named themselves after \"22-20 Blues.\"<ref>[http://www.rock-city.co.uk/content/EpyykkkypuHSkDwAVm.shtml ]{{dead link|date=January 2014}}</ref>\n\nSince his death, James's music has become more available and prevalent than during his lifetime \u2014 his 1931 recordings, along with several rediscovery recordings and concerts, have found their way onto numerous [[compact disc]]s, drifting in and out of print. His influence is still felt among contemporary bluesmen.  Gregg Allman recorded 'Devil Got My Woman' on his 2011 \"Low Country Blues\". James also left a mark on [[Hollywood, California|Hollywood]], as well, with [[Chris Thomas King]]'s cover of \"Hard Time Killing Floor Blues\" on ''[[O Brother, Where Art Thou?]]'', and the 1931 \"Devil Got My Woman\" featured in the plot and [[soundtrack]] of ''[[Ghost World (film)|Ghost World]]''. In recent times, British post-rock band [[Hope of the States]] released a song partially focused on the life of Skip James entitled \"Nehemiah\", which charted at number 30 in the [[UK Singles Chart]].<ref name=\"British Hit Singles & Albums\">{{cite book\n| first= David\n| last= Roberts\n| year= 2006\n| title= British Hit Singles & Albums\n| edition= 19th\n| publisher= Guinness World Records Limited\n| location= London\n| page= 259\n| isbn= 1-904994-10-5}}</ref>  \"He's a Mighty Good Leader\" was also covered by [[Beck]] on his 1994 album ''[[One Foot in the Grave (album)|One Foot in the Grave]]''.\n\n===Personality===\nJames was known to be an aloof and moody person.<ref name=dahl>Dahl, Bill. Liner notes to ''D. C. Blues: The Library of Congress Recordings, Vol. 1''. [[Fuel 2000 Records]], CD, 1997</ref> \"Skip James, you never knew. Skip could be sunshine, or thunder and lightning depending on his whim of the moment\" commented [[Richard K. Spottswood|Dick Spottswood]] on James's personality.<ref name=dahl/>\n\n==Musical style==\n\n===James as guitarist===\nJames often played his guitar with an open D-minor tuning (D-A-D-F-A-D), resulting in the \"deep\" sound of the 1931 recordings. James purportedly learned this tuning from his musical mentor, the unrecorded bluesman Henry Stuckey. {{citation needed|date=November 2009}} Stuckey in turn was said to have acquired it from Bahamanian soldiers during the [[World War I|First World War]],{{citation needed|date=November 2009}} despite the fact that his service card shows he didn't serve overseas. Robert Johnson also recorded in this tuning, his \"Hell Hound On My Trail\" being based on James' \"Devil Got My Woman.\"<ref name=\"AMG\"/> James' classically-informed, finger-picking style was fast and clean, using the entire register of the guitar with heavy, hypnotic bass lines. {{citation needed|date=November 2009}} James' style of playing had more in common with the [[Piedmont blues]] of the East Coast than with the [[Delta blues]] of his native Mississippi.{{citation needed|date=May 2009}}\n\n===The \"Bentonia School\"===\nJames is sometimes associated with the [[Bentonia School (blues)|Bentonia School]], which is either a sub-genre of blues music or a style of playing it.<ref name=\"AMG\"/> Calt, in his 1994 [[biography]] of James, ''I'd Rather Be the Devil: Skip James and the Blues'', maintains that there was indeed no style of blues that originated in Bentonia, and that this is simply a notion of later blues writers who overestimated the provinciality of Mississippi during the early 20th century, when railways linked small towns, and who failed to see that in the case of [[Jack Owens (blues singer)|Jack Owens]], \"the 'tradition' he bore primarily consisted of musical scraps from James' table\". Owens and other musicians who may have been contemporaries of James were not recorded until the 1960s revival period. As such, the extent to which the work of said musicians is indicative of any \"school\", and whether James originated it or was simply a \"member\", remains an open question.<ref name=\"AMG\"/>\n\n==Discography==\n'''Paramount 78s: 1931'''\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- \"\n! style=\"width:300px;\"| A-side\n! style=\"width:300px;\"| B-side\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| \"Cherry Ball Blues\"\n||\"Hard Time Killing Floor Blues\"\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| \"22-20 Blues\"\n|| \"If You Haven't Any Hay Get on Down the Road\"\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| \"Crow Jane\"\n|| \"Yola My Blues Away\"\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| \"How Long 'Buck'\"\n|| \"Little Cow and Calf Is Gonna Die Blues\"\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| \"Devil Got My Woman\"\n|| \"Cypress Grove Blues\"\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| \"I'm So Glad\"\n|| \"Special Rider Blues\"\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| \"Four O'Clock Blues\"\n|| \"Hard Luck Child\"\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| \"Jesus Is a Mighty Good Leader\"\n|| \"Be Ready When He Comes\"\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| \"Drunken Spree\"\n|| \"What Am I to Do\"\n|}\n\n===Rediscovery: 1964\u20131969===\nJames, despite poor health, recorded several LPs worth of music, mostly revisiting his 1931 sides, traditional music, and spirituals; but along with these, he sang a handful of newly penned blues meditating on his illness and convalescence. These five prolific years have not been thoroughly documented: recordings, outtakes, and interviews not released on James's few proper LPs (which, themselves, have been endlessly cannibalized and reissued) are scattered among many small label compilations. Previously unreleased performances continue to be found, released, and left largely unexplained\u2014sometimes hours' worth at a time.
