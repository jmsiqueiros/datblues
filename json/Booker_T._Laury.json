Laury''' (September 2, 1914 &ndash; September 23, 1995) was an [[United States|American]] [[boogie-woogie]], [[blues]], [[Gospel (music)|gospel]] and [[jazz]] [[pianist]] and [[singing|singer]].<ref name=\"AMG\"/> Over his lengthy career, Laury worked with various [[musician]]s including [[Memphis Slim]] and [[Mose Vinson]]. He appeared in two films, but did not record his debut album until he was almost eighty years of age.<ref name=\"Jazz\"/><ref name=\"IMDb\"/>\n\n==Biography==\n'''Lawrence Laury''' was born in [[Memphis]], [[Tennessee]], and grew up with his lifelong friend, [[Memphis Slim]].<ref name=\"AMG\"/> At the age of six, after helping his mother play the family's [[Reed organ|pump organ]], Laury learned to play the [[Keyboard instrument|keyboards]].  His [[Jazz|barrelhouse]] playing style, which he developed alongside Slim, was based on the influence gained from regular Memphis performers [[Roosevelt Sykes]], [[Sunnyland Slim]], and [[Speckled Red]].  In the early 1930s, and in the company of the younger [[Mose Vinson]], Slim and Laury began playing in local clubs.<ref name=\"Jazz\"/>\n\nIn 1935, Sykes suggested to Laury and Slim that they relocated to [[Chicago]], with a view of obtaining a [[recording contract]].  Slim took up the advice, but Laury decided to remain in Memphis, where he played in gambling houses and clubs for decades. Laury had a large hand-width, which enabled him to span ten keys. His playing dexterity was such that, after losing one finger on his left hand following an accident with a [[circular saw]] in the 1950s, he was still able to play well. Based around Memphis' [[Beale Street]], as that area started to degenerate, Laury traveled around [[Tennessee]], [[Arkansas]] and [[Missouri]]. Despite differing fortunes, the friendship with Slim did not diminish over the years, up to Slim's death in 1988.<ref name=\"Jazz\"/>\n\nIn the 1989 [[Dennis Quaid]] [[film]], ''[[Great Balls of Fire! (film)|Great Balls of Fire!]]'', the plot had a young [[Jerry Lee Lewis]] and [[Jimmy Swaggart]], look into a [[juke joint]] to see Laury playing \"Big Legged Woman\".  This attention led to Laury having the opportunity to record later in his life.<ref name=\"Jazz\">{{cite web |url=http://www.allaboutjazz.com/php/musician.php?id=8608 |title=Booker T.
