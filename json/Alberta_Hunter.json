Her career had started back in the early 1920s, and from there on, she became a successful jazz and [[blues]] recording artist, being critically acclaimed to the ranks of [[Ethel Waters]] and [[Bessie Smith]].  In the 1950s, she retired from performing and entered the medical field, only to successfully resume her singing career in her 80s.\n\n==1910s \u2013 1940s==\nBorn in [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]],<ref name=\"amg\"/> she left home while still in her early teens and settled in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]].<ref>[http://www.femmenoir.net/new/content/view/227/153/ Femmenoir website \u2013 January 2008]</ref> There, she peeled potatoes by day and hounded club owners by night, determined to land a singing job. Her persistence paid off, and Hunter began a climb through some of the city's lowest dives to a headlining job at its most prestigious venue for black entertainers, the Dreamland ballroom. She had a five-year association with the Dreamland, beginning in 1917, and her salary rose to $35 a week.<ref name= barlow>Barlow, William. ''\"Looking Up At Down\": The Emergence of Blues Culture''.

The Europeans treated her as an artist, showing her respect and even reverence, which made a great impression on her.<ref name=barlow/>\n\nHer career as singer and songwriter flourished in the 1920s and 1930s, and she appeared in clubs and on stage in musicals in both [[New York City|New York]] and [[London]]. The songs she wrote include the critically acclaimed \"[[Downhearted Blues]]\" (1922). She recorded several records with [[Perry Bradford]] from 1922 to 1927.\n\nHunter recorded prolifically during the 1920s, starting with sessions for [[Black Swan Records|Black Swan]] in 1921, [[Paramount Records|Paramount]] in 1922\u20131924, [[Gennett Records|Gennett]] in 1924, [[OKeh Records|OKeh]] in 1925\u20131926, [[Victor Records|Victor]] in 1927 and [[Columbia Records|Columbia]] in 1929.\n\nHunter wrote \"Downhearted Blues\" while recording for [[J. Mayo Williams|Ink Williams]] at [[Paramount Records]], but she received only $368 in [[royalties]].  Williams secretly sold the recording rights to [[Columbia Records]], in a deal giving the royalties to Williams. The song became a big hit for Columbia, with Bessie Smith as the vocalist.  Hunter learned what Williams had done and stopped recording for him.<ref name=barlow/>\n[[File:Chirpin the blues.ogg|right]]\nIn 1928, Hunter played \"Queenie\" opposite [[Paul Robeson]] in the first London production of ''[[Show Boat]]'' at [[Drury Lane]].  She subsequently performed in [[nightclub]]s throughout [[Europe]] and appeared for the 1934 winter season with [[Jack Jackson (British radio)|Jack Jackson]]'s society [[orchestra]] at London's [[Dorchester Hotel]]. One of her recordings with Jackson is Miss Otis Regrets (she is unable to Lunch Today).<ref name=\"russell\">{{cite book\n| first= Tony\n| last= Russell\n| year= 1996\n| title= The Blues: From Robert Johnson to Robert Cray\n| edition=\n| publisher= Carlton Books Limited\n| location= Dubai\n| pages= 120\u201321\n| isbn= 1-85868-255-X}}</ref>\nWhile at the Dorchester, she made several [[HMV]] [[sound recording and reproduction|recordings]] with the orchestra and appeared in ''Radio Parade of 1935'' (1934),<ref name=\"russell\"/> the first British theatrical [[film]] to feature the short-lived [[Dufaycolor]], but only Hunter's segment was in color. She spent the late 1930s fulfilling engagements on both sides of the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] and the early 1940s performing at home. In 1944, she took a [[U.S.O.]] troupe to [[Casablanca]] and continued entertaining troops in both theatres of war for the duration of [[World War II]] and into the early postwar period.<ref name=\"russell\"/> In the 1950s, she led U.S.O. troupes in [[Korea]], but her mother's death in 1954 led her to her seek a radical career change. She prudently reduced her age, \"invented\" a [[high school diploma]], and enrolled in [[nursing school]], embarking on what was apparently a fulfilling career in [[healthcare]].\n\n==1970s==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2011}}\nHunter was working at [[New York City|New York]]'s Goldwater Memorial Hospital in 1961 when [[record producer]] [[Chris Albertson]] asked her to break an 11-year absence from the [[recording studio]]. The result was her participation (four songs) on a Prestige [[Bluesville Records]] [[album]], entitled ''Songs We Taught Your Mother.''  The following month, Albertson recorded her again, this time for the [[Riverside Records]] label, reuniting her with [[Lil Armstrong]] and [[Lovie Austin]], both of whom she had performed with in the 1920s. Hunter enjoyed these outings, but had no plans to return to singing. She was prepared to devote the rest of her life to nursing, but the hospital retired her in 1977, when they believed her to have reached [[retirement age]] (she was aged over 80).\n\nBored by inactivity, Hunter decided to resume her singing career, because she \"never felt better.\" In 1978, at the suggestion of [[Charles Bourgeois]], restaurateur Barney Josephson offered Hunter a limited engagement at his [[Greenwich Village]] club, The Cookery. She accepted and a two-week gig proved a smash when the comeback garnered generous [[News media|media]] attention and people started flocking into The Cookery.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}\n\nImpressed with the attention paid her by the press, [[John H. Hammond|John Hammond]] signed Hunter to [[Columbia Records]]. He had not previously shown interest in Hunter, but he had been a close associate of Barney Josephson decades earlier, when the latter ran the [[Caf\u00e9 Society]] Uptown and Downtown clubs. Her Columbia albums, ''The Glory of Alberta Hunter,'' ''Amtrak Blues,'' (where she sang the jazz classic \"The Darktown Strutters' Ball\"), and ''Look For the Silver Lining'', did not do as well as expected, but sales were nevertheless healthy. There were also numerous [[television]] appearances, including on ''[[To Tell The Truth]]'' (in which panelist [[Kitty Carlisle]] had to recuse herself, the two having known each other in Hunter's heyday). There was also a walk-on role in ''[[Remember My Name(film)|Remember My Name]]'', a film produced by [[film director]] [[Robert Altman]], for which he commissioned her to write and to perform the [[soundtrack]] music. As capacity audiences continued to fill The Cookery nightly, [[concert]] offers came from [[Brazil]] to [[Berlin]], and there was an invitation for her to sing at the [[White House]]. At first, she turned it down, because, she explained, \"they wanted me there on my day off,\" but the White House amended its schedule to suit the veteran artist. During that time, there was also a visit from former [[First Lady]] turned [[book editor]] [[Jackie Onassis]], who wanted to sign her up for an [[autobiography]] but was unhappy with the co-author assigned to the project. The book was eventually done for another [[publisher]], with the help of writer Frank Taylor.\n\nThe comeback lasted six years, and Hunter toured in Europe and [[South America]], made more television appearances, and enjoyed her renewed recording career as well as the fact that record catalogs now once again contained her old recordings, going back to her 1921 debut on the Black Swan label.\n\n==Personal life==\nHunter's life was documented in ''Alberta Hunter: My Castle's Rockin''' (1998), a [[Documentary film|documentary]] written by Chris Albertson and narrated by pianist Billy Taylor, and in ''Cookin' at the Cookery,'' a [[biography|biographical]] [[musical theater|musical]] by Marion J. Caffey that has toured the United States in recent years with [[Ernestine Jackson]] as Hunter.\n\nHunter came from a difficult background. Her father left when she was a child and to support the family Hunter\u2019s mother worked as a servant to a whorehouse in Memphis. Although she married again in 1906, Hunter was not happy with her new family.  Hunter left for Chicago around the age of eleven, in the hopes of becoming a paid singer; she had heard that it paid ten dollars an hour. Instead of finding a job as a singer she had to earn money by working at a boardinghouse that paid six dollars a week as well as room and board. Hunter's mother left Memphis and moved in with her soon afterwards.<ref name='EBSCOhost 2010-02-15'>{{cite encyclopedia |last= |first= |author= |authorlink= |coauthors= |editor= |encyclopedia=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica |title=Hunter, Alberta |url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=mih&AN=32413464&site=ehost-live |accessdate=2010-02-15 |edition= |date= |year=2008 |publisher= |volume= |location= |id= |doi= |pages=1\u20132 |quote= }}</ref>\n\nHunter was a lesbian, though she kept her sexuality relatively private. Her 1919 marriage to Willard Saxby Townsend was short-lived. In August 1927, she  sailed for France, accompanied by Lottie Tyler, a New York lady whom she had met in Chicago a few years earlier. Their relationship lasted until Ms. Tyler's death, many years later.<ref>Edkins, Diana and Carole Marks. ''The Power of Pride: Stylemakers and Rulebreakers of the Harlem Renaissance''. Crown Publishers, Inc. New York. 1999</ref>\n\nHunter eventually moved to New York City. She performed with [[Bricktop]] and recorded with [[Louis Armstrong]] and [[Sidney Bechet]]. She continued to perform on both sides of the Atlantic, and as the head of the USO's first black show, until her mother's death, 1954. That year, she gave up show business and became a registered nurse. When Roosevelt Island's Goldwater Memorial Hospital retired her, believing her to have reached that age, Alberts (who was actually several years older) decided to return to singing. Ahe had already made a brief return by appearing on two record albums, but now she too a regular engagement at a Greenvich Village club, becoming a huge attraction there until her death in October 1984. She is buried in the Ferncliff Cemetery and Mausoleum, [[Hartsdale, New York|Hartsdale]], [[Westchester County]], [[New York]] (Elmwood section; plot 1411).<ref>[http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&GSln=hunter&GSfn=alberta&GSbyrel=all&GSdyrel=all&GSob=n&GRid=2983& Find a Grave website \u2013 accessed January 2008]</ref>\n\nHunter was inducted to the [[Blues Hall of Fame]] in 2011, while her album ''Amtrak Blues'' had been previously honored in 2009.<ref>http://www.blues.org/halloffame/#ref=halloffame_inductees</ref>\n\n==Discography==\n\n===Studio albums===\n* 1978:  ''Remember My Name'' (Columbia)\n* 1980:  ''Amtrak Blues'' (Columbia)\n* 1982:  ''The Glory of Alberta Hunter'' (Columbia)\n* 1983:  ''Look for the Silver Lining'' (Columbia)\n\n===Live album===\n* 2001:  ''Downhearted Blues: Live at the Cookery'' (Varese)\n\n===Collaborative albums===\n* 1961:  ''Chicago: The Living Legends'' (Riverside) (with [[Lovie Austin]]'s Blues Serenaders)\n* 1961:  ''Songs We Taught Your Mother'' (with [[Victoria Spivey]] and [[Lucille Hegamin]]) (Bluesville/Original Blues Classics)\n\n===Compilation===\n* 1996:  ''Complete Recorded Works Vols.
