The track, re-titled \"Grits Ain't Groceries,\" was [[cover version|covered]] by [[Little Milton]].<ref name=\"AMG\"/>\n\nTurner and John then co-wrote \"[[Leave My Kitten Alone]]\", later covered by [[Johnny Preston]], [[The Beatles]] and [[Elvis Costello]]. In 1959  the [[King Records (USA)|King]] [[record label|label]] issued Turner's first [[hit single]], \"The Return of Stagolee,\" an [[answer song]] to  [[Lloyd Price]]'s \"[[Stagger Lee (song)|Stagger Lee]]\". He repeated the trick with his next release, \"We Told You Not To Marry,\" an antidote to  Price's \"[[I'm Gonna Get Married]].\" In 1960, [[Ray Charles]] recorded the Turner song, \"Sticks and Stones\", which has also seen many cover versions over the years.  By 1961 Turner had his biggest solo success with \"Sound-Off,\" which came from the only [[album]] he ever released.<ref name=\"AMG\"/> The track was described by [[Joel Whitburn]] in ''Top Pop Singles 1955-2002'' as a \"popular [[United States Army|US Army]] [[Military cadence|marching drill chant]],\" which was originally a no. 3 hit for [[Vaughn Monroe]] in 1951.<ref name=\"Billboard\"/>\n\nLater singles failed to find a market, and Turner recorded for a plethora of labels throughout the 1960s without further tangible success.<ref name=\"AMG\"/> These included \"Eye to Eye\" (Okeh, 1966).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.georgwa.demon.co.uk/okeh_singles.htm |title=Okeh Singles Listing From 1963-1970 |publisher=Georgwa.demon.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2014-01-31}}</ref> In 1969 his self-penned track \"His Funeral, My Trial\" was his final release.<ref name=\"AMG\"/> \n\nTurner died in Atlanta in 1984.<ref name=\"AMG\"/>\n\n==Notable songwriting credits==\n*\"All Around the World\" - also known as \"Grits Ain't Groceries\" (Turner)\n*\"Big John\" (Turner)\n*\"Get on the Right Track Baby\" (Turner)\n*\"Hey Doll Baby\" ([[Traditional music|Traditional]]/Turner)\n*\"Hold Your Loving\" (Bernice Snelson, Turner)\n*\"If It's Good\" ([[Julia Lee (musician)|Julia Lee]]/Turner)\n*\"[[Leave My Kitten Alone]]\" ([[Little Willie John]]/James McDougal/Turner)\n*\"Little Girl Lost\" ([[Luther Dixon]]/[[Lou Harrison]]/Turner)\n*\"Living in Misery\" (Turner)\n*\"Lotus Blossom\" ([[Julia Lee (musician)|Julia Lee]]/Turner)\n*\"People Sure Act Funny\" ([[Bobby Robinson (record producer)|Bobby Robinson]]/Turner)\n*\"Soulville\" ([[Henry Glover]]/[[Morris Levy]]/[[Dinah Washington]]/Turner)\n*\"[[Sticks and Stones (Titus Turner song)|Sticks and Stones]]\" (Turner)\n*\"Stop The Pain\" (Turner)\n*\"Tell It Like It Is\" (Turner)\n*\"[[Tell Me Why (1956 song)|Tell Me Why]]\" (Turner)<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/titus-turner-mn0000931567/songs |title=Titus Turner &#124; Songs |publisher=AllMusic |date= |accessdate=2014-01-31}}</ref>\n\n==Discography==\n===Albums===\n*''Sound Off'' (1961) - [[Jamie Records|Jamie]]<ref name=\"allmusic1\">{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/titus-turner-mn0000931567/discography/all |title=Titus Turner &#124; Discography |publisher=AllMusic |date= |accessdate=2014-01-31}}</ref>\n\n===Compilation albums===\n*''Soulville: Golden Classics'' (1990) - Collectables Records\n*''Sound Off: The Jamie Masters'' (1994) - Bear Family\n*''Titans of R&B'' (1998) - Red Lightnin' ([[United Kingdom|UK]])\n*''1949-1954'' (2005) - Classics R&B<ref name=\"allmusic1\"/>\n\n===Chart singles===\n*\"Return of Stagolee\" ([[King Records (USA)|King 5186]]) (April 1959) - [[United States|US]] [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs|R&B]] no. 29\n*\"We Told You Not To Marry\" (Glover 201) (December 1959) - US [[Billboard Hot 100|Pop]] no. 83\n*\"Sound-Off\" ([[Jamie Records|Jamie 1174]]) (March 1961) - US Pop no. 77<ref name=\"Billboard\">{{cite book\n| first=Joel\n| last= Whitburn\n| year= \n| title= Top Pop Singles 1955-2002\n| edition= \n| publisher= Billboard \n| location= \n| isbn= 0-89820-155-1\n| page= }}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of East Coast blues musicians]]\n*[[List of jump blues musicians]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.soulfulkindamusic.net/tturner.htm Comprehensive singles discography at Soulfulkindamusic.net]\n\n{{Authority control|VIAF=7654076}}\n{{Persondata <!-- Metadata: see [[Wikipedia:Persondata]]. -->\n| NAME              = Turner, Titus\n| ALTERNATIVE NAMES = \n| SHORT DESCRIPTION = [[United States|American]] [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]] and [[East Coast blues]] singer and songwriter\n| DATE OF BIRTH     = May 1, 1933\n| PLACE OF BIRTH    = [[Atlanta, Georgia]], United States\n| DATE OF DEATH     = September 13, 1984\n| PLACE OF DEATH    = Atlanta, Georgia, United States\n}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Turner, Titus}}\n[[Category:1933 births]]\n[[Category:1984 deaths]]\n[[Category:American blues musicians]]\n[[Category:American blues singers]]\n[[Category:American male singers]]\n[[Category:American rhythm and blues musicians]]\n[[Category:American rhythm and blues singers]]\n[[Category:Songwriters from Georgia (U.S. state)]]\n[[Category:East Coast blues musicians]]\n[[Category:Jump blues musicians]]\n[[Category:Musicians from Atlanta, Georgia]]\n[[Category:Writers from Atlanta, Georgia]]"}]}}}}
