He was self-taught in the harmonica and made his first [[guitar]].<ref name=\"Encyc\"/>\n\nInitially influenced by exposure to the music of [[Sonny Boy Williamson I]] and [[Big Bill Broonzy]], Burns relocated from the [[Mississippi delta]] via [[Waterloo, Iowa|Waterloo]], [[Iowa]] to [[Detroit]] in 1948.<ref name=\"Encyc\"/> Originally Burns excelled playing the harmonica, and his debut [[single (music)|single]], \"Notoriety Woman\" (1948), featured this ability accompanied by the guitar playing of John T. Smith. Burns tells how he met John Lee Hooker here: \"Well see, John T. and me was playing at a house party this particular Saturday night.  We was in Detroit Black Bottom...so Hooker was on his way home from somewhere - I guess he was at some other party, house parties used to be real plentiful here.  Hooker heard it, knocked at the door, and they let him in.  He introduced himself and he sat down and played some with us.  And then, he liked the way I was blowing harmonica...he had a session coming up on Tuesday, this was on a Saturday.  And so then, he wanted to know if I wanted to do this session with him on Tuesday.  And I told him, yes, naturally.  So that's how John T. and me went down to cut for Hooker.  When we got through the man wanted to know what I had.  I had one song, \"Notoriety Woman.\" And so he said I'd need two, and I sat there and made up \"Papa's Boogie.\"\" <ref>Blue Suit Records, \"Detroit\" liner notes, 1989</ref> However, by the following year Burns was playing guitar accompaniment on [[sound recording and reproduction|recordings]] by [[John Lee Hooker]].<ref name=\"AMG\"/> \n\nBilled at times as Big Daddy, Little Eddie, or Big Ed, Burns performed regularly in Detroit [[nightclub]]s, but had to supplement his earnings by working as a [[mechanic]].<ref name=\"Encyc\"/> In those early years Burns's own recording was not prolific with just a handful of tracks released on several [[record label|labels]].  His output veered from Detroit blues to [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]] as the 1960s progressed, when he issued a number of singles in that decade on [[Harvey Fuqua]]'s Harvey Records label.<ref name=\"AMG\">{{cite web |url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p61051/biography|pure_url=yes}}|title=Eddie \"Guitar\" Burns |author=Dahl, Bill |publisher=[[Allmusic]] |accessdate=February 23, 2010}}</ref> Now permanently billed as Eddie \"Guitar\" Burns, he appeared on Hooker's album ''[[The Real Folk Blues]]'' (1966).<ref name=\"Encyc\"/>\n\nIn 1972, Burns undertook a [[Europe]]an [[concert tour|tour]] and recorded his debut [[album]], ''Bottle Up & Go'' in [[London]], [[England]].<ref name=\"Encyc\"/><ref name=\"Wirz\"/> This was followed by an appearance at the [[Ann Arbor Blues and Jazz Festival]] in 1973.
