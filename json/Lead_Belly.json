He also wrote songs concerning the newsmakers of the day, such as [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], [[Adolf Hitler]], [[Jean Harlow]], the [[Scottsboro Boys]], and [[Howard Hughes]].\n\nIn 1988 Lead Belly was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in the \"Early Influence\" category. In 2008, he was also inducted into the [[Louisiana Music Hall of Fame]].\n\n==Biography==\n\n=== Early life ===\n[[File:Lead Belly draft registration card, ca. 1942.jpg|thumb|Lead Belly's WWII Draft Registration Card]]\n\nLead Belly was born Huddie William Ledbetter on the Jeter Plantation near [[Mooringsport, Louisiana]] in January 1888 or 1889.  The date is unclear: the [[1900 United States Census]] lists \"Hudy William Ledbetter\" as 12 years old, with a birth date of January 1888; the [[1910 United States Census]] and the [[1930 United States Census]] also list his birth year as 1888. However, in April 1942, Ledbetter filled out his [[World War II]] draft registration with a birth date of January 23, 1889 and a birthplace of [[Freeport, Louisiana]].  His grave marker reflects the date listed on his draft registration.\n \nHe was the younger of two children to Sallie Brown and Wesley Ledbetter, preceded by a sister named Australia. \"Huddie\" is pronounced \"HYEW-dee\" or \"HUGH-dee.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Epstein|first=Lawrence J.|title=Political Folk Music in America from Its Origins to Bob Dylan|year=2010|page=57|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Xlu-lidpKeMC&pg=PA57&lpg=PA57&dq=hugh+dee+ledbetter&source=bl&ots=f42pGe62QD&sig=TLYtj23Ja157jC0yYoKcG1nF8Qg&hl=en&sa=X&ei=sIRwUoTSE8uE2AXnqYG4DQ&ved=0CFgQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&q=hugh%20dee%20ledbetter&f=false}}</ref>  His parents, who had [[Cohabitation|cohabited]] for several years, married on February 26, 1888. When Huddie was five years old, the family settled in [[Bowie County, Texas]].\n\nBy 1903, Huddie was already a \"musicianer,\"<ref>{{cite book |author=Wolfe, Charles K; Lornell, Kip |title=The life and legend of Leadbelly |publisher=Da Capo Press |year=1999 |isbn=0-306-80896-X |page=28}}</ref> a singer and guitarist of some note. He performed for nearby [[Shreveport, Louisiana|Shreveport]] audiences in St. Paul's Bottoms, a notorious [[red-light district]] there. He began to develop his own style of music after exposure to a variety of musical influences on Shreveport's Fannin Street, a row of saloons, brothels, and dance halls in the Bottoms.\n\nThe 1910 census of [[Harrison County, Texas]], shows Ledbetter, listed as \"Hudy,\" living next door to his parents with his first wife, Aletha \"Lethe\" Henderson. Seventeen at the time, she had been 15 when married two years earlier. It was there that Ledbetter received his first instrument, an [[accordion]], from his uncle Terrell.  By his early 20s, after fathering at least two children, he left home to find his living as a guitarist and occasional laborer.\n\nInfluenced by the sinking of the ''[[RMS Titanic]]'' in April 1912, he wrote the song \"The Titanic,\"<ref>{{YouTube|Qe5tcr0yHN4|\"The Titanic\" by Leadbelly}}</ref> the first composed on the 12-string guitar later to become his signature instrument. Initially played when performing with [[Blind Lemon Jefferson]] (1897\u20131929) in and around [[Dallas, Texas]], the song is about champion African-American boxer [[Jack Johnson (boxer)|Jack Johnson]]'s being denied passage on the ''Titanic''.  While Johnson had in fact [[Jack Johnson (boxer)#Popular culture|been denied passage on a ship]] for being [[Black people|Black]], it had not been the ''Titanic''<ref>{{cite book|title=Swinging the Machine: Modernity, Technology, and African American Culture|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Ckdbz6ynxqEC&pg=PA124&lpg=PA124&dq=Jack+Johnson+denied+access+on+Titanic#v=onepage&q=Jack%20Johnson%20denied%20access%20on%20Titanic&f=false|author=Joel Dinerstein| publisher=|date=April 1, 2003|accessdate=November 18, 2011}}</ref> Still, the verse sang: \"Jack Johnson tried to get on board.

In 1915, he was convicted of carrying a pistol and sentenced to time on the Harrison County [[chain gang]].  He escaped, finding work in nearby [[Bowie County, Texas|Bowie County]] under the assumed name of Walter Boyd. In January 1918 he was imprisoned at the Imperial Farm (now [[Central Unit]])<ref name=\"Perkinson184\">Perkinson, Robert. ''Texas Tough: The Rise of America's Prison Empire''. First Edition.

It was there he may have first heard the traditional prison song [[Midnight Special (song)|\"Midnight Special\"]].<ref>Lomax, Alan, (editor). ''Folk Song USA''. New American Library.</ref>{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}  In 1925 he was pardoned and released after writing a song to Governor [[Pat Morris Neff]] seeking his freedom, having served the minimum seven years of a 7-to-35-year sentence. In combination with good behavior (including entertaining the guards and fellow prisoners), his appeal to Neff's strong religious beliefs proved sufficient. It was quite a testament to his persuasive powers, as Neff had run for governor on a pledge not to issue pardons (at the time the only recourse for prisoners, since in most Southern prisons there was no provision for [[parole]]).{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} According to Charles K. Wolfe and Kip Lornell's book, ''The Life and Legend of Leadbelly'' (1999), Neff had regularly brought guests to the prison on Sunday picnics to hear Ledbetter perform.\n\nIn 1930 Ledbetter was in [[Louisiana]]'s [[Louisiana State Penitentiary|Angola Prison Farm]] after a summary trial for attempted homicide, charged with knifing a white man in a fight. It was there he was \"discovered\" three years later during a visit by [[folklorist]]s [[John Lomax]] and his then 18-year-old son [[Alan Lomax]].<ref name=pc18>{{cite web|url=http://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc19768/m1/ |title=Show 18 - Blowin' in the Wind: Pop discovers folk music.

They returned with new and better equipment in July of the following year (1934), recording hundreds of his songs. On August 1, Ledbetter was released after having again served almost all of his minimum sentence following a petition the Lomaxes had taken to Louisiana Governor [[Oscar K. Allen]] at his urgent request. It was on the other side of a recording of his signature song, \"[[Goodnight Irene]].\"\n\nA prison official later wrote to John Lomax denying that Ledbetter's singing had anything to do with his release from Angola, state prison records confirming he was eligible for early release due to good behavior. For a time, however, both Ledbetter and the Lomaxes believed that the record they had taken to the governor had hastened his release from Angola.\n\n====Moniker====\nThere are several somewhat conflicting stories about how Ledbetter acquired the famous nickname \"Lead Belly\", though consensus holds it was probably while in prison. Some say his fellow inmates dubbed him \"Lead Belly\" as a play on his last name and reference to his physical toughness; it is recounted that during his second prison term, another inmate stabbed him in the neck (leaving him with a fearsome scar that he subsequently covered with a bandana), in defense Ledbetter nearly killed his attacker with his own knife.<ref name=\"mudcat\"/>\nOthers say he earned the name after being shot in the stomach with [[buckshot]].<ref name=\"mudcat\">The Mudcat Cafe. [http://www.mudcat.org/huddie.cfm Leadbelly - King of the 12 String Guitar] Retrieved on January 30, 2007</ref> Another theory has it that the name refers to his ability to drink [[moonshine]], home-made liquor which Southern farmers, black and white, used to make to supplement their incomes. Blues singer [[Big Bill Broonzy]] thought it came from a supposed tendency to lay about as if \"with a stomach weighted down by lead\" in the shade when the chain gang was supposed to be working.<ref>{{Cite book| last = Terkel | first = Studs | authorlink = Studs Terkel | year = 2005 | title = ''And They All Sang'' | publisher = New Press\n}}</ref> Or it may be that it is simply a corruption of his surname pronounced with a southern accent. Whatever its origin, he adopted the nickname as a pseudonym while performing, and it stuck.\n\n[[Image:Huddie Ledbetter (Leadbelly) and Martha Promise Ledbetter, Wilton, Conn..jpg|left|thumb|Huddie Ledbetter (Lead Belly) and Martha Promise Ledbetter, [[Wilton, Connecticut]], February 1935.]]\n\n===Life after prison===\nBy the time Lead Belly was released from prison the United States was deep in the [[Great Depression]] and jobs were very scarce. In September 1934, in need of regular work in order to avoid having his release canceled, Lead Belly met with John A. Lomax and asked him to take him on as a driver. For three months he assisted the 67-year-old in his folk song collecting abroad the South. (Son Alan was ill and did not accompany his father on this trip.)\n\nIn December Lead Belly participated in a \"smoker\" (group sing) at a [[Modern Language Association]] meeting at [[Bryn Mawr College]] in [[Pennsylvania]], where the senior Lomax had a prior lecturing engagement. He was written up in the press as a convict who had sung his way out of prison. On New Year's Day, 1935, the pair arrived in [[New York City]], where Lomax was scheduled to meet with his publisher, [[Macmillan Publishers (United States)|Macmillan]], about a new collection of folk songs. The newspapers were eager to write about the \"singing convict\" and [[Time (magazine)|''Time'']] magazine made one of its first filmed [[March of Time]] [[newsreel]]s about him. Lead Belly attained fame (although not fortune).\n\nThe following week, he began recording with [[American Record Corporation|ARC]], the [[race records]] division of [[Columbia Records]], but these recordings achieved little commercial success.  Of the over 40 sides he recorded for ARC (intended to be released on their Banner, Melotone, Oriole, Perfect, Romeo and very short-lived Paramount series), only five sides were actually issued. Part of the reason for the poor sales may have been because ARC insisted on releasing only his [[blues]] songs rather than the folk songs for which he would later become better known. In any case, Lead Belly continued to struggle financially. Like many performers, what income he made during his lifetime would come from touring, not from record sales.\n\nIn February 1935, he married his girlfriend, Martha Promise, who came north from Louisiana to join him.\n\nThe month of February was spent recording his and other [[African-American]] repertoire and interviews about his life with Alan Lomax for their forthcoming book, ''Negro Folk Songs as Sung by Lead Belly'' (1936). Concert appearances were however slow to materialize. In March 1935 Lead Belly accompanied John Lomax on a previously scheduled two-week lecture tour of colleges and universities in the Northeast, culminating at [[Harvard University|Harvard]].\n\nAt the end of the month John Lomax decided he could no longer work with Lead Belly and gave him and Martha money to go back to Louisiana by bus. He gave Martha the money her husband had earned during three months of performing, but in installments, on the pretext Lead Belly would drink it all if given a lump sum. From Louisiana Lead Belly successfully sued Lomax both for the full amount and release from his management contract. The quarrel was very bitter with hard feelings on both sides.  Curiously, in the midst of the legal wrangling, Lead Belly wrote to Lomax proposing they team up again.  It was not to be.  Further, the book about Lead Belly published by the Lomaxes in the fall of the following year proved a commercial failure.\n\nIn January 1936, Lead Belly returned to New York on his own without John Lomax in an attempted comeback. He performed twice a day at Harlem's [[Apollo Theater]] during the Easter season in a live dramatic recreation of the ''Time Life'' newsreel (itself a recreation) about his prison encounter with John A. Lomax, where he had worn stripes, though by this time he was no longer associated with Lomax.\n\n[[Life (magazine)|''Life'']] magazine ran a three-page article titled, \"Lead Belly - Bad Nigger Makes Good Minstrel,\" in its April 19, 1937 issue. It included a full-page, color (rare in those days) picture of him sitting on grain sacks playing his guitar and singing.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=kksEAAAAMBAJ&lpg=PA3&dq=life%20april%2019%2C%201937&pg=PA38#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=LIFE - Google Boeken |publisher= |date= |accessdate=December 30, 2011}}</ref> Also, included was a striking picture of Martha Promise (identified in the article as his manager); photos showing Lead Belly's hands playing the guitar (with the caption \"these hands once killed a man\"); Texas Governor [[Pat M. Neff]]; and the \"ramshackle\" Texas State Penitentiary.  The article attributes both of his pardons to his singing of his petitions to the governors, who were so moved that they pardoned him. The article's text ends with \"he... may well be on the brink of a new and prosperous period.\"\n\nLead Belly failed to stir the enthusiasm of [[Harlem]] audiences. Instead, he attained success playing at concerts and benefits for an audience of [[political left|leftist]] folk music ''aficionados.''  He developed his own style of singing and explaining his repertoire in the context of Southern black culture, taking the hint from his previous participation in John A. Lomax's college lectures. He was especially successful with his repertoire of children's game songs (as a younger man in Louisiana he had sung regularly at children's birthday parties in the black community). He was written up as a heroic figure by the black novelist, [[Richard Wright (author)|Richard Wright]], then a member of the [[Communist Party]], in the columns of the ''[[Daily Worker]],'' of which Wright was the Harlem editor.  The two men became personal friends, though Lead Belly himself was [[apolitical]] &mdash; if anything he was a supporter of [[Wendell Willkie]], the [[centrist]] [[U.S. Republican Party|Republican]] candidate, for whom he wrote a campaign song.\n\nIn 1939, Lead Belly was back in jail for [[assault]], after stabbing a man in a fight in [[Manhattan]]. Alan Lomax, then 24, took him under his wing and helped raise money for his legal expenses, dropping out of graduate school to do so. After his release (in 1940-41), Lead Belly appeared as a regular on Alan Lomax and [[Nicholas Ray]]'s groundbreaking [[CBS]] radio show, ''Back Where I Come From,'' broadcast nationwide. He also appeared in night clubs with [[Josh White]], becoming a fixture in New York City's surging folk music scene and befriending the likes of [[Sonny Terry]], [[Brownie McGhee]], [[Woody Guthrie]], and a young [[Pete Seeger]], all fellow performers on ''Back Where I Come From.'' During the first half of the decade he recorded for [[RCA]], the [[Library of Congress]], and for [[Moe Asch]] (future founder of [[Folkways Records]]), and in 1944 headed to [[California]], where he recorded strong sessions for [[Capitol Records]]. Lead Belly was the first American country blues musician to see success in [[Europe]].<ref name=\"mudcat\"/>\n\nIn 1949, Lead Belly had a regular radio broadcast on station WNYC in New York on Sunday nights on [[Henrietta Yurchenko]]'s show. Later in the year he began his first [[Europe]]an tour with a trip to [[France]], but fell ill before its completion, and was diagnosed with [[amyotrophic lateral sclerosis]] (ALS), or [[Lou Gehrig]]'s disease.<ref name=pc18/> His final concert was at the [[University of Texas at Austin]] in a tribute to his former mentor, John A. Lomax, who had died the previous year.  Martha also performed at that concert, singing spirituals with her husband.\n\nLead Belly died later that year in New York City, and was buried in the Shiloh Baptist Church cemetery in Mooringsport, {{convert|8|mi|km}} west of [[Blanchard, Louisiana|Blanchard]], in Caddo Parish.  He is honored with a life-size statue across from the Caddo Parish Courthouse in Shreveport.\n\n==Technique==\nLead Belly styled himself \"King of the 12-string guitar,\" and despite his use of other instruments like the accordion, the most enduring image of Lead Belly as a performer is wielding his unusually large Stella twelve-string.<ref>[http://uniqueguitar.blogspot.com/2009/11/stella-12-string-guitar.html THE UNIQUE GUITAR BLOG: The Stella 12 String Guitar<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> This guitar had a slightly longer scale length than a standard guitar, slotted tuners, ladder bracing, and a trapeze-style tailpiece to resist bridge lifting.{{Citation needed|date= October 2012}}\n\nLead Belly played with finger picks much of the time, using a thumb pick to provide a walking bass line and occasionally to strum.{{Citation needed|date= October 2012}} This technique, combined with low tunings and heavy strings, gives many of his recordings a piano-like sound. Lead Belly's tuning is debated,{{By whom|date= October 2012}} but appears to be a downtuned variant of standard tuning; more than likely he tuned his guitar strings relative to one another, so that the actual notes shifted as the strings wore. Lead Belly's playing style was popularized by [[Pete Seeger]], who adopted the twelve-string guitar in the 1950s and released an instructional LP and book using Lead Belly as an exemplar of technique.\n\nIn some of the recordings where Lead Belly accompanied himself, he would make an unusual type of grunt between his verses, best described as \"Haah!\" in many of his songs such as \"Looky Looky Yonder,\" \"[[Take this Hammer]],\"<ref name=pc18/> \"Linin' Track\" and \"Julie Ann Johnson\" feature this unusual vocalization.  In the song, \"Take this Hammer,\" Lead Belly explained, \"Every time the men say 'haah,' the hammer falls.
