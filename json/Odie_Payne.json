Knapp School of Percussion. By 1949 Payne was playing along with the [[pianist]] [[Little Johnny Jones (pianist)|Little Johnny Jones]], before meeting [[Tampa Red]] and enlisting into his band. The association lasted for around three years before, in 1952, Payne and Jones joined [[Elmore James]]'s band, the Broomdusters.<ref name=\"AMG\"/>\n\nPayne played with the Broomdusters for another three years, although his [[sound recording and reproduction|recording]] association with them lasted through to 1959. In total he recorded thirty one [[single (music)|singles]] with them, including \"[[The Sky Is Crying (song)|The Sky Is Crying]]\". By this time Payne had become a favored [[session musician]] appearing through that decade on the [[Cobra Records|Cobra]] [[record label|label]], with [[Otis Rush]], [[Magic Sam]], and [[Buddy Guy]]. His playing also can be heard on various [[Chess Records|Chess]] [[Gramophone record|records]], including the [[Chuck Berry]] [[hit single]]s \"[[Nadine (song)|Nadine]]\", \"[[You Never Can Tell (song)|You Never Can Tell]]\", \"[[Promised Land (song)|Promised Land]]\" and 1964's \"[[No Particular Place to Go]].\"<ref name=\"AMG\"/> All appeared on the Berry's 1982 [[compilation album]], ''[[The Great Twenty-Eight]]''.\n\nNoted for his usage of the [[Cowbell (instrument)|cowbell]], [[bass drum pedal]], and extended [[cymbal]] and [[drum roll]]s, Payne's double shuffle drumming technique was much copied and utilised by both [[Fred Below]] and Sam Lay.<ref name=\"AMG\">{{cite web |url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p110910/biography|pure_url=yes}}|title=Odie Payne |author=Erlewine, Michael|publisher=[[Allmusic]] |accessdate=May 27, 2010}}</ref> The technique called for Payne to use both his hands to effect the shuffle effect.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.drummerworld.com/Drumclinic/danielglassdoubleshuffle.html|title=Great Grooves from the History of R&B: \"No Particular Place to Go\" - Chuck Berry|author=Glass, Daniel|publisher=Drummerworld.com|accessdate=May 27, 2010}}</ref>\n\nPayne appears to have a [[songwriter|songwriting]] credit to his name for the song \"Say Man,\" which was recorded by both [[Bo Diddley]] and [[Willie Mabon]]; although Payne's name certainly did not appear on every version published.<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/odie-payne-jr-mn0000399343/songs |title=Odie Payne, Jr. &#124; Songs |publisher=AllMusic |date= |accessdate=2014-01-28}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Mark Deming |url=http://www.allmusic.com/song/say-man-mt0020113839 |title=Say Man - Bo Diddley &#124; Listen, Appearances, Song Review |publisher=AllMusic |date= |accessdate=2014-01-28}}</ref>\n\nOdie Payne died in Chicago in March 1989, at the age of 62.<ref name=\"Dead\"/>\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of Chicago blues musicians]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.google.co.uk/imgres?imgurl=http://www.earwigmusic.com/Images/payne.jpg&imgrefurl=http://www.earwigmusic.com/payne.shtml&usg=__NudbR8Z71KkG40RoYS_pIoRYvHo=&h=328&w=434&sz=41&hl=en&start=1&um=1&itbs=1&tbnid=ZAjWE2zbCvPVMM:&tbnh=95&tbnw=126&prev=/images%3Fq%3D%2522Odie%2BPayne%2522%26um%3D1%26hl%3Den%26sa%3DX%26rlz%3D1W1RNTN_en%26tbs%3Disch:1 Payne images at Earwigmusic.com]\n\n{{Authority control|VIAF=34644235}}\n{{Persondata <!-- Metadata: see [[Wikipedia:Persondata]]. -->\n| NAME              = Payne, Odie\n| ALTERNATIVE NAMES = \n| SHORT DESCRIPTION = [[United States|American]] [[Chicago blues]] [[drummer]]\n| DATE OF BIRTH     = August 27, 1926\n| PLACE OF BIRTH    = [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]], United States\n| DATE OF DEATH     = March 1, 1989\n| PLACE OF DEATH    = Chicago, Illinois, United States \n}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Payne, Odie}}\n[[Category:1926 births]]\n[[Category:1989 deaths]]\n[[Category:American blues musicians]]\n[[Category:American drummers]]\n[[Category:American session musicians]]\n[[Category:Blues drummers]]\n[[Category:Rhythm and blues drummers]]\n[[Category:Chicago blues musicians]]\n[[Category:Musicians from Chicago, Illinois]]"}]}}}}
