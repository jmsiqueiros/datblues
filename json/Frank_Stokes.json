''Blues Who's Who'' (Revised Ed.). New York: Da Capo Press. ISBN 0-306-80155-8  p.485</ref>  Stokes learned to play [[guitar]] as a [[adolescence|youth]] in Tutwiler, and, after 1895, in [[Hernando, Mississippi]], which was home to such [[African American]] guitarists as [[Jim Jackson (musician)|Jim Jackson]], [[Dan Sane]], Elijah Avery (of [[Gus Cannon|Cannon's Jug Stompers]]), and [[Robert Wilkins]].<ref name=\"Trail\">{{cite web |url=http://www.thebluestrail.com/artists/mus_fst.htm |title=Frank Stokes |author= |date= |work= |publisher=Thebluestrail.com |accessdate=November 19, 2011}}</ref> By the turn of the century, at the age of 12, Stokes worked as a [[blacksmith]], traveling the 25 miles to [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]] on the weekends to sing and play guitar with Sane, with whom he developed a long-term musical partnership. Together, they [[busking|busked]] on the streets and in Church's Park (now W. C. Handy Park) on Memphis' [[Beale Street]].<ref name=\"Trail\"/>\n\nIn the mid 1910s, Stokes joined forces with fellow Mississippian [[Garfield Akers]] as a blackface songster, comedian, and buck dancer in the Doc Watts [[Medicine Show]], a tent show that toured the South. During this period of touring, Stokes developed a sense of show business professionalism that set him apart from many of the more rural, less polished blues musicians of that time and place. It is said that his performances on the southern minstrel and vaudeville circuit around this time influenced [[Jimmie Rodgers (country singer)|Jimmie Rodgers]], who played the same circuit. Rodgers borrowed songs and song fragments from Stokes and was influenced stylistically as well.<ref>[http://www.jessicagrant.net/thesis/minmed.html 'How the Blues affected Race Relations in the United States' - Jessicagrant.net]</ref>\n\nAround 1920, Stokes settled in Oakville, Tennessee, where he went back to work as a blacksmith.<ref name=\"russell\"/> Stokes teamed up again with Sane and went to work playing dances, picnics, fish fries, saloons, and parties in his free time. Stokes and Sane joined Jack Kelly's Jug Busters to play white country clubs, parties and dances, and to play Beale Street together as the Beale Street Sheiks, first [[sound recording and reproduction|recording]] under that name for [[Paramount Records]] in August 1927.<ref name=\"russell\"/> All told, Stokes was to cut 38 sides for Paramount and [[Victor Records]]. \"The fluid guitar interplay between Stokes and Sane, combined with a propulsive beat, witty lyrics, and Stokes's stentorian voice, make their recordings irresistible.\"<ref>[http://www.cr.nps.gov/delta/blues/people/frank_stokes.htm 'Trail of the Hellhound:Frank Stokes @ cr.nps.gov]</ref>  Their [[duet (music)|duet]] style influenced the young [[Memphis Minnie]] in her duets with husband [[Kansas Joe McCoy]].<ref name=\"Trail\"/>\n\nThe Sheiks next recorded at a session for Victor Records where [[Furry Lewis]] also recorded.<ref name=\"Trail\"/> At this session, in February 1928, the emphasis was on blues, rather than the older songs that were also part of Stokes' repertoire. Stokes recorded again for Victor that August, playing \"I Got Mine\", one of a body of pre-blues songs about gambling, stealing and living high. He also recorded the more modern \"Nehi Mamma Blues\", which puns on the [[Nehi]] soft drink and the \"knee-high\" skirts that were fashionable at the time. Sane rejoined Stokes for the second day of the August 1928 session, and they produced a two-part version of \"[[Tain't Nobody's Business If I Do]]\", a song well known in later versions by [[Bessie Smith]] and [[Jimmy Witherspoon]], but whose origin lies somewhere in the pre-blues era.<ref>[http://www.document-records.com/fulldetails.asp?ProdID=DOCD-5013 Frank Stokes mini-biography @ Document-records.com]</ref> The Sheiks also continued to busk the streets, and play informally at parties.<ref name=\"Trail\"/>\n\nIn 1929, Stokes and Sane recorded again for Paramount, resuming their 'Beale Street Sheiks' billing for a few cuts. In September, Stokes was back on Victor to make what were to be his last [[sound recording and reproduction|recordings]], this time without Sane, but with Will Batts on [[fiddle]].<ref name=\"russell\"/> Stokes and Batts were a team as evidenced by these records, which are both traditional and wildly original, but their style had fallen out of favor with the blues record buying public. Stokes was still a popular live performer, however, appearing in medicine shows, the [[Ringling Brothers Circus]], and other tent shows and similar venues during the 1930s and 1940s. During the 1940s, Stokes moved to [[Clarksdale, Mississippi|Clarksdale]], and occasionally worked with [[Bukka White]] in local juke joints.<ref name=\"russell\"/>\n\nStokes died of a [[stroke]] in Memphis on September 12, 1955.<ref name=\"Dead\"/><ref name=\"Trail\"/> He is buried there in Hollywood Cemetery.\n\n==Songs recorded by Stokes==\n*\"Ain't Goin' to Do Like I Used to Do\"\n*\"Beale Town Bound\"\n*\"Bedtime Blues\"\n*\"Blues in \"D\"\"\n*\"Chicken You Can Roost Behind the Moon\"\n*\"Downtown Blues\"\n*\"Fillin' in Blues\"\n*\"Frank Stokes' Dream\"\n*\"Half Cup of Tea\"\n*\"How Long\"\n*\"Hunting Blues\"\n*\"I Got Mine\"\n*\"I'm Going Away Blues\"\n*\"It Won't Be Long Now\"\n*\"It's A Good Thing\"\n*\"Jazzin' the Blues\"\n*\"Jumpin On The Hill\"\n*\"Last Go Round\"\n*\"Memphis Rounders Blues\"\n*\"Mistreatin' Blues\"\n*\"Mr. Crump Don't Like It\"\n*\"Nehi Mama\"\n*\"Old Sometime Blues\"\n*\"Right Now Blues\"\n*\"Rockin' on the Hill Blues\"\n*\"South Memphis Blues\"\n*\"Sweet to Mama\"\n*\"[[Ain't Nobody's Business|Tain't Nobody's Business If I Do]]\"\n*\"Take Me Back\"\n*\"Wasn't That Doggin' Me\"\n*\"What's The Matter Blues\"\n*\"You Shall\"\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.cr.nps.gov/delta/blues/people/frank_stokes.htm Frank Stokes - Memphis School]\n*[http://www.jessicagrant.net/thesis/minmed.html How the Blues Affected Race Relations in the United States: Minstrel and Medicine Shows]\n*[http://www.document-records.com/fulldetails.asp?ProdID=DOCD-5013 Frank Stokes The Victor Recordings 1928 - 1929]\n\n{{Americanrootsmusic}}\n\n{{Persondata <!-- Metadata: see [[Wikipedia:Persondata]]. -->\n| NAME              = Stokes, Frank\n| ALTERNATIVE NAMES =\n| SHORT DESCRIPTION = [[United States|American]] blues musician, songster, and blackface minstrel\n| DATE OF BIRTH     = January 1, 1888\n| PLACE OF BIRTH    = [[Shelby County, Tennessee]], United States\n| DATE OF DEATH     = September 12, 1955\n| PLACE OF DEATH    = [[Memphis, Tennessee]], United States\n}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Stokes, Frank}}\n[[Category:1888 births]]\n[[Category:1955 deaths]]\n[[Category:Memphis blues musicians]]\n[[Category:African-American musicians]]\n[[Category:American blues guitarists]]\n[[Category:American blues singers]]\n[[Category:Paramount Records artists]]\n[[Category:American buskers]]\n[[Category:Songster musicians]]\n[[Category:Musicians from Tennessee]]\n[[Category:Vaudeville performers]]\n[[Category:Deaths from stroke]]"}]}}}}
