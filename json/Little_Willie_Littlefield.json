C. Lovin'\" &mdash; in 1952.\n\n==Career==\n[[File:Littlewillielittlefield.jpg|thumb|right|Littlefield in Germany, 2006]]\nLittlefield was born in [[El Campo, Texas|El Campo]], [[Texas]], and grew up in [[Houston]] with his mother.  By 1947, at the age of sixteen, Littlefield was already a local attraction on many of Houston's Dowling Street clubs and was recording for local record shop proprietor Eddie Henry who ran his own label, \"Eddie's\".<ref name=jump>Jump with Little Willie Littlefield, Ace Records, CHD114, sleeve notes by Ray Topping, 1984</ref>  He formed his first band with saxophonist [[Don Wilkerson]], a school friend.<ref name=\"washington post\"/>\n\nLittlefield was strongly influenced by boogie-woogie pianist [[Albert Ammons]]. A particular favourite of his was Ammons' ''Swanee River Boogie'', which he later recorded for Eddie's Records.<ref name=jump/> Other major influences on  Littlefield's style were Texas musicians [[Charles Brown (musician)|Charles Brown]] and [[Amos Milburn]]<ref name=\"allmusic.com\"/> Littlefield learned most of their \"chops\" and soon developed his own distinctive \"triplet style\", which, by the early 1950s, was widely copied in the R&B field, particularly by [[Fats Domino]] who incorporated it into his successful [[New Orleans]] rhythms.<ref name=jump/>\n\nHis first [[sound recording and reproduction|recording]], \"Little Willie\u2019s Boogie\" was a [[hit record|hit]] in Texas in 1949, and brought him to the attention of Jules Bihari, one of the [[Bihari brothers]] of [[Modern Records]] in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], [[California]], who were searching for a performer to rival the success of Amos Milburn.<ref name=\"washington post\"/> Bihari flew to [[Houston]] in July 1949 to investigate the city's black entertainment venues and heard of a \"teenage wonder boy pianist\" who was causing a stir at the Eldorado Ballroom. Bihari went to hear Littlefield and soon arranged for an audition at a local studio. The session was captured on [[acetate disc]], with Bihari, clearly audible in the background, calling for Littlefield to play the popular R&B tunes of the day.<ref name=jump/>\n\nBack at Modern Records, he recorded \"It's Midnight\", which became a national hit reaching #3 on the ''[[Billboard charts|Billboard]]'' [[R&B chart]]. Its follow-up, \"Farewell\", reached #5 on the R&B chart.<ref name=\"whitburnr&b\">{{cite book |title= Top R&B/Hip-Hop Singles: 1942-1995|last=Whitburn |first=Joel |authorlink=Joel Whitburn |year=1996 |publisher=Record Research |page=271}}</ref> He became a major [[nightclub]] attraction and recorded with [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]] [[musician]]s such as [[Maxwell Davis]].  Don Wilkerson, Littlefield's old school buddy and the leading saxman in his band, also travelled to Los Angeles, but Milburn promptly stole him to lead his own new band 'The [[Aladdin Records (US)|Aladdin]] Chickenshackers'.<ref name=jump />\n\nModern Records booked Littlefield for three recording sessions during October 1949, followed by more sessions in the following two months at Radio Recorders in [[Hollywood]]. During these three months alone, over 22 sides were cut - an unusual output when compared to most other artists who averaged only two sessions a year. Other musicians for these sessions included saxophonists [[Maxwell Davis]] and Buddy Floyd, guitarists Chuck Norris and Johnny Moore, and drummers [[Al \"Cake\" Wichard|Al Wichard]] and Jessie Price.<ref name=jump />  One of his 1950 recordings, \"Happy Pay Day\", a song written by Jack Holmes, was later rewritten by Holmes with entirely different lyrics as \"[[The Blacksmith Blues]]\", which became a hit for [[Ella Mae Morse]].<ref name=secondhand>[http://www.secondhandsongs.com/work/123447  \"Happy Pay-Off Day\" at SecondHandSongs.com]. Retrieved 29 December 2012</ref>\n\nIn 1951, his duet with Little Lora Wiggins, \"I've Been Lost\", reached #10 on the R&B chart.<ref name=\"whitburnr&b\"/>  In 1952 he moved to the [[Federal Records|Federal]] subsidiary of [[King Records (USA)|King Records]], his first session producing \"K. C. Loving\", written by [[Leiber and Stoller]] and later re-recorded by [[Wilbert Harrison]] as \"[[Kansas City (R&B song)|Kansas City]]\".\n\nBy 1957 Littlefield had moved to Northern California and continued to record for Don Barksdale's Rhythm label in [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]] where he produced the single \"Ruby, Ruby\".<ref name=jump />  Littlefield\u2019s recording and his subsequent releases were not successful, although he remained a popular club act in the San Francisco area.\n\nIn the late 1970s he toured [[Europe]] successfully, settling in the [[Netherlands]] and releasing a number of albums from 1982 into the late 1990s for the [[Oldie Blues]] label from Martin van Olderen.<ref>Olderen, Martin van, ''I'm In The Mood'', Linernotes OLCD 7002, 1993</ref>\n\nBeing on the road for more than 50 years, Littlefield stopped touring in 2000. After five years of retirement in his adopted home country The Netherlands, Little Willie Littlefield decided to play again starting in 2006. \"I went fishing for five years - now I know every herring in Holland by name - it got boring. I feel great and I want to be back with my audience\", Little Willie declared.<ref>[http://www.ukboogiewoogiefestival.co.uk/content/view/102/54/ 9th UK Boogie Woogie Festival]</ref>\n\nIn his later years Littlefield continued to perform occasionally, mainly at [[music festival|festivals]], particularly in the UK. In 2008 he played at the 20th [[Burnley|Burnley Blues Festival]] and in July 2009 at the 5th annual UK Boogie Woogie Festival at [[Sturminster Newton]] in [[Dorset]]. Having appeared at Shakedown Blues Club, at Castor Hall, near [[Castor, Cambridgeshire|Castor]], [[Peterborough]] in 2006, Littlefield made a return appearance in October 2010.<ref>[http://www.shakedownblues.co.uk Shakedownblues.co.uk]</ref>\n\nHe died at his home in [[Voorthuizen]], [[the Netherlands]], in 2013 at the age of 81.
