She is best known for her 1995 single \"Shade of Your Love\", one of the year's biggest hits on [[adult contemporary music|adult contemporary]] radio stations in Canada,<ref name=trurodaily>[http://www.trurodaily.com/News/Local/2011-02-01/article-2190779/Folk-artist-Smith-performing-in-Bible-Hill/1 \"Folk artist Smith performing in Bible Hill\"]. ''Truro Daily News'', February 1, 2011.</ref> and for her adaptation of the [[Scottish music|Scottish]] folk song \"[[My Bonnie Lies over the Ocean]]\" which she entitled \"My Bonny\". She recorded a version of this with [[The Chieftains]], which they erroneously listed as \"My Bonnie\" on their album ''[[Fire in the Kitchen]]''. In December 2010, that version received a nod for Song of the Decade from Bill Margeson at LiveIreland.  \n\nBorn and raised in [[London, Ontario]], Smith was encouraged in her early writing by the noted poet [[Margaret Avison]], then writer-in-residence at the [[University of Western Ontario]]. She began playing music as well, making her debut in area coffeehouses. She moved to [[Toronto]] in 1975 for nine years and in 1984 she moved to [[Cape Breton Island|Cape Breton]].<ref name=Who/> \n\nSmith released her debut album, ''Elemental'', under the auspices of CBC Variety Recordings in 1989. It was recorded at [[CBHT-DT|CBC Halifax]].  Alas, unbeknownst to Smith or CBC, at about the same time, [[Loreena McKennitt]] released an album with the same title, so Smith's debut release was changed to ''Laura Smith'' when she leased back the masters from CBC.  Her second album, ''B'tween the Earth and My Soul'' (1994) brought her national acclaim and earned her two [[East Coast Music Awards]] (Female Artist, Album of the Year) and two [[Juno Awards|Juno]] nominations for [[Juno Award for New Artist of the Year|Best New Solo Artist]] and [[Juno Award for Roots & Traditional Album of the Year \u2013 Solo|Best Roots and Traditional Album]]. The next year, 1997, she was awarded a [[Gemini Award]] for Best Performance in a Performing Arts Program or Series.<ref name=Who/> \n\nShe continued to work through the 2000s, including two seasons on stage in [[Prince Edward Island]] in the role of Marilla in the musical ''[[Anne & Gilbert]]'' at the Victoria Playhouse in [[Victoria, Prince Edward Island|Victoria-by-the-Sea]] and the Jubilee Theatre in [[Summerside, Prince Edward Island|Summerside]] respectively.<ref name=Who/> However, through the decade she suffered three debilitating accidents which resulted in [[chronic pain]]. This led to the use of increasingly stronger [[prescription drug]]s which eventually led to dependence. She attempted to obtain a Music Therapy degree from [[Acadia University]], but gave up her studies to concentrate on healing.  She disappeared from the music scene for a time, but by 2010 she was performing again, having overcome her dependency through the adoption of non-narcotic pain treatment therapies. Her story was featured in a radio documentary which aired on [[CBC Radio One]]'s morning program ''[[The Current (radio program)|The Current]]'' on February 3, 2010.<ref>[http://www.cbc.ca/thecurrent/episode/2011/02/03/the-blues-i---the-story-of-laura-smith/ The Blues and I: The Story of Laura Smith] (audio).</ref> In 2010 and 2011 she performed several shows across Canada, touring with [[Ryan MacGrath]].<ref name=trurodaily />\n\nIn 2012 [[Cathie Ryan]] recorded a version of Smith's \"I'm a Beauty\" on her album ''Through Wind and Rain''.\n\nSmith completed her first recording in sixteen years, ''Everything Is Moving'', in January 2013. It was released by [[Borealis Records]] on April 10, 2013.<ref>{{cite web|last=Regenstreif|first=Mike|title=Laura Smith - Everything is Moving|url=http://frfb.blogspot.ca/2013/04/laura-smith-everything-is-moving.html|publisher=Folk Roots/Folk Branches (blog)|accessdate=28 April 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Discography==\n\n===Albums===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!
