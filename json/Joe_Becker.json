In addition to writing and recording all the music himself, he also plays all the instruments heard on his records (guitar, bass, piano, strings) with the exception of drums.\n\nBecker stopped writing, playing and recording music in 2009 for personal reasons.\n\n==Movies and soundtracks==\nBecker can be heard on the soundtrack of B-Horror film, ''Evil Awakening'', a Tempe Video release.\n\nBecker's tracks \"Hot As Love\" and \"Hard Times\" were featured in the 2011 film ''The Fixer,'' from RavensFilm Productions.<ref>{{cite web|author=Nicholas J.
