It formed in 1994 when former members of the band Second Self met a blind street performer by the name of Robert Bradley.

He had spent several years in Detroit by 1994, performing occasionally on the street busking, and playing on Saturdays in Detroit's [[Eastern Market Historic District|Eastern Market]],<ref>http://www.enotes.com/contemporary-musicians/robert-bradley-s-blackwater-surprise-biography</ref> when guitarist Michael Nehra, bassist Andrew Nehra, and drummer Jeff Fowlkes (formerly in the Detroit band SECOND SELF) overheard Bradley through an open window while rehearsing for a new project.
