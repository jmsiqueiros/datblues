In 1973 he listened to recordings of boogie-woogie pianists [[Albert Ammons]], [[Meade \"Lux\" Lewis]], and [[Pete Johnson]]. He soon joined piano playing partners Hans-Georg Moeller, Vince Weber and Martin Pyrker, and word about the four friends began to spread. In 1974, he played at the First International Blues-and-Boogie Woogie Festival of the West German Radio Station in Cologne which was followed by Hans Maitner's annual festival Stars of Boogie Woogie in [[Vienna]]. \n\nBy 1975, Zwingenberger received his first recording contract, issuing such solo recordings as ''Boogie Woogie Breakdown'', ''Power House Boogie'', and ''Boogie Woogie Live'', as well as lending his talents to recordings by such artists as [[Lionel Hampton]], [[Jay McShann]], [[Big Joe Turner]], [[Lloyd Glenn]], [[Joe Newman (trumpeter)|Joe Newman]], [[Sippie Wallace]], [[Mama Yancey]], [[Champion Jack Dupree]], [[Sammy Price]], [[Ray Bryant]], [[Charlie Watts]], [[Bill Wyman]], [[Vince Weber]], and the [[Mojo Blues Band]], among others. In addition to issuing other solo recordings, Zwingenberger continues to tour all over the world. He has also authored several publications about blues/boogie-woogie music and musicians as well as ''Boogie Woogie: Piano Solo'', a book of 12 of his compositions, exactly transcribed.<ref>Axel Zwingenberger: ''Boogie Woogie: Piano Solo'' (1997) - ISBN 3-926398-01-9</ref>\n\nBeing a [[List of notable railfans|railfan]] since early childhood, he is also known for his photographs of [[steam locomotives]],<ref>Axel Zwingenberger, ''Vom Zauber der Z\u00fcge'' - ''The Magic of Trains'' photo book - ISBN 3-926398-02-7</ref> including some taken from within the machinery itself. Zwingenberger established a non-profit foundation within the German Foundation for the Protection of Historical Monuments which donates for the preservation of monuments on rails, including the world's fastest operational steam locomotive, the German [[DR 18 201]].\n\nIn spring 2009, coordinated by young pianist Ben Waters from the UK, Zwingenberger renewed his relationship with [[Charlie Watts]], drummer of [[The Rolling Stones]]. Together with bassist [[Dave Green (musician)|Dave Green]], they played joint concerts billed as The ABC&D of Boogie Woogie. In June 2012 they released their first joint album ''The ABC&D of Boogie Woogie - live in Paris'' and presented it in New York by playing concerts at [[Lincoln Center]] and [[Iridium Jazz Club|The Iridium Jazz Club]].\n\n==Selective discography==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Year\n!Title\n!Solo albums\n!Label\n|-\n|1996\n|''Boogie Back To New York City''\n|solo - live\n|Vagabond\n|-\n|1992\n|''Boogie Woogie Classics'' \n|solo\n|Polygram Int'l \n|-\n|1985\n|''Boogie Woogie live''\n|solo - all original compositions by A.Z.<ref>Axel Zwingenberger: ''Boogie Woogie Piano Solo'': transcription of the CD VRCD 8.85007 - ISBN 3-926398-01-9</ref>\n|Vagabond (also issued on Calligraph)\n|-\n|1980\n|''Power House Boogie''\n|solo\n|Vagabond\n|-\n|1978\n|''Boogie Woogie Breakdown''\n|solo\n|Telefunken\n|-\n!Year\n!Title\n!Combinations\n!Label\n|-\n|2012\n|''The ABC&D of Boogie Woogie - Live in Paris''\n|Axel Zwingenberger, Ben Waters, [[Charlie Watts]] & Dave Green\n|[[Eagle Records]]\n|-\n|2012\n|''The Joy of Boogie Woogie''\n|w/ Keito Saito, p\n|Quatre Mains Records, Japan\n|-\n|2010\n|''The Magic of Boogie Woogie''\n|w/ [[Charlie Watts]], dr & Dave Green, b\n|Vagabond\n|-\n|2009\n|''Lady sings the Boogie Woogie''\n|w/ [[Lila Ammons]], voc\n|Vagabond\n|-\n|2008\n|''Saxy Boogie Woogie''\n|w/ [[Big Jay McNeely]], sax & The Bad Boys\n|Vagabond\n|-\n|2004\n|''Groovology''\n|w/ Gottfried Boettger, p\n|Vagabond\n|-\n|1999\n|''Brothers in Boogie'' \n|w/ Torsten Zwingenberger, dr\n|Vagabond\n|-\n|1999\n|''The Boogiemeisters''\n|w/ [[Vince Weber]], p + voc\n|Vagabond\n|-\n|1996\n|''Swing the Boogie!''\n|w/ [[Jay McShann]], p + voc\n|Vagabond\n|-\n|1982\n|''The Boogie Woogie Album''\n|w/ [[Lionel Hampton]] Orchestra\n|Vagabond\n|-\n|1978\n|''Let's Boogie Woogie All Night Long''\n|w/ [[Big Joe Turner]], voc - German Record Award 1979\n|Vagabond\n|-\n|1976\n|''Boogie Woogie Session '76 live in Vienna''\n|w/ Hans-Georg M\u00f6ller, Martin Pyrker & Torsten Zwingenberger\n|EMI\n|-\n!Year\n!Title\n!''Axel Zwingenberger & The Friends Of Boogie Woogie - Series''\n!Label\n|-\n|2000\n|''Vol. 10: Kansas City Boogie Jam''\n|w/ [[Big Joe Duskin]], voc, [[Sammy Price]], p, [[Jay McShann]], p\n|Vagabond\n|-\n|1999\n|''Vol. 9: Red Hot Boogie Woogie Party''\n|w/ [[Red Holloway]], sax & voc, Mojo Blues Band - live\n|Vagabond\n|-\n|1993\n|''Vol. 8: Heat It Up''\n|w/ [[Red Holloway]], sax & voc, Mojo Blues Band\n|Vagabond\n|-\n|1992\n|''Vol. 7: Champion Jack Dupree sings Blues Classics''\n|w/ [[Champion Jack Dupree]], voc, Mogens \"Basse\" Seidelin, b, Michael Strasser, dr\n|Vagabond\n|-\n|1990\n|''Vol. 6: On Stage with Champion Jack Dupree''\n|w/ [[Champion Jack Dupree]], voc & Torsten Zwingenberger, dr\n|Vagabond\n|-\n|1988\n|''Vol. 5: Champ's Housewarming''\n|w/ [[Champion Jack Dupree]], voc, Mojo Blues Band\n|Vagabond\n|-\n|1987\n|''Vol. 4: The Blues Of Mama Yancey''\n|w/ Estella \"Mama\" Yancey, voc\n|Vagabond\n|-\n|1986\n|''Vol. 3: An Evening with Sippie Wallace''\n|w/ [[Sippie Wallace]], voc - live\n|Vagabond\n|-\n|1985\n|''Vol. 2: Between Hamburg & Hollywood''\n|w/ [[Big Joe Turner]], voc, [[Joe Newman]], tp & voc, [[Lloyd Glenn]], p, Torsten Zwingenberger, dr\n|Vagabond\n|-\n|1984\n|''Vol. 1: Sippie Wallace''\n|w/ [[Sippie Wallace]], voc\n|Vagabond\n|}\n\nZwingenberger also appeared on ''Just For A Thrill'' by [[Bill Wyman's Rhythm Kings]]\n\n==Books==\n* [[Richard Cook (journalist)|Richard Cook]] & [[Brian Morton (Scottish writer)|Brian Morton]]: ''Penguin Guide to Jazz Recordings'', Penguin, first issue 1992, 8th 2006, ISBN 978-0-14-102327-4\n* [[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]: ''The Guinness Who's Who of Jazz'', Guinness Books UK, from 1992 on, ISBN 0-85112-580-8\n* Peter Silvester: ''The Story Of Boogie Woogie - A Left Hand Like God'', Quartet Books UK, 1988, updated issue 2009, Scarecrow Press, ISBN 978-0-8108-6924-0\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.boogiewoogie.net/home_englisch.html Axel Zwingenberger's homepage]\n*[http://www.colindavey.com/BoogieWoogie/articles/axel.htm Interview with Axel Zwingenberger]\n*{{IMDb Name|3625928|Axel Zwingenberger}}\n*[{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p21593/biography|pure_url=yes}} Axel Zwingenberger biography at All Music]\n\n{{Authority control|VIAF=71182986|PND=134566211}}\n{{Persondata <!-- Metadata: see [[Wikipedia:Persondata]]. -->\n| NAME              =Zwingenberger, Axel\n| ALTERNATIVE NAMES =\n| SHORT DESCRIPTION = German musician\n| DATE OF BIRTH     =May 7, 1955\n| PLACE OF BIRTH    =\n| DATE OF DEATH     =\n| PLACE OF DEATH    =\n}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Zwingenberger, Axel}}\n[[Category:1955 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:Musicians from Hamburg]]\n[[Category:Blues pianists]]\n[[Category:Boogie-woogie pianists]]\n[[Category:German jazz pianists]]"}]}}}}
