He made his solo debut that same year with [[Federal Records|Federal]], a subsidiary of [[King Records (USA)|King Records]] of Cincinnati, backed by [[Freddie King]] on guitar.\n\nHe then began recording for [[Twilight/Twinight Records|Twinight Records]] of Chicago in the mid-1960s. Beginning with his first hit, \"Come On Sock It to Me\" in 1967, Johnson dominated the label as both a hitmaker and producer. His song \"Different Strokes\", also from 1967, featured on the ''[[Ultimate Breaks and Beats]]'' [[breakbeat]] [[compilation album|compilation]].\n\nLike other black songwriters of the period, several of his records at this time explored themes of African-American identity and social problems as in songs including \"Is It Because I'm Black\", which reached Number 11 in the US ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs|R&B]] [[record chart|chart]] in 1969.\n\nIn 1971, [[Willie Mitchell (musician)|Willie Mitchell]] brought Johnson to [[Hi Records]], the two recording three albums which spawned a number of singles. Produced in [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]] with the Hi house band, these yielded the hits \"We Did It\", \"Back for a Taste of Your Love\" and \"Take Me to the River\", his biggest success, reaching Number 7 on the R&B chart in 1975. However, at Hi Records, Johnson was always to some extent in [[Al Green]]'s shadow commercially, if not artistically. Mitchell also chose to use mainly in-house material rather than Johnson originals.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}\n\nAfter the Hi years ended, Johnson produced two LPs for his own Shama label, the latter of which (''Ms. Fine Brown Frame'', 1982) was picked up for distribution by [[Boardwalk Records]] and produced Johnson's last hit record, the title cut.\n\nAround the mid-1980s, Johnson started a fast-food fish restaurant business, and became semi-retired from performing, only making occasional appearances at blues club gigs.<ref name=liner>Liner notes to album ''Back in the Game'' by Robert Pruter</ref>\n\nIn 1992, Johnson found out that his song \"Different Strokes\" had been [[sampling (music)|sampled]] by number of [[rapping|rappers]] including [[Wu-Tang Clan]], [[Public Enemy (band)|Public Enemy]], [[Kool G Rap]], [[MC Hammer|Hammer]], and the [[Geto Boys]]. Stimulated by this fact, he decided to make a comeback in the [[music industry]].<ref name=liner /> In 1994, he released the album ''Back in the Game'' on [[Delmark Records]]. The album featured the Hi rhythm section and his youngest daughter [[Syleena Johnson]].\n\nJohnson has become one of the most sampled artists, largely from \"Different Strokes\" and \"Is It Because I'm Black\"; he feels passionately that taking music from an original artist without proper compensation constitutes theft<ref>{{cite web|last=Hoffer|first=Jason|title=Interview Continued With Blues/Soul Legend Syl Johnson - Come on, sock it to me S02Ep01 (2 of 3)|url=http://goingthruvinyl.com/?p=1496|work=S02Ep1-2-of-3-Syl-Johnson-Come-on-sock-it-to-me.mp3|publisher=Going Thru Vinyl|accessdate=16 June 2012|coauthors=Syl Johnson|location=12:25|format=.mp3 audio}}</ref>  and has sued for copyright infringement.<ref>{{cite web|last=Gardner|first=Eriq Gardner|title=Kanye West and Jay-Z Sued for Allegedly Sampling Syl Johnson|url=http://www.billboard.biz/bbbiz/industry/legal-and-management/kanye-west-and-jay-z-sued-for-allegedly-1005416982.story|publisher=The Hollywood Reporter|accessdate=16 June 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Mlynar|first=Phillip|title=Interviews Q&A: Soul Singer Syl Johnson Prefers Money To Women, Loves Being Sampled By The Wu-Tang Clan, And Is Sorry He Had To Sue Cypress Hill|url=http://blogs.villagevoice.com/music/2010/12/syl_johnson.php|publisher=The Village Voice|accessdate=16 June 2012}}</ref> Adding to Syl's famous family are his brothers, Blues guitarist and singer [[Jimmy Johnson (blues guitarist)|Jimmy Johnson]] and bassist Mack Thompson.\n\nSyl Johnson recently appeared on an episode of TV ONE's \"R&B Divas,\" which starred his daughter Syleena Johnson.
