He recorded five albums for [[JSP Records]], the first being ''Boogie Boy! The Texas Guitar Tornado Returns!'', and was known for playing a style of deep Southern [[soul blues]] that was gospel inflected.<ref name=\"AMG\"/>\n\n==Biography==\n'''Huary Perry Wilson''' was born on a farm in Catto Parish, [[Shreveport, Louisiana]], to parents Carrie Lee and Tommy Wilson.<ref name=\"Club\"/> Raised in [[West Dallas]], Wilson learned the blues from ZuZu Bollin, Cat Man Fleming, [[Frankie Lee Sims]], [[Mercy Baby]] and Nappy \"Chin\" Evans. Wilson later relocated from Dallas to [[Fort Worth]] and formed a [[duet (music)|duo]], the Boogie Chillun Boys, with the [[drummer]] and [[singing|vocalist]],  [[Robert Ealey]]. Later he worked with [[Cornell Dupree]] before Dupree left to become a [[session musician]].<ref name=\"AMG\">{{cite web|author=Richard Skelly |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/up-wilson-mn0000220517/biography |title=U.P.

At night, Wilson  performed as a [[sideman]] in local [[nightclub]]s.<ref name=\"Club\"/> By the late 1970s, Wilson and Ealey played at a Fort Worth club named the New Bluebird, where they attracted crowds of Texas blues fans. By 1987, Wilson had began solo recording, and touring around Texas.<ref name=\"AMG\"/> However, he subsequently rejoined Ealey in his new band, The Lovers, the following year.<ref name=\"Club\"/>\n\n[[Music journalism|Music journalist]], Tony Russell, noted that Wilson put on a show, playing one-handed while drinking, smoking and greeting his [[fan (person)|fans]], but behind the tricks and the hyped language used in his billings ('Texas Tornado', 'Atomic Guitar' etc.,) Wilson was a musician with a talent for more than just getting boys to boogie down. His peculiar decision to sing in [[falsetto]] flawed his 1995 release ''This Is U.P. Wilson'', but subsequent releases re-discovered his blend of Texas shuffles and low-down blues.<ref name=\"russell\">{{cite book\n| first= Tony\n| last= Russell\n| year= 1997\n| title= The Blues: From Robert Johnson to Robert Cray\n| edition= \n| publisher= Carlton Books Limited \n| location= Dubai\n| pages= 191\u2013192\n| isbn= 1-85868-255-X}}</ref> \n\nFor most of the last decade of his life, Wilson toured both the European blues circuit and throughout the [[United States]]. Activities included appearances at the [[Chicago Blues Festival]], and playing accompaniment to [[Albert Collins]]. Wilson was imprisoned for six months in the John R.L. Jacksboro State Penitentiary for [[cocaine]] possession between 1997 and 1998, and on his release moved to live in [[Paris]], [[France]].<ref name=\"Club\"/>\n\nWilson went to hospital in Paris for surgery, and he died there on September 22, 2004, at the age of 70.
