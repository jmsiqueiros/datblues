Their best known line-up consisted of lead singer [[Roger Daltrey]], guitarist [[Pete Townshend]], bassist [[John Entwistle]] and drummer [[Keith Moon]]. For much of their career they have been regarded as one of the three most important British rock acts along with [[the Beatles]] and [[the Rolling Stones]] and one of the [[List of best-selling music artists|world's best-selling bands of all time]], having sold more than 100 million records.<ref name=\"The Who\">{{cite web|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/artists/the-who/biography |title=The Who |work=[[Rolling Stone]] |accessdate=3 November 2012}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.newsletter.co.uk/what-s-on/music/the-who-s-quadrophrenia-will-be-revisited-in-belfast-1-4742083|title=The Who\u2019s Quadrophrenia will be revisited in Belfast|publisher=[[The News Letter]]|date=2013-02-01|accessdate=2013-05-21|last=The News Letter|first=Reporter}}</ref>\n\nThe Who developed from an earlier group, the Detours, before stabilising around a line-up of Daltrey, Townshend, Entwistle and Moon. After releasing a single billed as the High Numbers, the group established themselves as part of the [[mod (subculture)|mod movement]], specialising in [[auto-destructive art]] by destroying guitars and drums onstage. They achieved recognition in the UK after support by [[pirate radio]] and television, and their first single as the Who, \"[[I Can't Explain]]\", reached the top ten. A string of hit singles followed including \"[[My Generation]]\", \"[[Substitute (The Who song)|Substitute]]\" and \"[[Happy Jack (song)|Happy Jack]]\". Although initially regarded as a singles act, they also found success with the albums ''[[My Generation (album)|My Generation]]'' and ''[[A Quick One]]''. In 1967, they achieved success in the US after performing at the [[Monterey Pop Festival]], and with the top ten single \"[[I Can See for Miles]]\". They released ''[[The Who Sell Out]]'' at the end of the year, and spent much of 1968 touring the US.\n\nThe release of their fourth album, ''[[Tommy (album)|Tommy]]'', in 1969 was a major commercial and critical achievement. Subsequent live appearances at [[Woodstock]] and the [[Isle of Wight Festival]], along with the live album ''[[Live At Leeds]]'', transformed the Who's reputation from a hit-singles band into a critically acclaimed rock act. With their success came increased pressure on lead songwriter Townshend, and the follow-up to ''Tommy'', ''[[Lifehouse (rock opera)|Lifehouse]]'', was abandoned in favour of 1971's ''[[Who's Next]]''. The group subsequently released ''[[Quadrophenia]]'' (1973) and ''[[The Who by Numbers]]'' (1975), oversaw the [[Tommy (1975 film)|film adaptation of ''Tommy'']] and toured to large audiences before semi-retiring from live performance in 1977. The release of ''[[Who Are You]]'' in August 1978 was overshadowed by the death of Moon on 7 September, at the age of 32.\n\n[[Kenney Jones]], formerly of [[the Small Faces]] and [[the Faces]], replaced Moon and the group resumed touring. A [[Quadrophenia (film)|film adaptation of ''Quadrophenia'']] was released in 1979 along with the retrospective documentary ''[[The Kids Are Alright (film)|The Kids Are Alright]]''. The group continued recording, releasing ''[[Face Dances]]'' in 1981 and ''[[It's Hard]]'' the following year, before breaking up. They occasionally re-formed for live appearances such as [[Live Aid]] in 1985, a 25th anniversary tour in 1989 that drew mixed reviews, and for a tour of ''Quadrophenia'' in 1996. The Who resumed regular touring in 1999, with drummer [[Zak Starkey]], to a positive response, and were considering the possibility of a new album, but these plans were stalled by Entwistle's death in June 2002 at the age of 57. Townshend and Daltrey elected to continue as the Who, releasing ''[[Endless Wire (The Who album)|Endless Wire]]'' (2006), which reached the top ten in the UK and US. The group continue to play live on a regular basis, and in 2012 they began a further tour of ''Quadrophenia''.\n\n==History==\n\n===Background===\n[[File:TVU Campus St Marys Road.jpg|thumb|[[Pete Townshend]] attended [[Ealing Art College]] (''pictured in 2010''), and his experience there made a notable contribution to the Who's career]]\n\nThe three founding members of the Who, Daltrey, Townshend and Entwistle, all grew up in [[Acton, London]]. All three passed the [[Eleven Plus exam]] and went to [[Acton County Grammar School]].{{sfn|Marsh|1983|pp=13,19,24}} Townshend's father, Cliff, had played [[saxophone]] and his mother, Betty, had sung in the entertainment division of the [[RAF]] during [[World War II]],{{sfn|Marsh|1983|pp=15-16}} while Entwistle's father, Herbert, played [[trumpet]], and his mother, Queenie, played [[piano]].{{sfn|Marsh|1983|pp=24-25}} The pair became friends in the second year of Acton County, and formed a [[trad jazz]] group, the Confederates,{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=26}} while Entwistle also played [[french horn]] in the Middlesex Schools' Symphony Orchestra. However, both became influenced by the increasing popularity of [[rock 'n' roll]], with Townshend particularly admiring [[Cliff Richard]]'s debut single, \"[[Move It]]\".{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2009|p=17}} Entwistle had decided to move to guitar as his instrument of choice, but after struggling with it due to his large fingers, and on hearing the guitar work of [[Duane Eddy]], decided to move to the bass. He was unable to afford his own instrument and so built one at home.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=29}} Townshend and Entwistle both left school aged 16. Entwistle went to work with the [[Inland Revenue]], while Townshend started a course at [[Ealing Art College]],{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2009|p=20}} a move that he would subsequently describe as profoundly influential on the course of the Who.{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2009|p=22}}\n\nDaltrey, who was in the year above them, had moved to Acton from [[Shepherd's Bush]], a more working-class area. He had trouble fitting in as an outsider, and discovered gangs and rock 'n' roll.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=14}} He was expelled from school aged 15 and found work on a building site.{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2009|p=11}} Daltrey maintains that his subsequent musical career saved him from a dead-end working man's job,{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=14}} and in 1959 he started the band that would later evolve into the Who. The band, called the Detours, played professional gigs from the very beginning, such as corporate and wedding functions, with Daltrey keeping a close eye on the finances as well as the music.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=31}}\n\nDaltrey met Entwistle by chance on the street, telling him \"I hear you play bass\", which Entwistle subsequently said was strange \"considering I was carrying one without a case!\"{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2009|p=18}} In the summer of 1961, Entwistle suggested Townshend as an additional guitarist.{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2009|p=18}} In the early days of the Detours, the band played instrumentals by [[the Shadows]] and [[the Ventures]], as well as a variety of pop and trad jazz covers. The line-up consisted of Daltrey as lead guitarist, Townshend on rhythm guitar, Entwistle on bass, Harry Wilson on drums and Colin Dawson as vocalist.{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2009|p=19}} Daltrey was considered the leader of the group and, according to Townshend, \"ran things the way he wanted them.\"{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2009|p=22}} Wilson was fired in the summer of 1962 in preference to [[Doug Sandom]], who despite being significantly older than the rest of the band, and married, was a more accomplished musician, having been playing semi-professionally for two years at that point.{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2009|pp=19-20}} Dawson subsequently quit after arguing too much with Daltrey.{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2009|p=22}}\n\nWith the departure of Dawson, Daltrey moved to performing as lead vocalist, and Townshend, with Entwistle's encouragement, became the sole guitarist. Through Townshend's mother, the group obtained a management contract with local promoter Robert Druce,{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2009|p=21}} who started booking the band as a support act, and they became increasingly influenced by bands they were supporting, including [[Screaming Lord Sutch]], [[Cliff Bennett]] and the Rebel Rousers, [[Shane Fenton]] and the Fentones, and [[Johnny Kidd (singer)|Johnny Kidd]] and the Pirates. The Pirates in particular became a strong influence on the group since they also only had one guitarist, [[Mick Green]]. Green inspired Townshend to take up a combined rhythm and lead guitar style, while Entwistle's bass became more of a lead instrument.{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2009|p=24}} In February 1964, they became aware of the group Johnny Devlin and the Detours, so they decided to change their name.{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2009|p=26}} Townshend and his room-mate Richard Barnes spent a night considering potential names, focusing on a theme of joke announcements, including \"No One\" and \"The Group\". Townshend preferred \"the Hair\", while Barnes liked \"the Who\" because it \"had a pop punch\".{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=65}} Daltrey listened to suggestions the next morning and decided the Who was the best choice.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=66}}\n\n===1964\u20131978===\n\n====Early career====\n\nBy the time the Detours had evolved into the Who, they had already found regular gigs including the Oldfield Hotel in Greenford, the White Hart Hotel in Acton, the Goldhawk Social Club in Shepherd's Bush, and the Notre Dame Hall in Leicester Square.{{sfn|Fletcher|1998|p=68}} They had also replaced Druce as manager with Helmut Gorden, with whom they secured an audition with Chris Parmeinter for [[Fontana Records]].{{sfn|Fletcher|1998|p=70}} At the end of the audition, Parmeinter explained the drumming was a problem. Sandom claims that Townshend immediately turned on him and verbally assaulted him, threatening to fire him if his playing did not immediately improve. Sandom quit in disgust, but was persuaded to lend his kit to any potential stand-ins or replacements. Sandom and Townshend did not speak to each other again for 14 years.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=78-79}}\n\nDuring a gig in late April at the Oldfield, using a stand-in drummer, the band met Moon for the first time. Unlike the other members, Moon grew up in [[Wembley]], and had been drumming in bands since 1961.{{sfn|Fletcher|1998|p=29}} At the time he was performing with a semi-professional band called the Beachcombers, but wanted a full-time role.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=80}} Moon played a few songs with the group, breaking a bass drum pedal and tearing a drum skin in the process. The band were immediately impressed with his energy and enthusiasm, and offered him the job.{{sfn|Fletcher|1998|p=73}} Moon performed with the Beachcombers a few more times, but eventually a clash of dates occurred and he had no option but to devote himself full-time to the Who. The Beachcombers decided to audition Sandom as a replacement, believing his clashing with the rest of the Who to be the reason he left, but were unimpressed with his playing and passed on the offer.{{sfn|Fletcher|1998|p=80-81}}\n\nIn the summer, the Who switched management again to [[Peter Meaden]]. He decided that the group would be ideal to represent the growing [[mod (subculture)|mod]] movement in Britain which involved fashion, [[Scooter (motorcycle)|scooters]] and music genres such as [[rhythm and blues]], [[soul music|soul]], and [[beat music]]. He renamed the group the High Numbers, dressed them up in typical mod clothes,<ref name=\"eder\">{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-who-mn0000577627/biography|title=The Who&nbsp;\u2013 biography|first=Bruce|last=Eder|publisher=[[AllMusic]]|accessdate=19 September 2013}}</ref> secured a second, more favourable audition with Fontana and wrote the two sides for their single \"[[Zoot Suit/I'm the Face|Zoot Suit\"/\"I'm the Face]]\" as an attempt to appeal to mods. Meaden had in fact merely written the lyrics, as the tune for \"Zoot Suit\" was \"Misery\" by the Dynamics,<ref>{{cite book|title=Icons of Rock|publisher=ABC-CLIO|page=240|isbn=978-0-3133-3845-8}}</ref> while \"I'm the Face\" borrowed from Slim Harpo's \"[[Got Love If You Want It]]\".{{sfn|Fletcher|1998|p=91-92}} Although Meaden attempted to promote the single, it failed to reach the top 50{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2009|p=54}} and the band reverted to calling themselves the Who.{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2009|p=60}}\n\nMeaden was replaced as manager by two filmmakers, [[Kit Lambert]] and [[Chris Stamp]]. They were looking for a young, unsigned rock group that they could make a film about,<ref name=\"kurutz\">{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/kit-lambert-mn0000080966|title=Kit Lambert&nbsp;\u2013 Biography|first=Steve|last=Kurutz|publisher=AllMusic|accessdate=19 September 2013}}</ref> and had seen the band playing at the Railway Hotel in [[Wealdstone]], which had become a regular venue for them.{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2009|p=55}}<ref>The Railway burned down in 2002,[http://www.carlolittle.com/hot/fire.JPG Christian Duffin: \"Fire destroys the home of rock legends\"], and later became blocks of flats named after members of the band.{{cite web |url= http://www.pastscape.org.uk/hob.aspx?hob_id=1440043 |title=Pastscape&nbsp;\u2013 Detailed Result: THE RAILWAY HOTEL  |work=pastscape.org.uk  |accessdate=25 August 2013}}</ref> Lambert found affinity with Townshend in particular, due to his art school background, and encouraged him to write songs.<ref name=\"kurutz\"/> In August, Lambert and Stamp filmed a promotional film featuring the group and their audience at the Railway.{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2009|p=56}} To highlight their music style, the band changed their set towards soul, [[rhythm and blues]] and [[Motown]] covers, and created the slogan \"''Maximum R&B''\".<ref name=\"eder\"/>\n\nIn June 1964, during a performance at the Railway, Townshend accidentally broke the head of his guitar on the low ceiling above the stage.<ref name=\"Railway Hotel\">[http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/49292974/ns/today-books/t/who-i-am-rock-icon-pete-townshend-tells-his-story/ \"'Who I Am': Rock icon Pete Townshend tells his story\"].

Townshend had written a song, \"[[I Can't Explain]]\", that deliberately sounded like the Kinks to attract Talmy's attention. Talmy saw the group in rehearsals and was immediately impressed. He signed the group to his production company,{{sfn|Howard|2004|pp=106-107}} and sold the recording to the US arm of [[Decca Records]], which meant that the group's early singles were released in Britain on [[Brunswick Records]], one of UK Decca's labels for US artists.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=151-152}}\n\nThe Who achieved a major boost in popularity when they appeared on the television programme ''[[Ready Steady Go!]]''<ref name=\"eder\"/> Lambert and Stamp had been given the task of finding \"typical teens\", and simply invited the group's regular audience from the Goldhawk Social Club.<ref name=\"carr\">{{cite AV media notes|title=The Kids are Alright (soundtrack)|publisher=Polydor|year=1979|first=Roy|last=Carr}}</ref> Their enthusiastic reception on television, aided by regular airplay on [[pirate radio]] stations such as [[Radio Caroline]],{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=152}} helped the single slowly climb the charts during early 1965, eventually reaching the top 10.<ref name=\"Roberts\"/> For the follow-up single, \"[[Anyway, Anyhow, Anywhere]]\", credited to both Townshend and Daltrey,<ref name=\"Roberts\"/> Talmy arranged the deliberate use of guitar [[audio feedback|feedback]], which was so unconventional that the US arm of Decca rejected the master tapes. The single also reached the top 10 in the UK.{{sfn|Howard|2004|pp=107-108}}\n\nThe transition into a hit-making band with original material, eagerly encouraged by Lambert, did not sit well with Daltrey, particularly after a session of recording R&B covers for an album was shelved.{{sfn|Fletcher|1998|p=121}} The Who were not particularly good friends either, with the notable exception of Moon and Entwistle, who enjoyed clubbing together.{{sfn|Fletcher|1998|p=126}} The group experienced a particularly fraught time when touring Denmark in September, which culminated in Daltrey throwing Moon's [[amphetamine]]s down the toilet and physically assaulting him. Immediately on returning to Britain, Daltrey was sacked from the Who.{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2009|p=93}} After a band meeting, he was reinstated on the strict condition that the group became a democracy without his dominant leadership. At the same time, the group enlisted [[Richard Cole]] as a roadie.{{sfn|Fletcher|1998|pp=130-132}}\n\nThe group recorded a follow-up single, \"[[My Generation]]\", in October. Townshend had written it as a slow blues, but after several abortive attempts, it was turned into a more powerful song with a bass solo from Entwistle.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=182}} It became the highest charting single the group have achieved to date, reaching number 2.<ref name=\"charlesworth\">{{cite AV media notes |title=Live At Leeds (1995 CD reissue)|others=The Who|year=1995|first=Chris|last=Charlesworth|type=CD|publisher=[[Polydor]]|id=527-169-2|location=UK}}</ref>{{rp|12}} The debut album ''[[My Generation (album)|My Generation]]'' (''The Who Sings My Generation'' in the US) was released in late 1965. It included original material written by Townshend, including the title track and \"[[The Kids Are Alright (song)|The Kids Are Alright]]\", as well as several [[James Brown]] covers that Daltrey favoured, from the aborted session earlier that year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/the-who-sings-my-generation-mw0000020578|title=My Generation&nbsp;\u2013 review|first=Richie|last=Unterberger|publisher=AllMusic|accessdate=19 September 2013}}</ref>\n\nAfter ''My Generation'', the Who fell out with Talmy, which meant an abrupt end to their recording contract. Lambert and Stamp claimed the royalty rate was poor,{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=199}} while Talmy claimed it was due to Lambert wanting to take control of the recordings away from him. The resulting legal acrimony resulted in Talmy holding the rights to the master tapes, which prevented the album from being reissued. The dispute was finally resolved in 2002, when it saw a proper remix and CD reissue.{{sfn|Howard|2004|p=108}}  Meanwhile, the Who were signed to [[Robert Stigwood]]'s Reaction Label, releasing \"[[Substitute (The Who song)|Substitute]]\". Talmy took legal action over the B-side, \"Instant Party\", and so the single was withdrawn and replaced with \"Waltz for a Pig\", recorded by the [[Graham Bond|Graham Bond Organisation]] under the pseudonym \"the Who Orchestra\".{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=203}}\n\nSubsequent singles released in 1966 included \"[[I'm a Boy]]\", about a boy dressed as a girl, taken from an abortive collection of songs called \"Quads\",{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=217}} \"[[Happy Jack (song)|Happy Jack]]\",{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2009|p=109}} and an EP, ''[[Ready Steady Who]]'', that tied in with their regular appearances on ''Ready Steady Go!''{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=218}}\n\n====''A Quick One'' and ''The Who Sell Out''====\n[[File:Roger Daltrey -left and Keith Moon-right 1967.jpg|thumb|left|Roger Daltrey and Keith Moon, 1967]]\n\nTo alleviate some of the financial pressure on the band, Lambert arranged a songwriting deal which required each member to write two songs for the next album. Entwistle contributed \"[[Boris the Spider]]\" and \"Whiskey Man\" and found a niche role as second songwriter,{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=225}} but after recording the material, they found they needed to fill an extra ten minutes. Lambert encouraged Townshend to write a longer piece, which became \"[[A Quick One, While He's Away]]\". The album was subsequently titled ''[[A Quick One]]''{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=227}} (released as ''Happy Jack'' in the US),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/a-quick-one-happy-jack-mw0000197244|title=A Quick One (Happy Jack)|first=Ritchie|last=Unterberger|publisher=AllMusic|accessdate=24 September 2013}}</ref> and reached number 4 in the charts.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=229}} It was followed in 1967 by the UK Top 5 single \"[[Pictures of Lily]].\"{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2009|p=420}}\n\nBy 1966, ''Ready Steady Go!'' had stopped being broadcast, and mod was no longer as popular. The Who found themselves in competition with [[Cream (band)|Cream]] and [[the Jimi Hendrix Experience]] on the London gigging circuit.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|po=239-240}} Lambert and Stamp realised that commercial success in the US was paramount to the group's future, and so arranged a deal with promoter [[Frank Barsalona]] for a short package tour in New York.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=243}} The group's performances, which still involved smashing guitars and kicking over drums, were well received,{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=247}} and led to them being on the bill at the [[Monterey Pop Festival]], which was their first major appearance in the US. Immediately afterwards, the group toured the country with [[Herman's Hermits]].{{sfn|Fletcher|1998|p=189}} Moon by this point had also attracted a reputation of destroying hotel rooms while on tour,{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=247}} with a particular interest in explosions, which was evident when the group appeared on ''[[The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour]]'' where he detonated his drum kit.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=276}}\n\nThe next album was ''[[The Who Sell Out]]''\u2014a [[concept album]] based on pirate radio, which had been instrumental in raising the Who's popularity, but had been banned that August.

The album became their most successful among critics and fans, reaching No.&nbsp;4 in the US pop charts and No.&nbsp;1 in the UK. Two tracks from the album, \"[[Baba O'Riley]]\" and \"[[Won't Get Fooled Again]]\", are early examples of synthesizer use in rock music; both tracks' keyboard sounds were generated in real time by a [[Lowrey organ]], and on \"Won't Get Fooled Again\", it was further processed through a [[VCS3]] synthesizer.{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2009|p=275}}\nTownshend was credited with \"VCS3 Organ\" and \"ARP Synthesizer\" on the final album credits. \"Baba O'Riley\" also featured a violin solo by [[Dave Arbus]], produced by Moon.<ref>{{cite AV media notes|title=Who's Next|others=The Who|publisher=Track Records|id=2408 102|year=1971}}</ref>\n\nThe Who continued to issue ''Lifehouse''-related material over the next few years.

Having been continually touring since the band started, there was no group activity for the first part of 1972.{{sfn|Fletcher|1998|p=302}} They then started recording new material, but the results were uninspired, and the sessions were abandoned. Tensions began to emerge between the group members\u2014Townshend believed Daltrey just wanted a money-making band; Daltrey, conversely, thought Townshend's projects were getting pretentious. In addition, Moon's behaviour was becoming increasingly destructive and problematic.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=390-91}} Daltrey had also discovered that Lambert and Stamp had left significant amounts of money unaccounted for, and believed them to be no longer effective as managers, which Townshend and Moon disputed.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=406}} Following a short [[The Who Tour 1972|European tour]], the remainder of 1972 was spent working on an orchestral version of ''Tommy'', with Daltrey and Townshend collaborating with [[Lou Reizner]].{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=401}}\n\nBy 1973, the Who had decided to record an album about mod and its subculture, set against clashes with [[Rockers (youth movement)|Rockers]] in the early 1960s in the UK, particularly at [[Brighton]], called ''[[Quadrophenia]]''.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=412-413}} The story is about a boy named Jimmy, who undergoes a personality crisis, and his relationship with his family and the mod culture.{{sfn|Fletcher|1998|p=341,344}} By the time the album was being recorded, relationships between the band and Lambert and Stamp had broken down irreparably, and [[Bill Curbishley]] replaced them as manager.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=412}} Townshend played a variety of multi-tracked synthesizers, and Entwistle played several overdubbed horn parts.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=414}} The album became their highest charting cross-Atlantic success, peaking at No.&nbsp;2 in the UK and US.{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2009|p=428}}\n\nThe tour for the album started in [[Stoke on Trent]] in October,{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2009|pp=335-336}} but was immediately beset with problems. Having successfully played \"Baba O'Riley\" and \"Won't Get Fooled Again\" to a backing tape with the synthesizer parts live, Townshend had assembled a variety of similar tapes for ''Quadrophenia'' for the band to play along to. Unfortunately, the technology was not sophisticated enough to deal with the demands of the music, and rehearsals were interrupted due to an argument which culminated in Daltrey punching Townshend and knocking him out cold.{{sfn|Fletcher|1998|p=359}} At a gig in Newcastle, the tapes completely malfunctioned, and an enraged Townshend physically dragged soundman [[Bob Pridden]] onstage, screamed verbal abuse at him, kicked all the amps over and partially destroyed the backing tapes. The show was abandoned in place of an \"oldies\" set, at the end of which Townshend smashed his guitar and Moon kicked over his drumkit.{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2009|p=336}}{{sfn|Fletcher|1998|p=359}} The US tour started on 20 November at the [[Cow Palace]], [[Daly City, California]], where Moon passed out during \"Won't Get Fooled Again\" and, after a break backstage, again in \"[[Magic Bus (song)|Magic Bus]]\". Townshend asked the audience, \"Can anyone play the drums?\u2014I mean somebody good.\" An audience member, [[Scot Halpin]], filled in for the rest of the show.{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2009|p=337}} After a show in [[Montreal]], the band (except for Daltrey, who retired to bed early) caused so much destruction to their hotel room, that the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police|Canadian Mounted Police]] were called, and they were arrested.{{sfn|Fletcher|1998|p=363}}\n\n[[File:The Who (1974).png|left|thumb|The Who in 1974]]\nBy 1974, work had begun in earnest on [[Tommy (1975 film)|the ''Tommy'' film]].

A settlement was reached, but, feeling upset and disillusioned, he went to the [[Speakeasy]] where he bumped into [[the Sex Pistols]]' Steve Jones and Paul Cook, who were fans of the Who. After leaving the club, he passed out in a doorway, where a policeman claimed he would not be arrested if he could stand and walk. The events inspired the title track of the next album, ''[[Who Are You]]''.{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2009|p=396}}\n\nThe group reconvened in September 1977, when Townshend announced there would be no live performances for the immediate future, a decision that Daltrey endorsed. By this point, Moon was so out of shape that the Who conceded it would be difficult for him to cope with touring. The only live gig performed that year was an informal show at the [[Gaumont State Cinema]] in [[Kilburn, London|Kilburn]], London, on 15 December, as part of an upcoming documentary film about the band, ''[[The Kids Are Alright (film)|The Kids Are Alright]]''.{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2009|p=406}} Having not played for 14 months, the band was weak. Moon's playing was particularly lacklustre and he had gained a lot of weight. Further filming was shelved.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=494}}\n\nRecording of ''Who Are You'' started in January 1978. Daltrey clashed with Johns over the production of his vocals, and Moon's drumming was so poor that Daltrey and Entwistle considered he should be sacked. His playing subsequently improved, but on one track, \"Music Must Change\", he was absent entirely.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=496}} In May, the Who were required to film another performance at Shepperton Sound Studios in May for ''The Kids Are Alright'', due to the poor performance at Kilburn.

The original group played a mixture of [[trad jazz]] and contemporary pop hits as the Detours, which evolved into R&B during 1963{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2009|pp=22,26}} and then to mod the following year.{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2009|pp=38-39}} A distinctive part of the original band's sound was Entwistle's lead bass playing, while Townshend concentrated on rhythm and chords.{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2009|p=24}} Entwistle's bass has been described as displaying \"the strong influence of Rhythm and Blues\".{{sfn|Campbell|2012|p=239}} Moon's arrival in the band further strengthened this reversal of traditional rock instrumentation, frequently playing lead parts on his drumkit.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=88}}\n\nThe group became pioneering users of the [[Marshall Stack]]. This arose from Townshend perceiving himself to be less technical than contemporary guitarists such as [[Eric Clapton]] and [[Jeff Beck]] and deciding to stand out visually instead. Entwistle was the first member to get two 4x12 [[Instrument amplifier#Standard amp|speaker cabinets]], quickly followed by Townshend. The group quickly integrated [[audio feedback|feedback]] as an integral part of the guitar sound.{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2009|p=43}} Moon stopped using the [[hi hat]] in 1966, and started using [[Premier]] drumkits on an exclusive basis.{{sfn|Fletcher|1998|p=152}}\n\nLike several other contemporary musicians, the group were influenced by the arrival of [[Jimi Hendrix]], particularly after the Who and the [[The Jimi Hendrix Experience|Experience]] met at Monterey. Fletcher described the latter as \"so much better than the Who it was embarrassing\".{{sfn|Fletcher|1998|p=189}} This, combined with lengthy touring, strengthened the band's sound. In the studio, they began to develop softer pieces, particularly on ''Tommy'' onwards, albeit with Moon's distinctive drumming.{{sfn|Fletcher|1998|p=232}} At the same time, they grew out of being a singles band to an album band, creating more than mere three-minute pop songs.{{sfn|Campbell|2012|p=239}} In the early 1970s, the band's sound developed to include [[synthesizer]]s, particularly on ''Quadrophenia'',{{sfn|Atkins|2000|p=177}} but by ''By Numbers'' the style had scaled back to more standard rock.{{sfn|Atkins|2000|p=222}}\n\nUnlike several other major rock acts, the Who have featured prominent [[backing vocals]] within the group. After \"I Can't Explain\" used session men to sing backing vocals, Townshend and Entwistle resolved to do better themselves on subsequent releases, producing strong [[falsetto]] harmonies.<ref>{{cite book|title=Please Please Me : Sixties British Pop, Inside Out: Sixties British Pop, Inside Out|first=Gordon|last=Thompson|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2008|page=95|isbn=978-0-1997-1555-8}}</ref> Daltrey, Townshend and Entwistle all sang lead on various songs, with Moon joining in for the occasional number. ''Who's Next'' featured Daltrey and Townshend sharing the lead vocal on several songs, and biographer Dave Marsh considers the contrast between Daltrey's strong, guttural vocal and Townshend's higher and more gentle voice to be one of the album's highlights.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=386}}\n\n==Legacy and influence==\n[[File:Pete Townshend Windmill-(jha).jpg|thumb|left|165px|Pete Townshend does the [[guitar showmanship#Pete Townshend|windmill]] in 1976]]\n\nThe Who are one of the most influential rock groups of the 1960s and 1970s.<ref name=\"Britannica vid\">{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/642975/the-Who|title=The Who|publisher=Britannica Online Encyclopedia|accessdate=16 May 2008}}</ref> The group has been credited with originating the \"[[rock opera]]\"<ref name=\"Britannica vid\"/> and it made one of the first notable [[concept albums]].
