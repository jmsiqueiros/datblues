Handy Award]] for 'Best New Blues Artist'.<ref name=\"AMG\"/>\n\n==Biography==\nWeathersby spent his early years in [[Meadville, Mississippi]], a place he still considers home, although when he was aged eight, his family moved to [[East Chicago, Indiana]].<ref name=\"AMG\"/>\n\n===Pre-musician years (1953-1979)===\nAs a teenager, Weathersby began to learn the guitar. One day, after practicing \"[[Crosscut Saw (song)|Cross Cut Saw]]\" many times through, he decided to show his father. After he finished playing it, his father's friend, a man Weathersby knew as Albert, the diesel mechanic, said, \"Man, that ain't the way that song goes, that ain't the way I played it.\" The mechanic turned out to be [[Albert King]], who then showed Weathersby how to play it. Despite Weathersby's mistake, King was impressed and eventually signed Weathersby on to play rhythm guitar with him on tour.<ref name=\"AMG\"/>\n\nHowever his career as musician started many years later. Before then, Weathersby worked many jobs ranging from steel mill worker to prison guard and police man. He also served in the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] from 1971 to 1977, during the [[Vietnam War]].<ref name=\"AMG\"/>\n\n===Collaborative years (1979-1995)===\nAfter the Vietnam War, Weathersby began playing rhythm guitar with Albert King. It was only on short road trips between 1979\u201381,<ref name=\"AMG\"/> but the experience solidified Weathersby's identity as a blues musician.\n\nHe then started filling in for the guitarist of the Sons of Blues, [[Carlos Johnson (blues musician)|Carlos Johnson]], who Weathersby described as \"a pretty shaky guy, you know. He could show up just as easy as he couldn't show up...\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bluesmusicnow.com/weathersby2.html |title=Carl Weathersby, Part 2 |publisher=Bluesmusicnow.com |date= |accessdate=28 March 2013}}</ref> Eventually the band hired Weathersby on as their full-time guitarist, a position he held for the next fifteen years.\n\n===Solo years (1995-present)===\nHis position as guitarist for the Sons of Blues earned him a name among the blues [[fan (person)|fans]] of Chicago, it also left him feeling discontent.\n\nBecause of his growing popularity, Evidence Records released Weathersby's first album, ''Don't Lay Your Blues on Me'' (1996).<ref name=\"AMG\"/> They published all of his subsequent albums, up to ''Best of Carl Weathersby''.  His only [[live album]], ''In the House'', was recorded at the Lucerne Blues Festival in [[Switzerland]], when he was joined by the [[harmonica|harp]] player and past band mate Billy Branch. ''In The House'' was released under the [[CrossCut Records|CrossCut]] [[record label]].
