After leaving the Nighthawks in 1986, Thackery toured under his own name.\n\nBorn in Pittsburgh and raised in Washington, Thackery co-founded The Nighthawks with Mark Wenner in 1972 and went on to record over twenty albums with them. In 1986 he began touring with The Assassins, a six-piece original blues, rock and R&B ensemble which he had previously helped start as a vacation band when The Nighthawks took one of their rare breaks. Originally billed as Jimmy Thackery and The Assassins, the band toured the U.S. Northeast, [[Mid-Atlantic States|Mid-Atlantic]], South, and [[Texas]] regions. The Assassins released a variety of recordings on the Seymour record label, two on vinyl (''No Previous Record'' and ''Partners in Crime'') and the 1989 [[Compact disc|CD]] ''Cut Me Loose.''\n\nIn the wake of the Assassins 1991 break-up, Thackery has been leading a trio, Jimmy Thackery and the Drivers, whose early recordings were for the [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]], [[California]] based [[Blind Pig Records]]. In 2002 Thackery released, ''We Got It'', his first album on [[Telarc International Corporation|Telarc]] and in 2006, ''In the Natural State'' with [[Cate Brothers|Earl and Ernie Cate]] on [[Rykodisc]]. In 2007, he released ''Solid Ice'' again with The Drivers.<ref>{{cite news | first=Doug | last=Levine | coauthors= |authorlink= | title=Jimmy Thackery Showcases Songwriting, Guitar Playing Skills on 'Solid Ice' | date=1 August 2007 | publisher=Voice of America | url =http://www.voanews.com/english/archive/2007-08/2007-08-01-voa9.cfm | work =VOA News | pages = | accessdate = 1 January 2009 | language = }} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> His latest album 'Feel the Heat' was released in April 2011.\n\n==Discography==\n* 1992 ''Empty Arms Motel''\n* 1993 ''Sideways in Paradise'' (with [[John Mooney (musician)|John Mooney]])\n* 1994 ''Trouble Man''\n* 1995 ''Wild Night Out''\n* 1996 ''Drive To Survive''\n* 1996 ''Partners in Crime'' (with [[Tom Principato]])\n* 1998 ''Switching Gears''\n* 2000 ''Sinner Street''\n* 2000 ''That\u00b4s It!''
