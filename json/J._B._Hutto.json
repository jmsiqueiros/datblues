Hutto was influenced by [[Elmore James]], and became known for his [[slide guitar]] work and declamatory style of singing.  He was inducted into the [[Blues Hall of Fame]] two years after his death.\n\n==Life and career==\n'''Joseph Benjamin Hutto''' was born in [[Blackville, South Carolina]], the fifth of seven children.  His family moved to [[Augusta, Georgia]] when Hutto was three years old.  His father, Calvin, was a preacher and Hutto, along with his three brothers and three sisters, formed a gospel group called The Golden Crowns, singing in local churches.  Hutto's father died in 1949, and the family relocated to Chicago.<ref>Rowe 1981, p. 114</ref>  Hutto served as a draftee in the Korean War in the early 1950s, driving trucks in combat zones.<ref>van Rijn 2004, p. 97</ref>\n\nIn Chicago, Hutto took up the drums and played with Johnny Ferguson and his Twisters.  He also tried the piano before settling on the guitar and playing on the streets with the percussionist Eddie 'Porkchop' Hines.  After adding Joe Custom on second guitar, they started playing club gigs, and harmonica player George Mayweather joined after sitting in with the band.  Hutto named his band The Hawks, after the wind that blows in Chicago.<ref>Rowe 1981, p. 114-5</ref>  A recording session in 1954 resulted in the release of two singles on the [[Chance Records|Chance]] label and a second session later the same year, with the band supplemented by pianist [[Little Johnny Jones (pianist)|Johnny Jones]], produced a third.<ref>Ledbitter and Slaven 1987, p. 650</ref>\n\nLater in the 1950s Hutto became disenchanted with music, and gave it up after a woman broke his guitar over her husband's head one night in a club where he was performing; during the next eleven years Hutto worked as a janitor in a funeral home to supplement his income.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cascadeblues.org/History/JBHutto.htm |title=J.B.
