Lang's music is notable for both his unusual voice, which at 13 was compared to that of a 40-year-old blues veteran,<ref name=\"living\">Hagbergh, Amy Hammond. [http://www.livinglightnews.org/story3_05.06.htm ''Total Turn Around'']. Living Light News. 2006.</ref> and for his [[guitar]] solos. His solo patterns have especially been noted{{who|date=June 2013}} for his frequent use of wide [[vibrato]]s.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} He has five albums that charted on the top 50 of the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart and has won a [[Grammy Award]] for ''Turn Around''.\n\n==Biography==\nJonny Lang was born in [[Fargo, North Dakota]], USA. He started playing the guitar at the age of twelve. He got his start playing guitar for his friends on the Vallager's porch at their lake place. He would play everything from modern hits to the classics; even performing an astounding rendition of Jimi Hendrix's take on the National Anthem that gave the campground security reasoning to pause, and not interrupt him. After his father took him to see the Bad Medicine Blues Band, one of the few blues bands in Fargo. Lang soon started taking guitar lessons from Ted Larsen, the band's guitar player. Several months after Lang began, he joined the band, which was then renamed Kid Jonny Lang & The Big Bang.\n\nThe band moved to Minneapolis, Minnesota, and independently released the album ''Smokin''' when Lang was fourteen. Lang was signed to A&M Records in 1996. He released the critically acclaimed multi-platinum ''Lie to Me'' on January 28, 1997. The next album, ''Wander this World'', was released on October 20, 1998 and earned a Grammy nomination. This was followed by the more soulful ''Long Time Coming'' on October 14, 2003. Lang also made a cover of [[Edgar Winter]]'s \"Dying to Live\". Lang's 2006 album, the gospel-influenced ''Turn Around'', won him his first Grammy Award.\n\nIn his earliest performing years, Lang always performed [[barefoot]] on stage, because \"it feels good\" and once in tribute to [[Luther Allison]], a friend who had recently died. He has since given up that practice, after several near-accidents and electric shocks.\n\nIn more than ten years on the road, Lang has toured with [[the Rolling Stones]], [[Buddy Guy]], [[Aerosmith]], [[B.B. King]], [[Blues Traveler]], [[Jeff Beck]] and [[Sting (musician)|Sting]]. In 1999, he was invited to play for a White House audience including President and Mrs. Clinton. Earlier that year he was selected by the newly elected Minnesota Governor Jesse Ventura to perform at his Inaugural Ball.  Lang also makes a cameo appearance in the film ''[[Blues Brothers 2000]]'' as a janitor. In 2004, Eric Clapton asked Lang to play at the [[Crossroads Guitar Festival]] to raise money for the Crossroads Centre Antigua.\n\nLang also appears regularly as a part of the Experience Hendrix Tour along with many other well-known guitarists to pay tribute the deceased guitar legend.\n\n==Musical equipment==\nJonny Lang originally used Benedict guitars but now mainly uses a [[Fender Telecaster Thinline]] made by the Fender Custom Shop. He also uses one of two Jonny Lang Signature Series Gibson Les Pauls he owns for some occasions. The Telecaster Thinline has a Spruce body, maple top and birdseye maple neck. He uses [[Bill Lawrence (guitar maker)|Bill Lawrence]] Pickups (500L Neck, 500XL Bridge) and a [[Seymour Duncan]] P-90 in the middle. He uses a Route 66 pedal of Visual Sound and a Vox 847 reissue Wah Wah pedal for some songs. Live, he plays through a pair of modified Fender Deluxe Reverb Reissue Amps. Jonny also used an arbiter Fuzz Face and an Electro Harmonix POG for The Experience Hendrix tour. Lang has also used Audiotech Guitar Products ABC Selector CCM on his 2005 acoustic tour.\n\n{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}}\n\nThe Fender Telecaster featured on the cover of ''Lie to Me'' is in fact not a Telecaster at all, but an original Fender Esquire.  Upon filming the music video for the title track \"Lie to Me\" which took place in a San Francisco music store, the owner of the store suggested Jonny play the Esquire in the video.  Jonny fell in love with the guitar and it was purchased and given to him as a gift.  He continues to use it, but not as often as his Custom Shop Telecaster and Signature Series Les Paul.\n\n{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}}\n\n==Band personnel==\nFrom 1993 to 1996, Lang's backing band was The Big Bang. This group consisted of three founding members of the Bad Medicine Blues Band: Ted \"Lightnin' Boy\" Larsen on guitar, his brother Michael Rey Larsen on drums, and Jeff Hayenga on bass. Keyboardist Bruce McCabe joined The Big Bang in 1995 after Lang and this young band from Fargo impressed him with their set opening for McCabe's band at the time, The Hoopsnakes.\n\nFrom 1996 to 2004, Lang's backing band included Paul Diethelm on guitar, Bruce McCabe on keyboards, Doug Nelson on bass and Billy Thommes on drums. Also appearing on keyboards during 2003 and 2004 was Donnie La Marca, filling in for McCabe during his break from touring. Nelson was killed in a traffic accident in 2000 and was replaced by [[Billy Franze]]. Franze was in turn replaced by [[James Anton|Jim Anton]] in 2003. Saxophone player David Eiland was added in 2000, providing Lang with a foil for extended instrumental jams. In 2005, Lang replaced the entire lineup, except for Anton, and embarked on an acoustic tour. He performed with [[Wendy Alane Wright]] at the 2000 pre-Grammy party. Guitarist [[Reeve Carney]] was the band's opening act for several shows in 2005, as well as for the 2006 and 2007 tours. The new band also includes organist and [[Houston, Texas|Houston]], [[Texas]] native Charles Jones, drummer Barry Alexander, and organist [[Bill Brown (organist)|Bill Brown]] from Minneapolis.\n\nThe current band line up includes:\n*Barry Alexander from Minneapolis, MN on drums\n*James Anton from Minneapolis, MN on bass\n*Akil Thompson from Nashville, TN on rhythm guitar\n*Dwan Hill from Nashville, TN on keys\n*Missi Hale from Los Angeles, CA on background vocals\n\n==New album==\nOn September 17, 2013 Lang released his first studio album in seven years, ''Fight for My Soul''. He released a single from the album, through ''USA Today'', called \"Blew Up (The House)\".{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}} The album was be released on September 2 in the UK and Europe.{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}} He will also tour the United States and Europe promoting his new album.{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}}\n\n==Personal life==\nLang married Haylie Johnson on June 8, 2001. Lang and his wife share the same birthday, although she is one year older. They live in [[Los Angeles, California]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}}\n\nLang has two older sisters, Stephanie and Heidi Jo.
