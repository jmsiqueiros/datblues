King]], he was determined to become a blues [[guitarist]]. In 1975, he played with the Haygood Band while attending Emory near Atlanta. Two years later, already an accomplished musician, he returned to Atlanta and joined his first band, The Alley Cats, a group that included Preston Hubbard of [[The Fabulous Thunderbirds]]<ref name=\"AMG\"/> and Mike Marinelli, saxophonist who was a [[Berklee College of Music]] woodwind instructor. Ellis graduated from [[Emory University]] in 1979 with a degree in history. In 1981 he formed The Heartfixers, with the [[singer]] and [[harmonica]] player [[Chicago Bob Nelson]].<ref name=\"russell\">{{cite book\n| first= Tony\n| last= Russell\n| year= 1997\n| title= The Blues - From [[Robert Johnson (musician)|Robert Johnson]] to [[Robert Cray]]\n| edition= \n| publisher=Carlton Books Limited \n| location= Dubai\n| pages= 109\u2013110\n| isbn= 1-85868-255-X}}</ref> The group [[recorded]] three albums for the small Landslide [[record label]], one with the singer, [[Nappy Brown]] before breaking up in 1988.<ref name=\"russell\"/> In 1988 Ellis signed a [[recording contract]] with Chicago\u2019s [[Alligator Records]].<ref name=\"russell\"/>  According to ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'', \u201cnobody has released more consistently excellent blues albums than Atlanta\u2019s Tinsley Ellis.
