The son of record producer [[John H. Hammond]], he is sometimes referred to as \"'''John Hammond, Jr.'''\".\n\n==Background==\nHammond is a son of the famed record producer and talent scout [[John H. Hammond|John Henry Hammond, Jr.]] and his first wife, Jemison McBride, an actress. He is a descendant of [[Cornelius Vanderbilt]], founder of the prominent [[Vanderbilt family]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Prial|first1=Dunstan|title=The Producer: John Hammond and the Soul of American Music|publisher=Macmillan|year=2007|pages=5\u201310, 186|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=OLO0sRm_dsEC&printsec=frontcover&dq=john+hammond&hl=en&ei=hK6jTcHTGMTcgQfN5ZyaCg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CC4Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=commodore%20vanderbilt&f=false|accessdate=2011-11-25}}</ref> He has a brother, Jason, and by his father's second marriage to Esme O'Brien Sarnoff, he has a stepsister, (Esme) Rosita Sarnoff. Hammond's middle name, Paul, is in honor of a friend of his father, the actor [[Paul Robeson]]. However, the younger Hammond was raised by his mother and only saw his father a few times a year while growing up.\n\nHe began playing guitar in high school, partially inspired by the album ''[[Jimmy Reed at Carnegie Hall]]''. He attended [[Antioch College]] for one year, but dropped out to pursue a music career. By the mid-1960s he was touring nationally and living in [[Greenwich Village]]. He befriended and recorded with many electric blues musicians in New York, including [[Jimi Hendrix]], [[Eric Clapton]], The Hawks (later known as [[The Band]]), [[Dr. John]] and [[Duane Allman]].\n\n==Career==\nHammond usually plays acoustically, choosing [[National Reso-Phonic Guitars]] and sings in a [[boogie-woogie|barrelhouse]] style. Since 1962, when he made his debut on [[Vanguard Records]], Hammond has made thirty-four [[album]]s. In the 1990s he began recording on the [[Point Blank Records]] label. Hammond has earned one [[Grammy Award]] and been nominated for four others. He also provided the [[soundtrack]] for the 1970 [[film]], ''[[Little Big Man (film)|Little Big Man]]'', starring [[Dustin Hoffman]].\n\nAlthough critically acclaimed, Hammond has received only moderate commercial success. Nonetheless, he enjoys a strong fan base and has earned respect from the likes of [[John Lee Hooker]], [[Roosevelt Sykes]], [[Duane Allman]], [[Willy Deville]], [[Robbie Robertson]] and [[Charlie Musselwhite]], all of whom have contributed their musical talents to Hammond's [[gramophone record|records]]. In addition, he is the only person who ever had both [[Eric Clapton]] and [[Jimi Hendrix]] in his [[band (music)|band]] at the same time, if only for five days in the 1960s when Hammond played [[The Gaslight Cafe]] in [[New York City]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Forman|first=Bill |date=January 28, 2010|url=http://www.csindy.com/colorado/tangled-up-in-blues/Content?oid=1591758 |title=Tangled up in blues: John Hammond recalls his meetings with Clapton, Hendrix, Dylan and Waits |publisher=''[[Colorado Springs Independent]]''}}</ref> To his regret, they never recorded together. It has been suggested by at least one author that Hammond deserves some credit for helping boost [[The Band]] to wider recognition. He recorded with several of the members of The Band in 1965, and recommended them to [[Bob Dylan]], with whom they undertook a [[Electric Dylan controversy|famed and tumultuous world tour]].<ref>{{cite book | last = Heylin | first = Clinton | title = Behind the Shades Revisited | publisher = HarperCollins | year = 2003 | location = New York | pages = 173\u2013174 | isbn = 0-06-052569-X}}</ref>\n[[File:John Hammond JR.jpg|thumb|left|240px|right|Hammond performing in the 1980s]]\nIn the early part of the 1990s, Hammond hosted the 1991 UK television documentary ''[[The Search for Robert Johnson]]'', detailing the life of the legendary Delta [[bluesman]], [[Robert Johnson (musician)|Robert Johnson]].\n\nHammond has had a longstanding friendship with the songwriter [[Tom Waits]], and has performed Waits' songs on occasion. In  2001, he released ''Wicked Grin'', an album entirely of Tom Waits compositions with one exception, the traditional [[Spiritual (music)|spiritual]], \"I Know I've Been Changed.\"  Waits himself provided guitar work and [[backing vocalist|backing vocals]] as well as producing the project.\n\nIn 2002, he released ''Ready for Love'', produced by [[David Hidalgo]] of [[Los Lobos]] fame.<ref name=\"barnes\"/>  It included a [[cover version]] of the [[Mick Jagger]] and [[Keith Richards]] penned, \"[[The Spider and the Fly (song)|The Spider and the Fly]]\".\n\nHis most recent album, entitled ''Rough and Tough'' was released in 2009. The album was a 2010 nominee for the [[Grammy Award for Best Traditional Blues Album]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=7466075 |author=Simon, Scott |title=John Hammond, Writing the Blues|work=Weekend Edition Saturday|publisher=NPR.org|date=February 17, 2007|format=Flash streaming audio}}</ref>\n\nIn 2011, Hammond was inducted into the [[Blues Hall of Fame]] of the [[Blues Foundation]].<ref>[http://www.blues.org/halloffame/inductees.php?YearId=34 Inductees].
