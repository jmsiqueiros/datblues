He played guitar and [[harmonica]], and wrote several songs for the band.\n\n==Early years==\nWilson was born and grew up in the Boston suburb of [[Arlington, Massachusetts]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Davis|first=Rebecca|title=Blind Owl Blues: The Mysterious Life and Death of Blues Legend Alan Wilson|year=2013|publisher=Blind Owl Blues|isbn=0615792987|pages=7\n}}</ref>  He majored in music at [[Boston University]] and often played the Cambridge coffeehouse folk-blues circuit. He acquired the nickname \"Blind Owl\" owing to his extreme [[myopia|nearsightedness]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Davis|first=Rebecca|title=Blind Owl Blues: The Mysterious Life and Death of Blues Legend Alan Wilson|year=2013|publisher=Blind Owl Blues|isbn=0615792987|pages=63, 85\n}}</ref> In one instance when he was playing at a wedding, he laid his guitar on the wedding cake because he did not see it. As Canned Heat's drummer, Fito de la Parra, wrote in his book: \"Without the glasses, Alan literally could not recognize the people he played with at two feet, that's how blind the 'Blind Owl' was.\" <ref>{{cite book|last=de la Parra|first=Fito|title=Living The Blues: Canned Heat's Story of Music, Drugs, Death, Sex, and Survival|year=2000|publisher=Canned Heat Music|isbn=0967644909|page=125}}</ref>   Wilson wrote for a newspaper in Boston and was considered one of the foremost experts on the blues musicians who came before him.  A dedicated student of early blues, his biggest influences included [[Skip James]], [[Robert Johnson]], [[Son House]], [[Charley Patton]], [[Tommy Johnson (blues musician)|Tommy Johnson]], [[John Lee Hooker]], [[Muddy Waters]] and [[Booker White]].  James was the most exalted figure in Wilson's personal music journey.  In high school, Wilson studied James' 1931 recordings with great fascination.  It was around that time Wilson began singing similar to James' high pitch.  Wilson eventually perfected the high tenor, for which he would become known.\n\n==Canned Heat==\nWith Canned Heat, Wilson performed at two prominent concerts of the 1960s era, the [[Monterey Pop Festival]] in 1967 and [[Woodstock Festival|Woodstock]] in 1969. Although Canned Heat's performance was cut from the original theatrical release of the ''[[Woodstock (film)|Woodstock]]'' film, they were featured in the 25th anniversary \"Director's Cut.\" The exception was \"[[Going Up the Country]],\" which was featured in the opening credits of the original Woodstock film.<ref>{{cite book|last=de la Parra|first=Fito|title=Living The Blues: Canned Heat's Story of Music, Drugs, Death, Sex, and Survival|year=2000|publisher=Canned Heat Music|isbn=0967644909|page=19}}</ref> It has been referred to as the festival's unofficial theme song. Wilson also wrote and sang the notable \"[[On the Road Again (Canned Heat song)|On the Road Again]].\" In an interview with [[Down Beat]] magazine he remarked that, \"...on On The Road Again [second LP] I appear in six different capacities \u2013 three [[tamboura]] parts, harmonica, vocal, and guitar, all recorded at different times.\" <ref>''Down Beat'' magazine, published June 19, 1968</ref>\n\nWilson was a passionate [[conservationism|conservationist]] who loved reading books on [[botany]] and [[ecology]]. He often slept outdoors to be closer to nature. In 1969, he wrote and recorded a song, \"Poor Moon\", which expressed concern over potential pollution of the [[moon]]. He wrote an essay called 'Grim Harvest', about the coastal [[redwood]] forests of California, which was printed as the liner notes to the ''[[Future Blues (Canned Heat album)|Future Blues]]'' [[album]] by Canned Heat.\n\nAfter [[Son House|Eddie 'Son' House]]'s 'rediscovery' in 1964, Wilson taught him how to play again the songs House had recorded in 1930 and 1942 (which he had forgotten over a long absence from music); House recorded for Columbia in 1965 and two of three selections featuring Wilson on harmonica and guitar appeared on the set.  On the double album ''[[Hooker 'N Heat]]'' (1970), [[John Lee Hooker]] is heard wondering how Wilson is capable of following Hooker's guitar playing so well. Hooker was known to be a difficult performer to accompany, partly because of his disregard of [[Song structure (popular music)|song form]]. Yet Wilson seemed to have no trouble at all following him on this album. Hooker concludes that \"you [Wilson] musta been listenin' to my records all your life\". Hooker is also known to have stated \"Wilson is the greatest harmonica player ever\"\n\n[[Stephen Stills]]' song \"Blues Man\" from the album ''[[Manassas (album)|Manassas]]'' is dedicated to Wilson, along with [[Jimi Hendrix]] and [[Duane Allman]].\n\n==Death==\nOn September 3, 1970 Wilson was found dead on a hillside behind band mate [[Bob Hite]]'s [[Topanga, California|Topanga Canyon]] house. He was 27 years old. An autopsy identified his cause of death as [[Barbiturate overdose|acute barbiturate intoxication]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Davis|first=Rebecca|title=Blind Owl Blues: The Mysterious Life and Death of Blues Legend Alan Wilson|year=2013|publisher=Blind Owl Blues|isbn=0615792987|pages=229, 243}}</ref> Wilson reportedly had attempted [[suicide]] a few months earlier, attempting to drive his car off a freeway in Los Angeles. He was briefly hospitalized for significant [[Major Depressive Disorder|Depression]], and was released after a few weeks.<ref>{{cite book|last=Talevski|first=Nick|title=Rock Obituaries - Knocking On Heaven's Door|year=2006|publisher=Omnibus Press|isbn=1846090911|page=719}}</ref>  Although his death is sometimes reported as a suicide, this is not clearly established and he left no note.<ref>''Rolling Stone'' issue #68, published October 29, 1970</ref> Wilson's death came just two weeks before the death of [[Jimi Hendrix]] and four weeks before the death of [[Janis Joplin]].\n\nWilson was interested in preserving the natural world, particularly the redwood trees. When he died, so too did the Music Mountain organization he had initiated dedicated to this purpose.<ref>{{cite book|last=Davis|first=Rebecca|title=Blind Owl Blues: The Mysterious Life and Death of Blues Legend Alan Wilson|year=2013|publisher=Blind Owl Blues|isbn=0615792987|pages=218\u2013219}}</ref>  In order to support his dream, Wilson\u2019s family has purchased a \u201cgrove naming\u201d in his memory through the [[Save the Redwoods League]] of California. The money donated to create this memorial will be used by the League to support redwood reforestation, research, education, and land acquisition of both new and old growth redwoods.<ref>{{cite book|last=Davis|first=Rebecca|title=Blind Owl Blues: The Mysterious Life and Death of Blues Legend Alan Wilson|year=2013|publisher=Blind Owl Blues|isbn=0615792987|pages=3}}</ref>\n\n==Discography==\n* ''Father of the Delta Blues: The Complete 1965 Sessions'', w/ [[Son House]] 1965\n* ''[[The Great San Bernardino Birthday Party & Other Excursions]]'', w/ [[John Fahey (musician)|John Fahey]] 1966\n* ''[[Vintage (Canned Heat album)|Vintage Heat]]'' [[Canned Heat]] 1966, Janus Records\n* ''[[Canned Heat (album)|Canned Heat]]'' [[Canned Heat]] 1967, Liberty Records\n* ''[[Fred Neil]]'' w/ [[Fred Neil]] 1967, Capitol Records\n* ''[[Boogie with Canned Heat]]'' [[Canned Heat]], 1968, Liberty Records\n* ''[[Living the Blues]]'' [[Canned Heat]], 1968, Liberty Records\n* ''[[Woodstock]]'' w/ [[Canned Heat]], 1969, Warner Bros.
