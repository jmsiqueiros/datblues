She later formed the Exotics, singing and dancing particularly at the Royal Peacock Club, one of the premier Atlanta [[nightclub]]s.  The Exotics opened for several touring acts at that venue, including [[Otis Redding]], [[Joe Tex]] and [[the Temptations]].  By the late 1960s, Hall had trained as a nurse, supplementing her income by working variously as a singer, go-go dancer and stripper.  She also raised her daughter during this time.<ref name=\"AMG\"/><ref name=\"Soulblues\"/>\n\nShe continued singing in a semi-professional vein, whilst working full-time as a nurse.  She developed her stage act to include a risque repertoire which was ripe with innuendo. Her better known songs included \"Big Long Sliding Thing,\" \"One Drop Will Do You,\" and \"Pump Up Your Love\".<ref name=\"AMG\"/><ref name=\"Empress\">{{cite web|url=http://www.sandrahallbluesempress.org/ |title=Sandra Hall - The Empress of the Blues Official Site |publisher=Sandrahallbluesempress.org |date= |accessdate=2014-03-11}}</ref><ref name=\"Soulblues\"/>  Hall's live work came to the attention of [[Ichiban Records]] and, in 1995, they released her debut solo album, ''Showin' Off''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/showin-off-mw0000125155/releases |title=Showin' Off - Sandra Hall &#124; Releases |publisher=AllMusic |date= |accessdate=2014-03-11}}</ref> The same year she appeared at the [[Sarasota Blues Fest]]. Hall continued to work largely around Atlanta, but her recording exposure led her on tours in Europe, which included her performing at the [[Montreux Jazz Festival]].<ref name=\"AMG\"/><ref name=\"Empress\"/><ref name=\"Soulblues\"/>  Her second album, ''One Drop Will Do You'', was issued in 1997.  The [[Allmusic]] [[music journalism|journalist]], Alex Henderson, noted that ''One Drop Will Do You'' \"isn't an innovative or groundbreaking album, but it's certainly a very satisfying and inspired one\".<ref>{{cite web|author=Alex Henderson |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/one-drop-will-do-you-mw0001884288 |title=One Drop Will Do You - Sandra Hall &#124; Songs, Reviews, Credits, Awards |publisher=AllMusic |date=1997-04-22 |accessdate=2014-03-11}}</ref>\n\nIn 2001, she self-released ''Miss Red Riding Hood''.<ref name=\"Soulblues\"/> Hall performed at the W.C.

In 2011, Hall appeared at the [[Julius Daniels]] Memorial Blues Festival.\n\n==Discography==\n===Albums=== \n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!
