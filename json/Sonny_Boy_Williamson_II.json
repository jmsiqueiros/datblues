He recorded successfully in the 1950s and 1960s, and had a direct influence on later blues and rock performers.\n\nHis head stone found in or near Tutwiler, Mississippi,  list his name as Aleck Miller, his birth date as March 11, 1908 and date of death as June 23, 1965.\n\n== Biography ==\n\n=== Year of birth ===\nBorn Alex Miller (pronounced \"Aleck\") on the Sara Jones Plantation in [[Tallahatchie County, Mississippi]], his date and year of birth are a matter of uncertainty. He claimed to have been born on December 5, 1899, but Dr. David Evans, professor of music and an ethnomusicologist at the [[University of Memphis]],<ref>http://www.commercialappeal.com/news/2011/feb/17/ethiopia-blues/?print=1 David Evans, professor of music and an ethnomusicologist at the [[University of Memphis]]</ref> claims to have found [[census]] record evidence that he was born around 1912, being seven on February 2, 1920, the day of the census.<ref>[http://www.furious.com/perfect/sonnyboy.html \"Sonny Boy's Best-Kept Secret\" citation: \"That means that if he was seven on February 2, 1920, the date of the census, Alex \"Rice\" Miller was probably born in 1912\"]</ref><ref>[http://www.sonnyboy.com/index.php \"In the 1920 census researched at my request by Memphis-based blues expert David Evans, Alex appeared as seven years old\"]</ref> His gravestone, set up by record company owner [[Lillian McMurry]] twelve years after his death, gives his date of birth as March 11, 1908,<ref>[http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&GRid=5341 findagrave.com page] grave stone information</ref> but the birth date on that stone is most likely incorrect.<ref name=\"arkansas\" />\n\n=== Early years ===\nHe lived and worked with his [[sharecropper]] stepfather, Jim Miller, whose last name he soon adopted, and mother, Millie Ford, until the early 1930s. Beginning in the 1930s, he traveled around Mississippi and Arkansas and encountered [[Big Joe Williams]], [[Elmore James]] and [[Robert Lockwood, Jr.]], also known as Robert Junior Lockwood, who would play guitar on his later [[Checker Records]] sides. He was also associated with [[Robert Johnson (musician)|Robert Johnson]] during this period. Miller developed his style and raffish stage persona during these years. [[Willie Dixon]] recalled seeing Lockwood and Miller playing for tips in [[Greenville, Mississippi]] in the 1930s. He entertained audiences with novelties such as inserting one end of the harmonica into his mouth and playing with no hands.  At this time he was often known as '''\"Rice\" Miller''' \u2014 a childhood nickname stemming from his love of rice and milk<ref>[http://www.celticguitarmusic.com/Harmsb2.htm  William Donoughue, '' 'Fessor Mojo On Rice Miller (Sonny Boy II)'']. Retrieved 6 April 2013</ref> \u2014 or as '''Little Boy Blue'''.<ref>[http://www.sonnyboy.com/  ''Sonny Boy's Lonesome Cabin'']. Retrieved 6 April 2013</ref>\n\nIn 1941 Miller was hired to play the ''[[King Biscuit Time]]'' show, advertising the King Biscuit brand of baking flour on radio station [[KFFA (AM)|KFFA]] in [[Helena, Arkansas]] with Lockwood.\n\nIt was at this point that the radio program's sponsor, Max Moore, began billing Miller as Sonny Boy Williamson, apparently in an attempt to capitalize on the fame of the well known Chicago-based harmonica player and singer [[Sonny Boy Williamson I|Sonny Boy Williamson]] (birth name John Lee Williamson, died 1948). Although John Lee Williamson was a major blues star who had already released dozens of successful and widely influential records under the name \"Sonny Boy Williamson\" from 1937 onward, Aleck Miller would later claim to have been the first to use the name, and some blues scholars believe that Miller's assertion he was born in 1899 was a ruse to convince audiences he was old enough to have used the name before John Lee Williamson, who was born in 1914 (see ''year of birth'' section above).\nWhatever the methodology, Miller became commonly known as \"Sonny Boy Williamson,\" (universally distinguished by blues fans and musicians as \"Sonny Boy Williamson '''number two'''\" or \"Sonny Boy Williamson '''the second'''\") and Lockwood and the rest of his band were billed as the King Biscuit Boys.\n\n=== Radio show in Memphis ===\nIn 1949 he relocated to [[West Memphis, Arkansas]] and lived with his sister and her husband, Howlin' Wolf. (Later, for Checker Records, he did a parody of Howlin' Wolf entitled \"Like Wolf.\") Sonny Boy started his own KWEM radio show from 1948 to 1950 selling the elixir [[Hadacol]].\n\nSonny Boy also brought his King Biscuit musician friends to West Memphis, Elmore James, [[Houston Stackhouse]], Arthur \"Big Boy\" Crudup, Robert Nighthawk and others to perform on KWEM Radio.\n\nIn the 1940s Williamson married Mattie Gordon, who remained his wife until his death.\n\n=== Recording career ===\n;Trumpet Records\nWilliamson's first recording session took place in 1951 for [[Lillian McMurry]] of [[Jackson, Mississippi]]'s [[Trumpet Records]], three years after the death of John Lee Williamson, which for the first time allowed some legitimacy to Miller's carefully worded claim to being \"the one and only Sonny Boy Williamson\". McMurry later erected Williamson's headstone, near [[Tutwiler, Mississippi]], in 1977.\n\n;Checker Records\nWhen Trumpet went bankrupt in 1955, Sonny Boy's recording contract was yielded to its creditors, who sold it to [[Chess Records]] in [[Chicago, Illinois]]. Sonny Boy had begun developing a following in Chicago beginning in 1953, when he appeared there as a member of [[Elmore James]]'s band. It was during his Chess years that he enjoyed his greatest success and acclaim, recording about 70 songs for Chess subsidiary [[Checker Records]] from 1955 to 1964. Sonny Boy's first [[LP record]] was titled ''[[Down and Out Blues]]'' and was released by Checker Records in 1959.\n\n;Ace Records\nOne single, \"Boppin' With Sonny\" b/w \"No Nights By Myself\" was released with [[Ace Records (United States)|Ace Records]] in 1955.<ref>[http://www.globaldogproductions.info/a/ace.html Ace Records singles]</ref>\n\n=== 1960s European tours ===\nIn the early 1960s he toured Europe several times during the height of the British blues craze backed on a number of occasions by The Authentics (see ''[[American Folk Blues Festival]]''), recording with [[The Yardbirds]] (see album: ''[[Sonny Boy Williamson and The Yardbirds]]'') and [[The Animals]], and appearing on several TV broadcasts throughout Europe. During this time Sonny was quoted as saying of the backing bands who accompanied him, \"those British boys want to play the blues real bad, and they do\". According to the Led Zeppelin biography ''Hammer of the Gods'', while in England Sonny Boy set his hotel room on fire while trying to cook a rabbit in a coffee percolator. The book also maintains that future Led Zeppelin vocalist Robert Plant purloined one of the bluesman's harmonicas at one of these shows as well. Robert Palmer's \"Deep Blues\" mentions that during this tour he allegedly stabbed a man during a street fight and left the country abruptly.\n\nSonny Boy took a liking to the European fans, and while there had a custom-made, two-tone suit tailored personally for him, along with a bowler hat, matching umbrella, and an attach\u00e9 case for his harmonicas. He appears credited as \"Big Skol\" on [[Roland Kirk]]'s live album ''[[Kirk in Copenhagen]]'' (1963).<ref>[http://www.jazzdisco.org/roland-kirk/catalog/#mercury-mg-20894 Rahsaan Roland Kirk discography] accessed 11 August 2009.</ref> One of his final recordings from England, in 1964, featured him singing \"I'm Trying To Make London My Home\" with [[Hubert Sumlin]] providing the guitar. Due to his many years of relating convoluted, highly fictionalized accounts of his life to friends and family, upon his return to the Delta, some expressed disbelief upon hearing of Sonny Boy's touring across the Atlantic, visiting Europe, seeing the Eiffel Tower, Big Ben, and other landmarks, and recording there.\n\n=== Return to the U.S. and death ===\nUpon his return to the U.S., he resumed playing the King Biscuit Time show on KFFA, and performed in the [[Helena, Arkansas|Helena]], [[Arkansas]] area. As fellow musicians [[Houston Stackhouse]] and Peck Curtis waited at the KFFA studios for Williamson on May 25, 1965, the 12:15 broadcast time was closing in and Sonny Boy was nowhere in sight. Peck left the radio station to locate Williamson, and discovered his body in bed at the rooming house where he had been staying, dead of an apparent [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] suffered in his sleep the night before.\n\nWilliamson is buried on New Africa Rd. just outside [[Tutwiler, Mississippi|Tutwiler]], [[Mississippi]] at the site of the former Whitman Chapel cemetery. His headstone was provided by Mrs. [[Lillian McMurry]], owner of [[Trumpet Records]]; the death date shown on the stone is incorrect.<ref name=arkansas />\n\n== Legacy ==\n\n=== Recording anthology ===\nSome of his better known songs include \"[[Don't Start Me Talkin'|Don't Start Me To Talkin']]\" (his only major hit, it reached the #3 position on the national Billboard R&B charts in 1955),\"Fattenin' Frogs for Snakes\", \"Keep It To Yourself\", \"Your Funeral and My Trial\", \"Bye Bye Bird\", \"Nine Below Zero\", \"[[Help Me (song)|Help Me]]\", \"[[Checkin' Up on My Baby]]\", and the infamous \"Little Village\", with dialogue 'unsuitable for airplay' with [[Leonard Chess]]. His song \"[[Eyesight to the Blind]]\" was performed by [[The Who]] as a key song in their [[rock opera]] ''[[Tommy (album)|Tommy]]'' (the only song in that opus not written by a band member) and it was later covered on the [[Aerosmith]] album ''[[Honkin' on Bobo]]''.<ref>[http://www.thewho.net/discography/songs/EyesighttotheBlind.html ]{{dead link|date=December 2011}}</ref> His \"[[One Way Out (song)|One Way Out]]\", reworked from [[Elmore James]] and recorded twice in the early 1960s, became popularized by [[The Allman Brothers Band]] in the early 1970s. In interviews in ''[[The Last Waltz]]'', roots-rockers [[The Band]] recount jamming with Miller prior to their initial fame as Bob Dylan's electric backing band, and making never-realized plans to become his backing band. Many of his most famous recordings appeared on ''The Essential Sonny Boy Williamson'' and ''[[His Best (Sonny Boy Williamson II album)|His Best]]''.\n\n=== Musical influence ===\nWilliamson's output of recordings, both issued and unissued, for Lillian McMurray's Trumpet label, can be found on Arhoolie, Alligator, Purple Pyramid, Collectables, plus a handful of other domestic and import imprints, while his years as a resident of the Chess/Checker house appear on various compilations on MCA/Chess. His European recordings reside on Alligator, Analogue Productions, Storyville, and others.\n\nWilliamson had an influence on modern day blues and blues rock artists, as is shown by the number of his songs that were covered, including\n* [[Muddy Waters]] \u2013 \"Nine Below Zero\"\n* [[Canned Heat]] \u2013 \"Nine Below Zero\" and \"[[Help Me (song)|Help Me]]\"\n* [[Junior Wells]] \u2013 \"Help Me\"\n* [[Howlin' Wolf]] \u2013 \"Cool Disposition\"\n* [[B.
