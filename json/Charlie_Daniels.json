In 1964, Daniels co-wrote \"It Hurts Me\" (a song which [[Elvis Presley]] recorded) with Joy Byers. He worked as a Nashville [[session musician]], often for producer [[Bob Johnston]], including playing electric bass on three [[Bob Dylan]] albums during 1969 and 1970, and on recordings by [[Leonard Cohen]]. Daniels recorded his first solo album, ''Charlie Daniels'', in 1971 (see [[1971 in country music]]). He produced the 1969 album by [[The Youngbloods]], ''[[Elephant Mountain]]'' and played the violin on \"Darkness, Darkness\".\n\nHis first hit, the [[novelty song]] \"[[Uneasy Rider]]\", was from his 1973 second album, ''Honey in the Rock'', and reached No.9 on the [[Billboard Hot 100]].\n\n[[File:CharlieDaniels265-1000.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Daniels in concert at the Chumash Casino Resort in [[Santa Ynez, California]]]]\nDuring this period, Daniels played fiddle on many of The [[Marshall Tucker Band]]'s early albums: \"A New Life\", \"Where We All Belong\", \"Searchin' For a Rainbow\", \"Long Hard Ride\" and \"Carolina Dreams\". Daniels can be heard on the live portion of the \"Where We All Belong\" album, recorded in Milwaukee, WI on July 11, 1974.\n\nIn 1974, Daniels organized the first in a series of [[Volunteer Jam]] concerts based in or around [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]], Tennessee, often playing with members of [[Barefoot Jerry]].\nExcept for a three-year gap in the late 1980s, these jams have continued ever since.\n\nIn 1975, he had a top 30 hit as leader of the Charlie Daniels Band with the [[Southern rock]] self-identification anthem \"The South's Gonna Do It Again\". \"[[Long Haired Country Boy]]\" was a minor hit in that year. Daniels played fiddle on [[Hank Williams, Jr.]]'s 1975 album [[Hank Williams, Jr. and Friends]].\n\nDaniels won the [[Grammy Award for Best Country Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal|Grammy Award for Best Country Vocal Performance]] in 1979 for \"[[The Devil Went Down to Georgia]]\", which reached No.&nbsp;3 on the [[Hot 100]] in September 1979.  The following year, \"Devil\" became a major crossover success on rock radio stations after its inclusion on the soundtrack for the hit movie ''[[Urban Cowboy]]''.  Daniels appeared in the movie.  The song is by far Daniels' greatest success, still receiving regular airplay on U.S. classic rock and country stations, and is well-known even among audiences who eschew country music in general.  A [[hard rock]]/[[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] [[cover version]] of the song was included in the video game ''[[Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock]]'' as the final [[guitar battle]] against the last boss (Lou, the [[devil]]).  Daniels has openly stated his opposition to the metal cover and the devil winning occasionally in the game.<ref>[http://www.charliedaniels.com/soapbox-2008/soapbox-2008-040408.htm Charlie Daniels \u2013 Soap Box \u2013 \"Guitar Hero\"].

In 1980, Daniels participated in the country music concept album, ''[[The Legend of Jesse James]]''.\n\nIn the late 1980s and 1990s, several of Daniels' albums and singles were hits on the [[country music|Country]] charts and the music continues to receive airplay on country stations today.  Daniels released several [[gospel music|Gospel]] and [[Christian music|Christian]] records.  In 1999 he made a guest vocal appearance on his song \"All Night Long\" with Montgomery Gentry (Eddie Montgomery and Troy Gentry) for their debut album, \"Tattoos and Scars,\" which was a commercial success.\n\nDaniels' distinctive speaking voice was used in [[Frank Wildhorn|Frank Wildhorn's]] 1999 musical, [[The Civil War (musical)|The Civil War]]. He is featured in the Prologue and \"In Great Deeds.\"\n\nDaniels was inducted into the [[North Carolina Music Hall of Fame]] in 1999.<ref>{{cite web|title=1999 Inductees|url=http://northcarolinamusichalloffame.org/category/inductees/1999-inductees/|publisher=North Carolina Music Hall of Fame|accessdate=September 10, 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn 2000, he composed and performed the score for the feature film ''[[Across the Line (2000 film)|Across the Line]]'' starring [[Brad Johnson (actor)|Brad Johnson]].

Daniels continues to tour regularly. Daniels appeared in commercials for [[United Parcel Service|UPS]] in 2002 with other celebrities convincing [[NASCAR]] driver [[Dale Jarrett]] to race the UPS Truck.\n\n[[Joel DiGregorio|William Joel \"Taz\" DiGregorio]], Daniels' keyboardist, died in a car accident in Cheatham County, Tennessee, on 12 October 2011.\n\nDaniels is featured playing fiddle in a television commercial for [[GEICO]] [[Vehicle insurance|auto insurance]].<ref name=geico>{{cite web\n  |author=Staff reporter\n  | title = Charlie Daniels Fiddles for GEICO\n  |work=Country Weekly\n  | date = December 29, 2009\n  | url = http://www.countryweekly.com/charlie_daniels/news/4393\n  | accessdate =February 6, 2010\n  | quote = }} ([http://www.webcitation.org/5nL6rtXmP Archived by WebCite])</ref>\n\n==Political statements==\n[[Image:Charlie Daniels at NavSta Great Lakes.jpg|thumb|upright|Charlie Daniels performing at U.S. Naval Station Great Lakes, September 11, 2003]]\n\"The South's Gonna Do It\" had a mild message of Southern cultural identity within the Southern rock movement. Daniels was an early supporter of [[Jimmy Carter]]'s [[President of the United States|presidential]] bid and performed at his January 1977 inauguration.\n\n\"[[In America (Charlie Daniels song)|In America]]\" was a reaction to the 1979\u20131981 [[Iran Hostage Crisis]]; it described a patriotic, united America where \"we'll all stick together and you can take that to the bank / That's the cowboys and the hippies and the rebels and the yanks.\"  The song experienced a revival following the [[September 11 attacks]], when it was floated around the internet as \"Fuck [[Osama Bin Laden|Bin Laden]].\" In contrast, \"[[Still in Saigon]]\" (written by Dan Daley) was an effective portrayal of the plight of the American [[Vietnam veteran]] ten years after the war; it was part of an early 1980s wave of attention to the subject, presaging treatments such as [[Bruce Springsteen]]'s \"[[Born in the U.S.A. (song)|Born in the U.S.A.]]\" and \"Shut Out the Light\", [[Billy Joel]]'s \"[[Goodnight Saigon]]\", [[Huey Lewis and the News]]' \"[[Walking on a Thin Line (song)|Walking on a Thin Line]]\", [[Paul Hardcastle]]'s \"[[19 (song)|19]]\" and somewhat later [[Steve Earle]]'s \"Copperhead Road\".\n\nIn 1989, Daniels' country hit \"Simple Man\" was interpreted by some as advocating [[vigilantism]]. Lyrics such as \"Just take them rascals [rapists, killers, child abusers] out in the swamp / Put 'em on their knees and tie 'em to a stump / Let the rattlers and the bugs and the alligators do the rest,\" got Daniels considerable media attention and talk show visits.\n\nIn 2003, Daniels published an ''Open Letter to the Hollywood Bunch'' in defense of President [[George W. Bush]]'s [[2003 invasion of Iraq|Iraq]] policy. His 2003 book ''Ain't No Rag: Freedom, Family, and the Flag'' contains this letter as well as many other personal statements. During the 2004 presidential campaign, Daniels said that having never served in the military himself, he did not have the right to criticize [[John Kerry]]'s service record, but that Kerry should allow the release of his official military record to establish the truth or falsehood of allegations from the [[Swift Boat Veterans for Truth]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.charliedaniels.com/soapbox/print/399.html |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20050409190807/http://www.charliedaniels.com/soapbox/print/399.html |archivedate=2005-04-09 |title=Internet Archive Wayback Machine |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=April 9, 2005 |accessdate=July 6, 2011}}</ref> His band's official website contains a \"soapbox\" page,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.charliedaniels.com/soapbox.htm |title=The Charlie Daniels Band \u2013 Soapbox |publisher=Charliedaniels.com |accessdate=July 6, 2011}}</ref> where Daniels has made statements such as the following: \"In the future Darwinism will be looked upon as we now look upon the flat earth theory,\" and \"I am more afraid of you and your ilk than I am of the terrorists,\" regarding [[United States Senate|U.S. Senator]] [[Harry Reid]].
