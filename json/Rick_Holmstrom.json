That same year, Holmstrom suffered a significant tragedy in his family, as his father and younger sister were killed in a [[whitewater]] rafting accident in Alaska's [[Wrangell-St. Elias National Park]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Film crew's raft trip ends in death;  former governor escapes injury in Wrangell St. Elias accident which claims 3|first=David|last=Hulen|newspaper=[[Anchorage Daily News]]|publisher=[[The McClatchy Company]]|location=[[Anchorage]]|date=August 8, 1988|page=A1}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://alaskawhitewater.8m.com/whitewaterdeaths.htm|title=Recent Alaska Whitewater Accidents|first=Ted|last=Coats|date=June 9, 1999|work=TC's Alaska Whitewater Rafting Page|accessdate=April 6, 2013}}</ref>  Later joining forces with [[Johnny Dyer]], Holmstrom played on his albums, ''Listen Up'' (1994) and ''Shake It!''

Holmstrom's next release, ''Hydraulic Groove'' (2002) is one of his most daring efforts, where he used [[loop (music)|loops]] and [[Sampling (music)|samples]], and incorporated elements of [[acid jazz]]/[[nu-jazz]], [[funk]] and [[trip-hop]] to his blues, featuring guest performances of [[John Medeski]] and [[DJ Logic]].<ref name=\"AMG\"/> ''Hydraulic Groove'' peaked at #9 in the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' Top Blues Albums chart.<ref name=\"Chart\">{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|artist/rick-holmstrom-p87585/charts-awards|pure_url=yes}} |title=Allmusic ((( Rick Holmstrom > Charts & Awards > Billboard Albums )))}}</ref> In 2005, Holmstrom played at the [[Dark Season Blues]] [[music festival|festival]].
