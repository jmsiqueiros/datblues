Retrieved 7 March 2013</ref>\nHe began playing guitar at the age of 13, and with [[Leo Lyons]] formed the core of the band [[Ten Years After]] in 1960. Influenced by his parents' collection of [[jazz]] and [[blues]] [[gramophone record|records]], it was the advent of [[rock and roll]] that sparked his interest, and guitarists such as [[Chuck Berry]] and [[Scotty Moore]] provided his inspiration.\n\nLee began to play professionally in 1962, in a band named the Jaybirds, who enjoyed popularity in their native England, but moved on to seek a wider fan-base. They began that year to perform in the [[Star-Club]] in Hamburg, Germany, following closely behind [[The Beatles]]. There, with Alvin Lee assuming the permanent role of lead vocalist in addition to that of lead guitarist, they began to build a following. It was not until the band moved to London in 1966 and changed its name, first to Jaybird, dropping 'The' and 's' to make it sound more contemporary; then to Blues Yard (for one [[concert|gig]] at the [[Marquee Club]]); and finally to [[Ten Years After]], that international success beckoned. The band secured a residency at the Marquee Club, and an invitation to the Windsor Jazz & Blues Festival in 1967 led to their first [[recording contract]]. The self-titled d\u00e9but album received [[airplay]] on San Francisco's [[underground music]] radio stations and was embraced by listeners, including concert promoter [[Bill Graham (promoter)|Bill Graham]], who invited the band to tour the United States for the first time in 1968. Ten Years After would ultimately tour the US twenty-eight times in seven years \u2013 more than any other UK band.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}\n\nLee's performance at the [[Woodstock Festival]] was captured on film in the documentary of the event, and his 'lightning-fast' playing<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/cricklewood-green-mw0000650879 |title=Cricklewood Green \u2013 Ten Years After : Songs, Reviews, Credits, Awards |publisher=AllMusic |date= |accessdate=3 July 2013}}</ref> helped catapult him to stardom.<ref name=\"NME Rock 'N' Roll Years\">{{cite book\n| first= John\n| last= Tobler\n| year= 1992\n| title= NME Rock 'N' Roll Years\n| edition= 1st\n| publisher= Reed International Books Ltd\n| location= London\n| page= 201\n| id= CN 5585\n| isbn= 0-600-57602-7}}</ref> Soon the band was playing arenas and stadiums around the globe.

Moving to Columbia Records had resulted in a radio hit song, \"I'd Love To Change the World\", but Lee preferred blues-rock to the pop to which the label steered them. He left Ten Years After after their second Columbia LP. With American [[Christian rock]] singer [[Mylon LeFevre]] and [[George Harrison]], [[Steve Winwood]], [[Ronnie Wood]] and [[Mick Fleetwood]], he [[sound recording and reproduction|recorded]] and released ''[[On the Road to Freedom]]'', an acclaimed album that was at the forefront of [[country rock]]. Also in 1973 he sat in on the Jerry Lee Lewis double album ''The Session'' recorded in London featuring many other guest stars including [[Albert Lee]], [[Peter Frampton]] and [[Rory Gallagher]]. A year later, in response to a dare, Lee formed Alvin Lee & Company to play a show at the [[Rainbow (London)|Rainbow]] in London and released it as a double live album, ''[[In Flight (Alvin Lee album)|In Flight]]''. Various members of the band continued on with Lee for his next two albums, ''[[Pump Iron!]]'' and ''[[Let It Rock (Alvin Lee album)|Let It Rock]]''. In late 1975, he played guitar for a couple of tracks on [[Bo Diddley]]'s ''The 20th Anniversary of Rock 'n' Roll'' all-star album. He finished out the 1970s with an outfit called \"Ten Years Later\" which released two albums, ''[[Rocket Fuel (Alvin Lee album)|Rocket Fuel]]'' (1978) and ''[[Ride On (Alvin Lee album)|Ride On]]'' (1979), and toured extensively throughout Europe and the United States.\n\nThe 1980s brought another change in Lee's direction, with two albums that were collaborations with [[Rare Bird]]'s [[Steve Gould (musician)|Steve Gould]], and a tour with the former [[John Mayall]] and [[Rolling Stones]]' guitarist [[Mick Taylor]] joining his band.\n\nLee's overall musical output includes more than twenty albums, including 1985's ''[[Detroit Diesel (Alvin Lee album)|Detroit Diesel]]'', 1989's [[About Time (Ten Years After album)|''About Time'' (Ten Years After album)]], recorded in [[Memphis]] with producer [[Terry Manning]], and the back to back 1990s collections of ''[[Zoom (Alvin Lee album)|Zoom]]'' and ''[[Nineteen Ninety-Four (Alvin Lee album)|Nineteen Ninety-Four]]'' (US title ''I Hear You Rockin' ''). Guest [[musician|artists]] on both albums included George Harrison.\n\n''In Tennessee'', recorded with [[Scotty Moore]] and [[D. J. Fontana]], was released in 2004. Lee's last album, ''Still on the Road to Freedom'', was released in September 2012.\n\nLee died on 6 March 2013 in Spain.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-207_162-57572963/guitarist-alvin-lee-of-ten-years-after-dies-at-68/ |title=Guitarist Alvin Lee of Ten Years After dies at 68 |publisher=CBS News |date=6 March 2013<!--, 8:34 PM-->}}</ref> According to his website, he died from \"unforeseen complications following a routine surgical procedure\".<ref>{{cite web|author=Rob Power |url=http://www.musicradar.com/news/guitars/ten-years-afters-alvin-lee-dies-571954 |title=Ten Years After's Alvin Lee dies |publisher=MusicRadar |date=6 March 2013<!--, 16:08 GMT-->}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stereoboard.com/content/view/177754/9 |title=Ten Years After Singer And Guitarist Alvin Lee Dies Aged 68 |publisher=Stereoboard UK |date=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.mediabiz.de/musik/news/alvin-lee-von-ten-years-after-verstorben/330348 | title=Alvin Lee von Ten Years After verstorben | accessdate=6 March 2013}}</ref> He was 68.
