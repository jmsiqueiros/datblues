He was born in [[Widener, Arkansas]], and moved with his family, at the age of twelve, to [[Chicago]] in 1951.<ref name=\"amg\"/> He taught himself guitar and began listening to blues extensively. Three years later he began hanging outside blues nightclubs with the hopes of being invited to perform. He played with [[Howlin' Wolf]]'s band and backed [[James Cotton]].\n\n==Career==\nHis big break came in 1957 when [[Howlin' Wolf]] invited Allison to the stage. [[Freddie King]] took him under his wing and after King got his big record deal, Allison took over King's house-band gig on Chicago's west side. He worked the club circuit throughout the late 1950s and early 1960s and recorded his first single in 1965. He was signed to the [[Delmark Records]] label in 1967 and released his debut album, ''Love Me Mama'', the following year. A well-received set at the 1969 [[Ann Arbor Blues Festival]] resulted in his being asked to perform there each of the next three years.<ref name=\"amg\"/> He also toured nationwide and, in 1972, was signed to [[Motown Records]], one of the few blues artists to do so.<ref name=\"russell\"/> By the mid 1970s he began touring Europe and moved to France in 1977.<ref name=\"russell\">{{cite book\n| first= Tony\n| last= Russell\n| year= 1997\n| title= The Blues - From Robert Johnson to Robert Cray\n| edition= \n| publisher=Carlton Books Limited \n| location= Dubai\n| page= 88\n| isbn= 1-85868-255-X}}</ref> Allison was known for his powerful concert performances, lengthy soulful guitar solos and crowd walking with his [[Gibson Les Paul]]. Allison lived briefly during this period in [[Peoria, Illinois]], where he signed briefly with Rumble Records, resulting in two live recordings, \"Gonna Be a Live One in Here Tonight\", produced by Bill Knight, and \"Power Wire Blues\", produced by George Faber and Jeffrey P. Hess. Allison played the \"bar circuit\" in the USA during this period, spending eight months per year in Europe at high-profile venues, including the [[Montreux Jazz Festival]]. In 1992, he played as a duo with legendary French rock'n'roll star [[Johnny Hallyday]] for 18 shows in [[Paris]], also playing during the intermission.\n\nAllison's manager, and European agent, Thomas Ruf, founded the label [[Ruf Records]] in 1994. Signing with Ruf Records, Allison launched a comeback in association with [[Alligator Records]]. Alligator founder [[Bruce Iglauer]] convinced Allison to return to the United States. The album ''Soul Fixin' Man'' was recorded and released in 1994, and Allison toured the U.S. and Canada. He won four [[Blues Music Award|W.C. Handy Awards]] in 1994. With the James Solberg Band backing him, non-stop touring and the release of ''Blue Streak'' (featuring song \"Cherry Red Wine\"), Allison continued to earn more Handys and gain wider recognition. He scored a host of Living Blues Awards and was featured on the cover pages of major blues publications.\n\nIn the middle of his summer of 1997 tour, Allison checked into a hospital for dizziness and loss of coordination. It was discovered that he had a tumor on his lung that had [[Metastasis|metastasized]] to his brain.<ref>{{cite news | title = Cancer strikes blues guitarist | url = http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=fLsMAAAAIBAJ&sjid=rV4DAAAAIBAJ&pg=4167,1864144&dq=luther+allison | agency = Reuters | work = St. Petersburg Times | date = July 17, 1997 | page = 2B | accessdate = June 24, 2009 }} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> In and out of a coma, Allison died on August 12, 1997, five days before his 58th birthday, in [[Madison, Wisconsin]].<ref name=\"amg\">[{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p260/biography|pure_url=yes}} Allmusic biography]</ref> His album ''Reckless'' had just been released.
