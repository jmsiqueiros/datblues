Fran is best known for her string of single releases in the 1950s and 1960s, and her later musical association with her husband, Clarence Hollimon. She has released five solo albums since 1992, her final collaboration with Hollimon being on [[JSP Records]].<ref name=\"AMG\"/>\n\n==Biography==\n'''Carol Anthony''' was born in [[Lafayette, Louisiana]], [[United States]].<ref name=\"Soulful\"/><ref name=\"AMG\"/> Commencing her [[jump blues]] singing career with Don Conway, she subsequently relocated to [[New Orleans]].  There she married a saxophone player, Bob Francois, which allowed a simple abbreviation to arrive at her [[stage name]] of Carol Fran. Establishing a musical presence around [[Bourbon Street]], New Orleans, Fran also undertook a tour of Mexico.  Her debut [[Single (music)|single]] was \"Emmitt Lee\", recorded in 1957 and released by [[Excello Records]].  Three more singles ensued, but lack of success saw Fran singing with [[Guitar Slim]], and after his death in 1959, she then sang alongside [[Nappy Brown]], [[Lee Dorsey]], and [[Joe Tex]].<ref name=\"AMG\"/>\n\nLyric Records then offered a [[recording contract]] to Fran.  Her next offerings were a [[swamp pop]] version of \"[[The Great Pretender]]\" (1962) and a [[cover version]] of \"[[Crying in the Chapel]]\" (1964). Despite a subsequent reissue of the latter on [[Josie Records]], her momentum was stalled by [[Elvis Presley]]'s release of his own version. Her follow-up, \"You Can't Stop Me,\" was enhanced by an [[musical arrangement|arrangement]] by [[Sammy Lowe]], whilst the [[Bobby Darin]] penned \"A World Without You\", also failed to find sufficient buyers.  After another effort, \"Any Day Love Walks In,\" she returned to the concert circuit.<ref name=\"AMG\"/>\n\nIn 1967 she signed to [[Roulette Records]] and issued a version of [[Brook Benton]]'s \"So Close.\" Success still eluded here and many recordings remained unreleased.  Downhearted she concentrated on performing in [[nightclub|clubs]] back in Louisiana. In 1982, Fran met the [[session musician|session guitarist]] Clarence Hollimon, and they went on to marry a year later and relocated to [[Texas]]. After appearing together in concert, [[Black Top Records]] released their 1992 album ''Soul Sensation''.<ref name=\"AMG\"/> Elsewhere, in 1993, Fran contributed to [[Guitar Shorty]]'s album, ''[[Topsy Turvy (Guitar Shorty album)|Topsy Turvy]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r235476/credits|pure_url=yes}} |title=Allmusic ((( Topsy Turvy > Credits )))}}</ref> In 1996, Fran and Hollimon appeared at the [[Long Beach Blues Festival]].\n\n''See There!'' (1994) was her next album release, before another collaboration with Hollimon saw the issue of ''It's About Time'' (2000).<ref name=\"AMG\"/>  However, Hollimon died the same year, and Fran moved back to Lafayette, releasing ''Fran-tastic'' in October 2001.<ref name=\"Sound\">{{cite web |url=http://www.soundofneworleans.com/1056~CD.htm |title=Carol Fran - ''Fran-tastic'' |author=Hannusch, Jeff |date= |work= |publisher=Soundofneworleans.com |accessdate=September 14, 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Discography==\n===Albums===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!
