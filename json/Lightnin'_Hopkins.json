Jefferson supposedly never let anyone play with him except for young Hopkins, who learned much from and was influenced greatly by Blind Lemon Jefferson thanks to these gatherings. In the mid-1930s, Hopkins was sent to Houston County Prison Farm for an unknown offense.<ref name=\"amg\"/> In the late 1930s, Hopkins moved to Houston with Alexander in an unsuccessful attempt to break into the music scene there. By the early 1940s, he was back in Centerville working as a farm hand.\n\nHopkins took a second shot at Houston in 1946. While singing on Dowling St. in Houston's [[Third Ward, Houston|Third Ward]] (which would become his home base), he was discovered by Lola Anne Cullum from the [[Los Angeles]]-based [[record label]] [[Aladdin Records (US)|Aladdin Records]].<ref name=\"amg\"/> She convinced Hopkins to travel to Los Angeles, where he accompanied pianist Wilson Smith. The [[duet (music)|duo]] [[sound recording and reproduction|recorded]] twelve tracks in their first sessions in 1946. An Aladdin Records executive decided the pair needed more dynamism in their names and dubbed Hopkins \"Lightnin'\" and Wilson \"Thunder\".\n\nHopkins recorded more sides for Aladdin in 1947. He returned to Houston and began recording for the [[Gold Star Records]] label. During the late 1940s and 1950s Hopkins rarely performed outside Texas. He occasionally travelled to the [[Midwestern United States|Mid-West]] and [[Eastern United States]] for recording sessions and [[concert]] appearances. It has been estimated that he recorded between 800 and 1000 songs during his career. He performed regularly at [[nightclub|clubs]] in and around Houston, particularly in Dowling St. where he had first been discovered. He recorded his [[hit record|hits]] \"T-Model Blues\" and \"Tim Moore's Farm\" at [[SugarHill Recording Studios]] in Houston.  By the mid to late 1950s, his prodigious output of quality recordings had gained him a following among [[African American]]s and blues music [[Fan (person)|aficionados]].{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}\n\nIn 1959, Hopkins was contacted by [[Robert \"Mack\" McCormick|Mack McCormick]], who hoped to bring him to the attention of the broader musical audience, which was caught up in the [[Roots revival|folk revival]].<ref name=\"amg\"/> McCormack presented Hopkins to integrated audiences first in Houston and then in [[California]]. Hopkins debuted at [[Carnegie Hall]] on October 14, 1960, appearing alongside [[Joan Baez]] and [[Pete Seeger]] performing the spiritual \"[[Mary Don't You Weep]]\". In 1960, he signed to [[Tradition Records]]. The recordings which followed included his song \"Mojo Hand\" in 1960.\n\nIn 1968, Hopkins recorded the [[album]] ''Free Form Patterns'' backed by the rhythm section of [[psychedelic rock]] [[band (music)|band]] the [[13th Floor Elevators]]. Through the 1960s and into the 1970s, Hopkins released one or sometimes two albums a year and toured, playing at major [[folk music|folk]] [[music festival|festivals]] and at folk clubs and on college campuses in the [[United States|U.S.]] and internationally.  He toured extensively in the United States<ref name=\"russell\"/> and played a six-city tour of Japan in 1978.\n\nHouston's [[poetry|poet]]-in-residence for 35 years, Hopkins recorded more albums than any other bluesman.<ref name=\"russell\"/>\n\nHopkins died of [[esophageal cancer]] in Houston on January 30, 1982, at the age of 69. His ''[[New York Times]]'' obituary named him as \"one of the great country blues and perhaps the greatest single influence on rock guitar players.\"<ref>{{cite news| url = http://www.nytimes.com/1982/02/01/obituaries/sam-lightnin-hopkins-69-blues-singer-and-guitarist.html| title = Obituary: Sam (Lightnin') Hopkins, 69; Blues Singer and Guitarist| author = Saxon, Wolfgang| date = February 1, 1982| accessdate = November 11, 2012| publisher = ''New York Times''}}</ref>\n\n==References in popular culture==\nA statue of Hopkins sits in [[Crockett, Texas]].<ref name=\"russell\">{{cite book\n| first= Tony\n| last= Russell\n| year= 1997\n| title= The Blues: From Robert Johnson to Robert Cray\n| edition=\n| publisher= Carlton Books Limited\n| location= Dubai\n| pages= 145\u2013146\n| isbn= 1-85868-255-X}}</ref>\n\nHopkins is referenced in [[Erykah Badu]]'s 2010 \"Window Seat\": \"I don't want to time-travel no more, I want to be here.  On this porch I'm rockin', back and forth like Lightnin' Hopkins.\"\n\n[[R.E.M]] features a song named \"Lightnin' Hopkins\" on their 1987 album ''[[Document (album)|Document]]''.\n\n==Style==\nHopkins' style was born from spending many hours playing informally without a backing band. His distinctive [[fingerstyle]] playing often included playing, in effect, [[Bass guitar|bass]], [[Rhythm guitar|rhythm]], [[Lead guitar|lead]], [[percussion]], and [[vocal]]s, all at the same time.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} He played both \"alternating\" and \"monotonic\" bass styles incorporating imaginative, often chromatic [[Turnaround (music)|turnarounds]] and single-note lead lines. Tapping or slapping the body of his guitar added rhythmic accompaniment.\n\nMuch of Hopkins' music follows the standard [[Twelve bar blues|12-bar blues]] template but his phrasing was very free and loose. Many of his songs were in the [[talking blues]] style, but he was a powerful and confident singer.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} Lyrically his songs chronicled the problems of life in the segregated south, bad luck in love and other usual subjects of the blues idiom. He did however deal with these subjects with humor and good nature. Many of his songs are filled with [[double entendre]]s and he was known for his humorous introductions.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}\n\nSome of his songs were of warning and sour prediction such as \"Fast Life Woman\":\n\n:''\"You may see a fast life woman sittin' round a whiskey joint,\n:''Yes, you know, she'll be sittin' there smilin',\n:'' 'Cause she knows some man gonna buy her half a pint,\n:''Take it easy, fast life woman, 'cause you ain't gon' live always...''\"<ref name=\"russell\"/>\n\n==Selected discography==\n*1959 - ''Lightnin' Hopkins Strums the Blues'' (Score)\n*1959 - ''Lightnin' Hopkins'' ([[Folkways Records|Folkways]])\n*1959 - ''Lightnin' and the Blues'' (Herald)\n*1960 - ''Country Blues'' ([[Tradition Records]])\n*1960 - ''Last Night Blues'' ([[Bluesville Records]])\n*1960 - ''Mojo Hand'' ([[Fire Records]])\n*1960 - ''Lightnin' '' (Bluesville)\n*1960 - ''Lightnin' In New York '' ([[Candid Records]])\n*1961 - ''Autobiography in Blues'' (Tradition)\n*1961 - ''[[Blues in My Bottle]]'' (Bluesville)\n*1962 - ''Walkin' This Road By Myself'' (Bluesville)\n*1962 - ''Lightnin' and Co.''
