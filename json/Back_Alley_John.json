The street people there kind of took him under their wing and they said 'Listen John, you can't busk on the street 'cause you'll get arrested. You've gotta busk in the back alleys.' So he busked in the back alleys of Venice for a couple of years and that's how he was named Back Alley John.\"<ref>Heath McCoy, [http://www.canada.com/calgaryherald/news/entertainment/story.html?id=adea03a0-50f3-42de-92fe-5cd724355754&k=40361 Blues scene remembers 'real deal' Back Alley John].
