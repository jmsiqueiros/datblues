In 1929 he moved to Chicago and set up a [[Rum-running|bootlegging]] business, an activity he continued throughout [[Prohibition]]. In 1930 Arnold moved south briefly, and made his first [[sound recording and reproduction|recordings]], \"Rainy Night Blues\" and \"Paddlin' Madeline Blues\", under the name '''Gitfiddle Jim''' for the [[Radio Corporation of America#History of RCA|Victor]] label in [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]].<ref name=\"russell\"/> He soon moved back to Chicago, although he was forced to make a living as a musician after Prohibition ended in 1933. [[Kansas Joe McCoy]] heard him and introduced him to [[Mayo Williams]] who was producing records for Decca.<ref name=\"Briggs\"/>\n\nFrom his first recording for Decca on September 10, 1934, until his last on May 12, 1938, Arnold made 88 sides, seven of which remain lost. Arnold, [[Peetie Wheatstraw]] and [[Bumble Bee Slim]] were dominant figures in [[Chicago blues]] circles of that time. Peetie Wheatstraw & Arnold in particular were also major influences upon musical contemporary seminal [[delta blues]] artist [[Robert Johnson (musician)|Robert Johnson]] and thus modern music as a whole. Johnson turned \"Old Original Kokomo Blues\" into \"[[Sweet Home Chicago]]\", \"Milk Cow Blues\" into \"Milkcow's Calf Blues\", while another Arnold song, \"Sagefield Woman Blues\", introduced the terminology \"[[Dust My Broom|dust my broom]]\", which Johnson used as a song title himself. \n\nArnold's \"[[Milk Cow Blues (song)|Milk Cow Blues]]\" was covered by [[Elvis Presley]] (as \"Milk Cow Blues Boogie\") at the [[Sun Studios]] produced by [[Sam Phillips]] and was issued as one of his early singles, it was later performed by [[Tyler Hilton]] who played Elvis in the 2005 film ''[[Walk the Line]]''. [[Eddie Cochran]] covered \"Milk Cow Blues\" in the late 1950s. [[The Kinks]] recorded it as the opening cut on their 1965 album \"Kontroversy\". [[Aerosmith]] covered \"Milk Cow Blues\" on their 1977 album ''[[Draw the Line (Aerosmith album)|Draw the Line]]'', [[Jerry Lee Lewis]] recorded \"Milk Cow Blues\" in 1979, [[Dead Moon]] covered it on their 1990 album ''Defiance'', [[George Strait]] on his 1991 album ''[[Chill of an Early Fall]]'' and [[Willie Nelson]] on the 2000 album ''[[Milk Cow Blues]]''. [[Robert Johnson]] recorded a sequel entitled \"Milk Cow's Calf Blues\" in the late 1930s.\n\nIn 1938 Arnold left the [[music industry]] and began to work in a Chicago factory.<ref name=\"russell\">{{cite book\n| first= Tony\n| last= Russell\n| year= 1997\n| title= The Blues \u2013 From Robert Johnson to Robert Cray\n| edition= \n| publisher=Carlton Books Limited \n| location= Dubai\n| pages= 89\n| isbn= 1-85868-255-X}}</ref>  Rediscovered by blues researchers in 1962, he showed no enthusiasm for returning to music to take advantage of the new explosion of interest in the blues among young white audiences.<ref name=\"russell\"/> \n\nHe died of a heart attack in Chicago, aged 67, in 1968, and was buried in the [[Burr Oak Cemetery and Restvale Cemetery|Burr Oak Cemetery]] in [[Alsip, Illinois]].<ref>[http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&GRid=7634396 Find a Grave website], retrieved November 15, 2007</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of Chicago blues musicians]]\n*[[List of slide guitarists]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.wirz.de/music/arnold.htm Illustrated Kokomo Arnold discography]\n* [{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p262|pure_url=yes}} allmusic.com entry]\n* [http://www.aaregistry.com/african_american_history/1514/Kokomo_Arnold_Georgia_bluesman African American Registry entry]\n*[http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&GRid=7634396 Profile page for James Kokomo Arnold] on the [[Find-A-Grave]] web site\n\n{{Authority control|VIAF=54334819}}\n{{Persondata\n| NAME              = Arnold, Kokomo\n| ALTERNATIVE NAMES = Arnold, James \n| SHORT DESCRIPTION = American blues musician\n| DATE OF BIRTH     = February 15, 1901\n| PLACE OF BIRTH    = [[Lovejoy, Georgia]], United States\n| DATE OF DEATH     = November 8, 1968\n| PLACE OF DEATH    = [[Chicago, Illinois]], United States\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Arnold, Kokomo}}\n[[Category:1901 births]]\n[[Category:1968 deaths]]\n[[Category:People from Clayton County, Georgia]]\n[[Category:Country blues musicians]]\n[[Category:African-American guitarists]]\n[[Category:American blues guitarists]]\n[[Category:American blues musicians]]\n[[Category:American blues singers]]\n[[Category:Chicago blues musicians]]\n[[Category:Slide guitarists]]\n[[Category:Musicians from Georgia (U.S. state)]]\n[[Category:Decca Records artists]]\n[[Category:RCA Victor artists]]\n[[Category:Deaths from myocardial infarction]]\n[[Category:Cardiovascular disease deaths in Illinois]]"}]}}}}
