He befriended [[Fats Domino]] and, whilst working together, was given his [[nickname]] by Domino. In 1953 he released his debut [[Single (music)|single]], \"Do You Really Love Me\" / \"Is Everything Allright?\", on [[Specialty Records|Specialty]].  Jones recorded a further four songs for [[Imperial Records|Imperial]] in 1954, which were produced by [[Dave Bartholomew]], but all releases failed to find a commercial market.  His connection with Domino endured and, up to 1961, Jones remained as Domino's opening act.<ref name=\"AMG\"/><ref>{{cite book\n| first= Rick\n| last= Coleman\n| year= 2006\n| title= Blue Monday: Fats Domino and the Lost Dawn of Rock 'n' Roll\n| edition= 1st\n| publisher= Da Capo Press\n| location= [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]]\n| isbn= 0-306-81531-1\n| page= 69}}</ref> Jones tracks included the [[blues standard]], \"[[Farther Up the Road]]\".\n\nJones was employed as the vocalist by a New Orleans based band led by the brothers, David and Melvin Lastie, until the late 1960s.<ref name=\"AMG\"/> Jones also had regular employment at a sugar factory.<ref>{{cite book\n| first= Edward\n| last= Amos\n| year= 2002\n| title= Gravesites of Southern musicians\n| edition= 1st\n| publisher= McFarland Press\n| location= United States\n| isbn= 0-7864-1270-4\n| page= 17}}</ref> He returned to the [[recording studio]] in 1975, and issued his [[album]], ''New Orleans R&B Gems'', initially on the [[Netherlands]] based Black Magic [[record label|label]].<ref name=\"AMG\"/> With contributions from veteran musicians including Dave \"Fat Man\" Williams, the [[Gramophone record|record]] faithfully copied the [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]] style and sound of the 1950s.
