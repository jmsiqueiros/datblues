She also recorded under the [[pseudonym]] '''Bessie Jackson'''. The [[music journalism|music critic]] and [[sexology|sexologist]] [[Ernest Borneman]] stated that Bogan, along with [[Ma Rainey]] and [[Bessie Smith]], was in \"the big three of the blues\".<ref name=\"Russell\">{{cite book|first=Tony|last=Russell|year=1997|title=The Blues: From Robert Johnson to Robert Cray|publisher=Carlton Books Limited|location=Dubai|page=94|isbn=1-85868-255-X}}</ref>\n\n==Life and career==\nShe was born '''Lucille Anderson''' in [[Amory, Mississippi]],<ref name=\"AMG\">{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p280/biography|pure_url=yes}}|title=Lucille Bogan|author=Eugene Chadbourne|publisher=[[Allmusic]]|accessdate=November 22, 2011}}</ref> and raised in [[Birmingham, Alabama]].<ref name=\"Russell\"/> In 1914, she married Nazareth Lee Bogan, a railwayman, and gave birth to a son, Nazareth Jr., in either 1915 or 1916. Lucille later divorced Nazareth and married James Spencer, who was 22 years younger than herself. \n\nShe first recorded [[vaudeville]] songs for [[Okeh Records]] in New York in 1923, with pianist Henry Callens.<ref name=\"AMG\"/>  Later that year she recorded \"Pawn Shop Blues\" in [[Atlanta, Georgia]], which was the first time a black blues singer had been recorded outside New York or Chicago.<ref name=williamson>{{Cite book|author=Nigel Williamson|title=The Rough Guide to The Blues|year=2007|isbn=1-84353-519-X}}</ref> In 1927 she began recording for [[Paramount Records]] in [[Grafton, Wisconsin]], where she recorded her first big success, \"Sweet Petunia\", which was covered by [[Blind Blake]]. She also recorded for [[Brunswick Records]], backed by [[Tampa Red]] and [[Cow Cow Davenport]]. {{Citation needed|date=April 2013}}\n\nBy 1930 her recordings had begun to concentrate on drinking and sex, with songs such as \"Sloppy Drunk Blues\" (covered by [[Leroy Carr]] and others) and \"Tricks Ain't Walkin' No More\" (later recorded by [[Memphis Minnie]]).  She also recorded the original version of \"[[Black Angel Blues]]\", which (as \"Sweet Little Angel\") was covered by [[B.B. King]] and many others. Trained in the rowdier [[juke joint]]s of the 1920s, many of Bogan's songs, most of which she wrote herself, have thinly-veiled humorous sexual references.  The theme of [[prostitution]], in particular, featured prominently in several of her recordings. In 1933 she returned to New York, and, apparently to conceal her identity, began recording as Bessie Jackson for the [[Banner Records|Banner]] ([[ARC (record company)|ARC]]) label.  She was usually accompanied on piano by [[Walter Roland]], with whom she recorded over 100 songs between 1933 and 1935, including some of her biggest commercial successes including \"Seaboard Blues\", \"Troubled Mind\", and \"Superstitious Blues\".<ref name=\"Russell\"/> \n\nHer other songs included \"Stew Meat Blues\", \"Coffee Grindin' Blues\", \"My Georgia Grind\", \"Honeycomb Man\", \"Mr. Screw Worm In Trouble\", and \"Bo Hog Blues\". Her final recordings with Roland and [[Josh White]] included two takes of \"Shave 'Em Dry\", recorded in New York on Tuesday March 5, 1935. The unexpurgated alternate take is notorious for its explicit sexual references, a unique record of the lyrics sung in after-hours adult clubs.<ref name=williamson/>  Another of her songs, \"B.D. Woman's Blues\", takes the position of a \"bull dyke\" (\"B.D.\"), with the line ''\"Comin' a time, B.D. women, they ain't gonna need no men\" \"They got a head like a sweet angel and they walk just like a natural man.\" \"They can lay their jive just like a natural man.\"''<ref name=\"AMG\"/>    \n\nShe appears not to have recorded after 1935, and spent some time managing her son's jazz group, Bogan's Birmingham Busters, before moving to [[Los Angeles]] shortly before her death from [[Atherosclerosis|coronary sclerosis]] in 1948.<ref name=\"Dead\">{{Cite web|url=http://thedeadrockstarsclub.com/1950.html|title=The Dead Rock Stars Club - The 1950s and Earlier|accessdate= November 22, 2011}}</ref> She is interred at the Lincoln Memorial Park, [[Compton, California]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&GRid=7636926|title= Lucille Anderson Bogan| work=Find a Grave|accessdate=November 1, 2012}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of classic female blues singers]]\n*[[List of dirty blues musicians]]\n*[[List of country blues musicians]]\n*[[Classic female blues]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.deltahaze.com/LucilleBogan.html Lucille Bogan biography]\n*[http://www.redhotjazz.com/bogan.html Lucille Bogan music catalog]\n\n{{Authority control|VIAF=76502628}}\n{{Persondata <!-- Metadata: see [[Wikipedia:Persondata]]. -->\n| NAME              = Bogan, Lucille\n| ALTERNATIVE NAMES =\n| SHORT DESCRIPTION = [[United States|American]] [[blues]] singer\n| DATE OF BIRTH     = April 1, 1897\n| PLACE OF BIRTH    = [[Amory, Mississippi]], U.S. \n| DATE OF DEATH     = August 10, 1948\n| PLACE OF DEATH    = [[Los Angeles, California]], U.S.}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Bogan, Lucille}}\n[[Category:1897 births]]\n[[Category:1948 deaths]]\n[[Category:Classic female blues singers]]\n[[Category:African-American female singers]]\n[[Category:American blues singers]]\n[[Category:American female singers]]\n[[Category:Dirty blues musicians]]\n[[Category:Bisexual musicians]]\n[[Category:LGBT African Americans]]\n[[Category:LGBT musicians from the United States]]\n[[Category:Okeh Records artists]]\n[[Category:Musicians from Birmingham, Alabama]]\n[[Category:Bisexual women]]\n[[Category:Cardiovascular disease deaths in California]]"}]}}}}
