It was there that Burks and his father built a 300 seater [[juke joint]] named the Bradley Ferry Country Club, where Burks duly led the [[house band]].<ref name=\"AMG\"/><ref name=\"Obit\"/> \n\nAfter the club closed in the mid 1980s, Burks was employed as a mechanic at [[Lockheed Martin]].  He continued to play at local clubs and [[music festival]]s, until 1997, when he recorded and produced his debut album, ''From the Inside Out''. The magazine, ''Blues Access'', stated it was \"the most impressive indie in recent memory\", and ''[[Living Blues]]'' described it as one of \"the best debut discs of the year.\"<ref name=\"AMG\"/> In 2001, [[Alligator Records]] signed Burks to a [[recording contract]], and he released ''Make It Rain'' with them the same year. ''Make It Rain'' was produced by Jim Gaines and [[Bruce Iglauer]].
