The family moved, first to [[Derry|Derry City]], where his younger brother D\u00f3nal was born in 1949, and then to [[Cork (city)|Cork]], where the two brothers were raised, and where Rory attended the [[The North Monastery|North Monastery School]]. Their father had played the [[accordion]] and sang with the Tir Chonaill Ceile Band whilst in Donegal; their mother Monica was a singer and acted with the Abbey Players in Ballyshannon. The Theatre in Ballyshannon where Monica once acted is now called the Rory Gallagher Theatre.\n\nBoth sons were musically inclined and encouraged by their parents. At age nine, Gallagher received his first guitar from them. He built on his burgeoning ability on [[ukulele]] in teaching himself to play the guitar and perform at minor functions. After winning a talent contest when he was twelve, Gallagher began performing in his adolescence with both his [[acoustic guitar]], and an electric guitar he bought with his prize money. However, it was his purchase three years later of a 1961 [[Fender Stratocaster]] for [[\u00a3]]100 that became his primary instrument and most associated with him for the span of his lifetime.<ref name=\"Modernguitar1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.modernguitars.com/archives/000931.html|title=Rory Gallagher: A Previously Unpublished Interview|last=Minhinnet|first=Ray|date=21 July 2005|publisher=Modern Guitar Magazine|accessdate=23 December 2009}}</ref>\n\nGallagher was initially attracted to [[skiffle]] after hearing [[Lonnie Donegan]] on the radio. Donegan frequently [[cover version|covered]] [[blues]] and [[folk music|folk]] performers from the United States. He relied entirely on radio programs and television. Occasionally, the jazz programs from the [[BBC]] would play some blues numbers, and he slowly found some song books for guitar, where he found the names of the actual composers of blues pieces. While still in school, playing songs by [[Buddy Holly]] and [[Eddie Cochran]], he discovered his greatest influence in [[Muddy Waters]]. Subsequently, Gallagher began experimenting with folk, blues, and rock music. Unable to find or afford record albums, Gallagher stayed up late to hear [[Radio Luxembourg (English)|Radio Luxembourg]] and [[American Forces Network|AFN]] where the radio brought him his only exposure to the actual songwriters and musicians whose music moved him most.<ref name=\"1991 radio influences\">{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGoTiOl2J8M|title=Rory Gallagher 2nd Interview 1991 Audio |last=Gallagher |first=Rory |year=1991 |work=Radio interview|accessdate=4 April 2010}}</ref> Influences he discovered, and cited as he progressed, included [[Woody Guthrie]], [[Big Bill Broonzy]], and [[Lead Belly]]. Initially, Gallagher struck out after just an acoustic sound.<ref name=\"Modernguitar1\"/> Singing and later using a brace for his harmonica, Gallagher taught himself to play [[slide guitar]].

Gallagher began to influence the band's repertoire, beginning its transition from mainstream pop music, skirting along some of [[Chuck Berry]]'s songs and by 1965, he had successfully moulded Fontana into \"The Impact\", with a change in their line-up into an [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]] group that played gigs in Ireland and Spain until disbanding in London.<ref name=\"Hunter\"/> Gallagher left with the bassist and drummer to perform as a trio in Hamburg, Germany.<ref name=\"Off.

Though he sold over thirty million albums worldwide, it was his marathon live performances that won him greatest acclaim.<ref name=buckley/> He is documented in the 1974 film ''Irish Tour '74'', directed by [[Tony Palmer]]. During the heightened periods of political unrest in Ireland, as other artists were warned not to tour, Gallagher was resolute about touring Ireland at least once a year during his career, winning him the dedication of thousands of fans, and in the process, becoming a role model for other aspiring young Irish musicians. Gallagher himself admitted in several interviews that at first there were not any international Irish acts until [[Van Morrison]], Gallagher, and later, [[Phil Lynott]] and [[Thin Lizzy]] grew popular during the 1970s. The line-up which included [[Rod de'Ath]] on drums and [[Lou Martin]] on keyboards, performed together between 1973 and 1978. However, he eventually dropped down to just bass, guitar and drums, and his act became a [[power trio]]. Other releases from that period include ''[[Against the Grain (Rory Gallagher album)|Against the Grain]]'', ''[[Calling Card]]'', ''[[Photo-Finish]]'' and ''[[Top Priority]]''.<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/> Gerry McAvoy has stated that the Gallagher band performed several TV and radio shows across Europe, including ''[[Beat-Club]]'' in [[Bremen (city)|Bremen]], Germany and the ''[[Old Grey Whistle Test]]''.<ref name=\"Shotgun1\">{{cite book|last=McAvoy |first=Gerry |author2=Chrisp, Pete |title=Riding Shotgun: 35 Years on the Road with Rory Gallagher and Nine Below Zero|publisher=Kent: SPG Triumph|date=3 June 2005|page=82|isbn=0-9550320-1-6 |accessdate=25 December 2009}}</ref> He recorded two [[Peel Sessions]], both in February 1973 and containing the same tracks, but only the first was broadcast.<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio1/johnpeel/artists/r/rorygallagher/ The Peel Sessions BBC Radio 1] retrieved 26 February 2011</ref> Along with [[Little Feat]] and [[Roger McGuinn]], Gallagher performed the first [[Rockpalast]] live concert at the [[Grugahalle]], [[Essen]], Germany in 1977.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rockpalastarchiv.de/rn1_e.html |title=Rockpalast Night 23.-24.July 1977: Rory Gallagher 2.3.1948\u201314.6.1995 |publisher=Rockpalast Archiv |date=September 1977 |accessdate=8 May 2009}}</ref>\n\nGallagher collaborated with [[Jerry Lee Lewis]]<ref name=\"Guinness Rockopedia\">{{cite book\n| first= David\n| last= Roberts\n| year= 1998\n| title= Guinness Rockopedia\n| edition= 1st\n| publisher= Guinness Publishing Ltd.\n| location= London\n| page= 242\n| isbn= 0-85112-072-5}}</ref> and Muddy Waters<ref name=\"russell\">{{cite book\n| first= Tony\n| last= Russell\n| year= 1997\n| title= The Blues: From Robert Johnson to Robert Cray\n| edition=\n| publisher= Carlton Books Limited\n| location= Dubai\n| page= 67\n| isbn= 1-85868-255-X}}</ref> on their respective ''London Sessions'' in the mid-1970s.

After ''Fresh Evidence'', he embarked on a tour of the United States. In addition he played with [[Box of Frogs]]\u2014a band formed in 1983 by former members of [[The Yardbirds]].

Connolly ordered a cherry red Stratocaster through Crowley's music shop in Cork in 1961. When Fender shipped a sunburst Stratocaster instead, it was put up on sale in 1963 as a second-hand instrument, which Gallagher bought in August 1963 for just shy of \u00a3100 at Crowley's Music Store on [[Cork (city)|Cork]]'s McCurtain Street.<ref>The shop was at 10 Merchants Quay at the time of purchase.</ref> Speaking about Gallagher's purchase of the famous Stratocaster his brother Donal recalled: \"His dream ambition was to have a guitar like Buddy Holly... This Stratocaster was in the store as a used instrument, it was 100 pounds... in today's money you couldn't even compare you might as well say it was a million pounds... my mother was saying we'll be in debt for the rest of our lives and Rory said well actually with a guitar like this I can play both parts, rhythm and lead, we won't need a rhythm player so I can earn more money and pay it off so the Stratocaster became his partner for life if you like.\" <ref>{{cite AV media | people=Thuillier, Ian (Director) | year=2010 | title=Ghost Blues The Story of Rory Gallagher  | location=Event occurs at 5:35}}</ref>\n\nThe guitar was extensively modified by Gallagher. The tuning pegs are odd (5 Sperzel pegs and one Gotoh), and all of these have been found to be replacements. Second, it is thought {{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} that the nut has been replaced and interchanged a number of times. Third, the scratchplate was changed during Gallagher's time with Taste.\n\nThe pick-ups \u2014 none of which are original \u2014 were also changed. The final modification was that of the wiring: Gallagher disconnected the bottom tone [[potentiometer|pot]] and rewired it so he had just a master tone control along with the master volume control. He also installed a 5-way selector switch in place of the vintage 3-way one.\n\nThe most notable effect that the years of touring have had on the guitar is the almost complete removal of its original sunburst finish.<ref name=\"Rorys strat\">{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxWi_FPa9Qw|title=Rory's Strat|work=Biography piece|publisher=YouTube|accessdate=14 December 2009}}</ref> Although the Strat was left abandoned in a rainy ditch for days after being stolen from the back of a tour van in Dublin, this is not believed to have caused any ill effect. All of the wear was caused by Rory's playing, not misuse. A borrowed Telecaster was also stolen at the same time but never recovered. When the Strat was recovered after two weeks, Gallagher swore he would never sell it or paint it after that.\n\nIt also had a period of time of having a replacement neck, with the original neck bowing due to the amount of moisture it absorbed during continuous touring. The neck was taken off and left to settle, and was eventually reunited with the Strat after returning to its correct shape. Other quirks include a 'hump' in the scratch plate which moves the neck pick-up closer to the neck on the bass side, and a replacement of all of the pick-ups, though this replacement was due to damage rather than the perception of a tonal inadequacy.\n\nOne final point of interest is that one of the clay double-dot inlays at the 12th fret fell out and was replaced with a plastic one, which is why it is whiter than the other clay inlays.\n\nOn Friday the 21st and Saturday 22 October 2011, Rory's brother Donal brought the guitar out of retirement to allow [[Joe Bonamassa]] to perform with it on his two nights at the London Hammersmith Apollo. Joe opened both night's performances with his rendition of \"Cradle Rock\" using Rory's Stratocaster. Photos and video of the performance can be seen on the official Rory Gallagher website.<ref name=\"Joe Bonamassa\">{{cite web|url=http://www.rorygallagher.com/#/news/2011/10/joe_bonamassa_plays_rorys_stratocaster|title=Joe Bonamassa Plays Rory's Stratocaster|publisher=Rorygallagher.com|accessdate=22 October 2011}}</ref>\n\nRory's biographer Marcus Connaughton believes the Strat was the key to Rory's sound. Rory could talk about it all night. \u2018It's dated November 1961 \u2013 in certain people's opinions this is when Fender hit their peak. I like the maple neck. Like on the earlier guitars, they\u2019re probably a bit more crisp, but there's a warmth to this, a mellowness because of the rosewood neck. This is the best, it's my life, this is my best friend. It's almost like knowing its weak spots are strong spots. I don\u2019t like to get sentimental about these things, but when you spend thirty years of your life with the same instrument it's like a walking memory bank of your life there in your arms.\u2019<ref>Rory Gallagher \u2013 His Life and Times by Marcus Connaughton, published by The Collins Press</ref>\n\n===Patrick Eggle 'JS Berlin Legend' electric guitar===\nIn April 2014 one of the last guitars owned by Gallagher, a [[Patrick Eggle]] 'JS Berlin Legend' was put up for auction in [[Cumbria]], England.

In general, however, he preferred smaller 'combo' amplifiers to the larger, more powerful [[Marshall Amplification#Marshall Stack|'stacks']] popular with rock and hard rock guitarists. To make up for the relative lack of power on stage, he would often link several different combo amps together.\n\nWhen Gallagher was with [[Taste (band)|Taste]], he used a single [[Vox (musical equipment)|Vox]] [[Vox AC30|AC30]] with a Dallas Rangemaster [[treble booster]] plugged into the 'normal' input. Examples of this sound can be heard on the Taste albums, as well as the album ''Live in Europe''. [[Brian May]], of the band [[Queen (band)|Queen]], has admitted in interviews that as a young man, he was inspired to use a [[Vox AC30]] and treble booster setup after meeting Gallagher and asking him how he got his sound. The British company, Flynn Amps, now makes a Rory Gallagher Signature Hawk Treble Booster pedal based on Gallagher's original unit. Gallagher also used [[Ibanez Tube Screamer]]s, an MXR Dyna Comp, and various Boss effects, often using a Flanger and Octaver.\n\nIn the early to mid-1970s, Gallagher began to use [[Fender Musical Instruments Corporation|Fender]] amplifiers in conjunction with a Hawk booster, most notably a Bassman and a Twin, both 1950s vintage. An example of this sound can be heard on the ''Irish Tour '74'' album. He also had a Fender Concert amplifier.\n\nIn the mid to late 1970s, when Gallagher was moving towards a hard rock sound, he experimented with [[Ampeg]] VT40 and VT22 amps. He also began using [[Marshall Amplification|Marshall]] combos. During this period and beyond, Gallagher used different combinations of amps on stage to achieve more power and to blend the tonal characteristics of different amps including Orange amplification.\n\nOn the introduction of the [[Boss Corporation|Boss]] ME-5 all-in-one floor based effects unit, Rory was known to have been an early adopter and used it readily it for his live work up until his death in mid 90s.\n\nNot that well known is his use of various German amplifiers. He used Stramp 2100a amps, which can be seen in his appearances on the German [[Beat Club]] program. Another company that hand built amplifiers for Gallagher was PCL Vintage Amp. The company is located in [[St. Wendel]] in the [[Saarland]] and they still produce high quality audio and guitar equipment.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pcl-vintageamp.de/bilder_history/rory_gallagher_lenz.jpg |title=Photograph |publisher=Pcl-vintageamp.de |accessdate=27 December 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Death==\nIn the later years of his life Gallagher developed a phobia of flying. To overcome this he received a prescription for a powerful sedative. This medication, combined with his alcohol use resulted in severe liver damage. Despite this he continued touring. By the time of his final performance on 10 January 1995 in the [[Netherlands]], he was visibly sick and the tour had to be cancelled. Gallagher was admitted to [[King's College Hospital]] in London in March 1995, and it was only then that the extent of his ill health became apparent: his liver was failing and the doctors determined that in spite of his young age a liver transplant was the only possible course of action.<ref name=\"Bnet\">{{cite web|last=Quigley|first=Maeve|title=Booze didn't kill my brother Rory, it was the drugs to help his fear|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Booze+didn%27t+kill+my+brother+Rory,+it+was+the+drugs+to+help+his+fear...-a084782459|accessdate=19 October 2012}}</ref> After 13 weeks in intensive care, while waiting to be transferred to a convalescent home, his health suddenly worsened when he contracted a [[staphylococcal]] ([[Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|MRSA]]) infection, and he died on 14 June 1995.<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/> He was unmarried and had no children.\n\nGallagher was buried in St Oliver's Cemetery, on the Clash Road just outside [[Ballincollig]] near Cork City, Ireland.
