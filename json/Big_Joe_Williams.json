In the early 1920s he worked in the [[Rabbit Foot Minstrels]] revue and recorded with the Birmingham Jug Band in 1930 for the [[Okeh Records|Okeh]] label.<ref name=\"Trail\"/>\n\nIn 1934, he was in [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]], where he met record producer [[Lester Melrose]] who signed him to [[Bluebird Records]] in 1935.  He stayed with Bluebird for ten years, recording such [[blues]] hits as \"[[Baby, Please Don't Go]]\" (1935) and \"[[Crawlin' King Snake]]\" (1941), both songs later covered by many other performers. He also recorded with other blues singers, including [[Sonny Boy Williamson I]], [[Robert Nighthawk]] and [[Peetie Wheatstraw]].<ref name=\"Trail\"/>\n\n==Festival fame==\nWilliams remained a noted blues artist in the 1950s and 1960s, with his guitar style and vocals becoming popular with [[folk music|folk]]-blues fans. He recorded for the [[Trumpet Records|Trumpet]], [[Delmark Records|Delmark]], [[Prestige Records|Prestige]] and [[Vocalion Records|Vocalion]] labels, among others. He became a regular on the concert and coffeehouse circuits, touring Europe and Japan in the late 1960s and early 1970s and performing at major U.S. music festivals.<ref name=\"Trail\"/>\n\nMarc Miller described a 1965 performance in [[Greenwich Village]]:\n:\"Sandwiched in between the two sets, perhaps as an afterthought, was the bluesman Big Joe Williams (not to be confused with the jazz and rhythm and blues singer Joe Williams who sang with Count Basie). He looked terrible. He had a big bulbous aneuristic protrusion bulging out of his forehead. He was equipped with a beat up old acoustic guitar which I think had nine strings and sundry homemade attachments and a wire hanger contraption around his neck fashioned to hold a kazoo while keeping his hands free to play the guitar. Needless to say, he was a big letdown after the folk rockers. My date and I exchanged pained looks in empathy for what was being done this Delta blues man who was ruefully out of place. After three or four songs the unseen announcer came on the p. a. system and said, \"Lets have a big hand for Big Joe Williams, ladies and gentlemen; thank you, Big Joe\". But Big Joe wasn't finished. He hadn't given up on the audience, and he ignored the announcer. He continued his set and after each song the announcer came over the p. a. and tried to politely but firmly get Big Joe off the stage. Big Joe was having none of it, and he continued his set with his nine-string acoustic and his kazoo. Long about the sixth or seventh song he got into his groove and started to wail with raggedy slide guitar riffs, powerful voice, as well as intense percussion on the guitar and its various accoutrements. By the end of the set he had that audience of jaded '60s rockers on their feet cheering and applauding vociferously. Our initial pity for him was replaced by wondrous respect. He knew he had it in him to move that audience, and he knew that thousands of watts and hundreds of decibels do not change one iota the basic power of a song\".<ref>[http://www.bluesforpeace.com/unsung-heroes/big-joe-williams.htm Miller, Marc. \"Big Joe Blues,\" ''Unsung Heroes of the Blues'']</ref>\n\nWilliams' guitar playing was in the [[Delta blues]] style, and yet was unique. He played driving rhythm and virtuosic lead lines simultaneously and sang over it all. He played with picks both on his thumb and index finger, plus his guitar was heavily modified. Williams added a rudimentary electric [[Pickup (music technology)|pick-up]], whose wires coiled all over the top of his guitar. He also added three extra strings, creating unison pairs for the first, second and fourth strings. His guitar was usually tuned to Open G, like such: (D2 G2 D3D3 G3 B3B3 D4D4), with a capo placed on the second fret to set the tuning to the key of A. During the 1920s and 1930s, Williams had gradually added these extra strings in order to keep other guitar players from being able to play his guitar. In his later years, he would also occasionally use a 12-string guitar with all strings tuned in unison to Open G. Williams sometimes tuned a six-string guitar to an interesting modification of Open G. In this modified tuning, the bass D string (D2) was replaced with a .08 gauge string and tuned to G4. The resulting tuning was (G4 G2 D3 G3 B3 D4), with the G4 string being used as a melody string. This tuning was used exclusively for slide playing.<ref>Bloomfield, Michael. ''Me and Big Joe'', ReSearch Publications,1989.</ref>\n\n==Back to Mississippi==\nHe died December 17, 1982 in [[Macon, Mississippi]].<ref name=\"Dead\">[http://thedeadrockstarsclub.com/1980.html Thedeadrockstarsclub.com] - accessed November 19, 2011</ref><ref name=\"Trail\"/> Williams was buried in a private cemetery outside Crawford near the Lowndes County line. His headstone was primarily paid for by friends and partially funded by a collection taken up among musicians at [[Clifford Antone]]'s nightclub in [[Austin, Texas]], organized by California music writer Dan Forte, and erected through the [[Mt. Zion Memorial Fund]] on October 9, 1994. Harmonica virtuoso and one time touring companion of Williams, [[Charlie Musselwhite]], delivered the eulogy at the unveiling. Williams' headstone epitaph, composed by Forte, proclaims him \"King of the 9 String Guitar.\"<ref>Cheseborough, Steve (2009).

Press of Mississippi, p. 217</ref>\n\nRemaining funds raised for Williams' memorial were donated by the [[Mt. Zion Memorial Fund]] to the [[Delta Blues Museum]] in order to purchase the last nine-string guitar from Williams' sister Mary May. The guitar purchased by the Museum is actually a 12-string guitar that Williams used in his later days. The last nine-string (a 1950s Kay cutaway converted to Williams' nine-string specifications) is missing at this time. Williams' previous nine-string (converted from a 1944 Gibson L-7) is in the possession of Williams' road agent and fellow traveler, Blewett Thomas.\n\nOne of Williams' nine-string guitars can be found under the counter of the Jazz Record Mart in [[Chicago]], which is owned by [[Bob Koester]], the founder of [[Delmark Records]]. Williams can be seen playing the nine-string guitar in ''American Folk-Blues Festival: The British Tours, 1963-1966'', a 2007 DVD release.\n\n[[File:Big Joe Williams, American Folk Blues Festival, Hamburg 1972 (Heinrich Klaffs Collection 49).jpg|thumb|right|260px|Big Joe Williams, [[American Folk Blues Festival]], Hamburg 1972.
