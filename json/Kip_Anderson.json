After featuring in his high school band, Anderson met his future business partner, Charles Derrick, at [[Columbia, South Carolina|Columbia]]'s radio station, [[WOIC]]. In 1959, Anderson's debut single \"I Wanna Be the Only One\", was eventually released by [[Vee-Jay Records]].<ref name=\"Obit\"/> His follow-up release \"Oh My Linda,\" featured guitar work from [[Mickey Baker]].<ref name=\"AMG\"/> Lack of commercial gains led to Anderson working as a disc jockey.<ref name=\"Obit\"/> \n\nEverlast Records released Anderson's third single \"I Will Cry\" (1962), and \"Here I Am, Try Me,\" and \"That's When the Crying Begins\" (1964) followed;  the latter reaching #79 on the [[Billboard Hot 100]]. His stock rose further with \"I'll Get Along,\" \"Woman How Do You Make Me Love You Like I Do,\" and \"Without a Woman\" (1966).<ref name=\"AMG\"/> \n\nIn 1967, Anderson released \"A Knife and a Fork\" on [[Checker Records|Checker]], which had been [[sound recording and reproduction|recorded]] at the Fame Studios in [[Alabama]]. \"A Knife and a Fork\" was a mid-tempo warning concerning his girlfriend's food consumption &ndash; \"girl, you gonna let a knife and a fork dig your grave\".<ref name=\"Obit\"/> The single entered the [[United States|US]] ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs|R&B]] [[record chart|chart]].  A follow-up release, \"You'll Lose a Good Thing\", issued on [[Excello Records|Excello]], also made the [[Top 40]] in the same chart. \"I Went Off and Cried\" (1968) remains alongside \"A Knife and a Fork\" as his most fondly remembered output. \" A Knife and a Fork\" was [[cover version|covered]] by [[Rockpile]] on their 1980 album, ''[[Seconds of Pleasure]]''.<ref name=\"AMG\"/><ref name=\"Obit\"/> \n\nA dependency on heroin started to affect his work by 1970, and Excello cancelled his [[recording contract]].<ref name=\"AMG\"/> Despite continuing to both record and perform in the 1970s, a ten year jail sentence in 1974 for possession of heroin, halted his activities. Later, Anderson opined about that time, \"It probably saved my life.\"<ref name=\"Obit\"/> While inside he formed a gospel group with other inmates, who performed under surveillance  at local churches and community events.<ref name=\"AMG\"/> \n\nOn release Anderson recorded a [[gospel music|gospel]] [[album]], before issuing more soul based material via [[Ichiban Records|Ichiban]].
