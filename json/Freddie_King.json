He is often mentioned as one of \"the Three Kings\" of electric blues guitar along with [[Albert King|Albert]] and [[B.B. King]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.12bar.de/bluesgreats.php|author=Gerd Klassen|title=The Three Kings of Blues - Albert, B.B. and Freddie King|publisher=12bar.de| accessdate=2010-05-22}}</ref>\n\nFreddie King based his guitar style on Texas and Chicago influences and was one of the first bluesmen to have a multi-racial backing band at live performances. He is best known for singles such as \"[[Have You Ever Loved A Woman]]\" (1960) and his [[Top 40]] hit \"[[Hide Away]]\" (1961). He is also known for albums such as the early, instrumental-packed ''[[Let's Hide Away and Dance Away with Freddy King]]'' (1961) and the later album ''Burglar'' (1974) which displayed King's mature versatility as both player and singer in a range of blues and funk styles.<ref>{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p406|pure_url=yes}}|author=Stephen Thomas Erlewine & Cub Koda|title=Freddie King|publisher=allmusic.com| accessdate=2009-05-14}}</ref>\n\nKing became an influential guitarist with hits for [[Federal Records]] in the early 1960s. He inspired musicians such as [[Jerry Garcia]], [[Dickey Betts]], [[Stevie Ray Vaughan]] and his brother [[Jimmie Vaughan]].<ref>{{cite book|title=The South West|author=Busby, Mark| publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|page=323}}</ref> His influence was also felt in Britain through recordings by blues artists such as [[Eric Clapton]],<ref>{{cite book|title=Clapton: the autobiography|author= Clapton, Eric| publisher=Broadway|page=41}}</ref>  [[Peter Green (musician)|Peter Green]],<ref>{{cite book|title=The big book of blues: a biographical encyclopedia|author=Santelli, Robert|publisher=Penguin|page=239}}</ref> and [[Chicken Shack]]. He was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 2012.\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life===\nWhen King was only six, his mother Ella Mae King and his uncle began teaching Freddie guitar. In autumn 1949, King and his family moved from [[Dallas]] to the [[South Side (Chicago)|South Side]] of [[Chicago]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.freddiekingsite.com/FKGrowingUpInTexas.html|author=Wanda King daughter of Freddie King|title=The Texas Cannonball: Growing Up in Texas|publisher=Estate of Freddie King|accessdate=2010-05-23}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> In 1952 King started working in a steel mill, the same year he married fellow Texas native Jessie Burnett, with whom he eventually had seven children.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.freddiekingsite.com/FKSweetHomeChicago.html|author=Unnamed daughter of Freddie King|title=The Texas Cannonball: Sweet Home Chicago|publisher=Estate of Freddie King|accessdate=2010-05-22}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.freddiekingsite.com/FKThePalaceoftheKing.html|author=Unnamed daughter of Freddie King|title=The Texas Cannonball: The Palace of the King|publisher=Estate of Freddie King|accessdate=2010-05-22}}</ref>\n\nAccording to his official birth certificate he was named \"Fred King\" at birth and his parents were Ella Mae King and J.T. Christian.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.freddiekingsite.com/FKGrowingupinTexas.html|author=Unnamed daughter of Freddie King|title=The Texas Cannonball: Growing Up in Texas|publisher=Estate of Freddie King|accessdate=2010-05-22}}</ref>\n\n===1950s===\nAlmost as soon as he had moved to Chicago, King started sneaking into South Side nightclubs, where he heard blues performed by [[Muddy Waters]], [[Howlin' Wolf]], [[T-Bone Walker]], [[Elmore James]], and [[Sonny Boy Williamson I|Sonny Boy Williamson]]. King formed his first band, the Every Hour Blues Boys, with guitarist [[Jimmie Lee Robinson]] and drummer Frank \"Sonny\" Scott. In 1952, while employed at the steel mill, an eighteen-year-old King occasionally worked as a [[sideman]] with such bands as the Little Sonny Cooper Band and Earl Payton's Blues Cats. In 1953 he recorded with the latter for Parrot Records, but these recordings were never released. As the 1950s went on, King played with several of Muddy Waters's sidemen and other Chicago mainstays, including guitarists [[Jimmy Rogers]], [[Robert Lockwood, Jr.]], [[Eddie Taylor]], [[Hound Dog Taylor]], bassist [[Willie Dixon]], pianist [[Memphis Slim]], and harpist [[Little Walter]].\n\nIn 1956 he cut his first record as a leader, for El-Bee Records. The A-side was a [[duet (music)|duet]] with a Margaret Whitfield, \"Country Boy,\",<ref>{{cite book|title=The Voice of the Blues: Classic Interviews from Living Blues Magazine|author=O'Neal, Jim, and Van Singel, Amy |publisher=Routledge| page=359}}</ref> and the B-side was a King vocal. Both tracks feature the guitar of Robert Lockwood, Jr., who during these same years was also adding rhythm backing and fills to Little Walter's records.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.freddiekingsite.com/FKSweetHomeChicago.html|author=The Freddie King Estate|title=Sweet Home Chicago| publisher=freddiekingsite.com| accessdate=2009-05-14}}</ref>\n\nKing was repeatedly rejected in auditions for the South Side's [[Chess Records]], the premier blues label, which was home to Muddy, Wolf, and Walter. The complaint was that Freddie King sang too much like B.B. King. A newer blues scene, lively with nightclubs and upstart record companies, was burgeoning on the West Side, though. Bassist and producer [[Willie Dixon]], during a late 1950s period of estrangement from Chess, had King come to [[Cobra Records]] for a session, but the results have never been heard. Meanwhile, King established himself as perhaps the biggest musical force on the West Side. King played along with [[Magic Sam]] and supposedly did uncredited backing guitar on some of Sam's tracks for [[Mel London]]'s [[Chief Records|Chief and Age]] labels,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.freddiekingsite.com/FKSweetHomeChicago.html|author=Unnamed daughter of Freddie King|title=Texas Cannonball: Sweet Home Chicago|publisher=Estate of Freddie King|accessdate=2010-05-23}}</ref> though King does not stand out anywhere.\n\n===Federal Records===\nIn 1959 King got to know [[Sonny Thompson]], pianist, producer, and A&R man for Cincinnati's [[King Records (USA)|King Records]] and King owner [[Syd Nathan]] signed King to the subsidiary [[Federal Records|Federal]] label in 1960.  King recorded his debut single for the label on August 26, 1960: \"Have You Ever Loved a Woman\" backed with \"[[You've Got to Love Her with a Feeling]]\" (again as \"Freddy\" King). From the same recording session at the King Studios in [[Cincinnati, Ohio]], King cut the instrumental \"Hide Away,\" which the next year reached #5 on the [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs|R&B Charts]] and #29 on the [[Pop Singles Chart]]s, an unprecedented accomplishment for a blues instrumental at a time when the genre was still largely unknown to white audiences. \"Hide Away\" was originally released as the B-side of \"I Love the Woman\". \"Hide Away\" was King's conglomeration of a theme by [[Hound Dog Taylor]] and parts by others, such as from \"The Walk\" by [[Jimmy McCracklin]] and \"Peter Gunn\", as credited by King. The song's title comes from Mel's Hide Away Lounge, a popular blues club on the West Side of Chicago.<ref>{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=song|id=t874621|pure_url=yes}}|title=Hideaway| author=Dahl, Bill|publisher=allmusic|accessdate=2009-05-14}}</ref> [[Willie Dixon]] later claimed that he had recorded King doing \"Hide Away\" for [[Cobra Records]] in the late 1950s, but such a version has never surfaced.<ref>{{cite book|title=I Am the Blues: The Willie Dixon Story|author=Willie Dixon with Don Snowden|publisher=Da Capo}}</ref> \"Hide Away\" has since become a [[blues standard]].\n\nAfter their success with \"Hide Away,\" King and [[Sonny Thompson]] recorded thirty instrumentals, including \"[[The Stumble]],\" \"Just Pickin',\" \"Sen-Sa-Shun,\" \"Side Tracked,\" \"San-Ho-Zay,\" \"High Rise,\" and \"The Sad Nite Owl\".<ref>{{cite book|title=Chicago Soul|author= Pruter, Robert|publisher=University of Illinois Press|page=236}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p406|pure_url=yes}}| title=Freddie King song credits|publisher=allmusic|accessdate=2009-05-14}}</ref> Vocal tracks continued to be recorded throughout this period, but often the instrumentals were marketed on their own merits as albums. During the Federal period King toured with many of the R&B acts of the day such as, [[Sam Cooke]], [[Jackie Wilson]] and [[James Brown]], who performed in the same concerts.\n\n===Cotillion, Shelter, RSO Records===\nKing's contract with Federal expired in 1966, and his first overseas tour followed in 1967. King's availability was noticed by producer and saxophonist [[King Curtis]], who had recorded a cover of \"Hide Away,\" with Cornell Dupree on guitar in 1962. Curtis signed King to [[Atlantic Records|Atlantic]] in 1968, which resulted in two [[LP record|LPs]], ''Freddie King Is a Blues Master'' (1969) and ''My Feeling for the Blues'' (1970), produced by Curtis for the Atlantic subsidiary [[Cotillion Records]].<ref>{{cite book|title=texas Music|author=Hardy, Laing, Barnard and Perretta| publisher=Schirmer Books|page=251}}</ref>\n\nIn 1969 King hired Jack Calmes as his manager, who secured him an appearance at the 1969 Texas Pop Festival, alongside [[Led Zeppelin]] and others,<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.texaspopfestival.com|author=Hayner, Richard.C|title=The Texas Pop Festival|publisher=texaspopfestival.com|accessdate=2009-05-14}}</ref> and this led to King's being signed to [[Leon Russell]]'s new label, [[Shelter Records]]. The company treated King as an important artist, flying him to Chicago to the former [[Chess Records|Chess studios]] for the recording of ''Getting Ready'' and gave him a backing line-up of top session musicians, including rock pianist [[Leon Russell]].<ref>{{cite web| url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r572199|pure_url=yes}}|title=Getting Ready credits|publisher=almusic.com|accessdate=2009-05-14}}</ref> Three albums were made during this period, including blues classics and new songs like, \"Goin' Down\" written by Russell and [[Don Nix]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Texas Music|author=Kosta, Rick|publisher=St. Martin's Press|page=187}}</ref>\n\nKing performed alongside the big rock acts of the day, such as [[Eric Clapton]]<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.pattofan.com/MikePatto/nme8-7-76.htm|title=Crystal Palace Bowl Concert|author=Tony Stewart, NME|publisher=pattofan.com| accessdate=2010-01-23}}</ref> and for a young, mainly [[White people|white]] audience, along with white tour drummer Gary Carnes for three years, before signing to [[RSO Records|RSO]]. In 1974 he recorded ''Burglar'', for which [[Tom Dowd]] produced the track \"Sugar Sweet\" at Criteria Studios in [[Miami]], with guitarists Clapton and slide guitarist [[George Terry]], drummer [[Jamie Oldaker]] and bassist [[Carl Radle]]. [[Mike Vernon (producer)|Mike Vernon]] produced all the other tracks.<ref>\n{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r572195|pure_url=yes}}\n|author=Viglione, Joe\n|title=Burglar\n|publisher= allmusic.com\n|accessdate=2009-05-08}}\n</ref>  Vernon also produced a second album ''Larger than Life''<ref>\n{{cite web\n|url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r578766|pure_url=yes}}\n|title=Larger than life\n|publisher =allmusic.com\n|accessdate=2009-05-08}}\n</ref>\nwith King, for the same label. Vernon brought in other notable musicians for both albums such as [[Bobby Tench]] of [[The Jeff Beck Group]], to complement King<ref>\n{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p130948|pure_url=yes}}\n|title=Bobby Tench\n|publisher=allmusic.com\n|accessdate=2009-05-08}}\n</ref>\n===Death===\nNear-constant touring took its toll on King (he was on the road almost 300 days out of the year), and in 1976 he began suffering [[stomach ulcer]]s. His health quickly deteriorated and he died on December 28 of complications from that and acute [[pancreatitis]] at the age of 42.\n\nAccording to those who knew him, King's untimely death was due to both stress and poor diet (he was in the habit of consuming [[Bloody Mary (cocktail)|Bloody Mary]]s in lieu of solid food so as not to waste time when setting up shows).\n\n==Playing style and technique==\nKing had an intuitive style, often creating guitar parts with vocal nuances.<ref>{{cite book|title=All over the map. True heroes of Texas music|author=Corcoran, Joseph, Michael| publisher=University of Texas Press|page=54}}</ref> He achieved this by using the open string sound associated with Texas blues and the raw, screaming tones of West Side Chicago blues. As King combined both the Texas and Chicago sounds, this gave his music a more contemporary outlook than many Chicago bands who were still performing 1950s-style music, and he befriended the younger generation of blues musicians. In his early career he played a gold top [[Gibson Guitars|Gibson]] [[Gibson Les Paul|Les Paul]] with [[P-90]] pickups through a Gibson GA-40 amplifier, later moving on to [[Gibson ES-355]] guitars,<ref>{{cite book|title=The Early Years of the Les Paul Legacy 1915-1963|author=Lawrence, Robb|publisher=Hal Leonard Corporation|page=247}}</ref> using a plastic thumb pick and a metal index-finger pick to achieve an aggressive finger attack, a style he learned from [[Jimmy Rogers]]. He had a relatively more aggressive and creative style of improvisation than others such as, [[B.B. King]] and [[Albert King]], considered by many to be a more exploratory and less traditional approach. Despite an often avowed desire to play slide guitar, King confessed that he could not due to his large fingers preventing him from a light enough touch.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}\n\nKing's later years (after 1970) were marked by a shift towards more of a hard, rock-like style, presumably in an effort to reach white audiences better.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}} He also largely quit performing new material in lieu of simply covering songs from B.B. King and other blues musicians.\n\n==Awards and recognition==\nIn 1993 by proclamation from the Texas Governor [[Ann Richards]] September 3, 1993, was declared Freddie King Day. This is an honor reserved for Lone Star legends, such as [[Bob Wills]] and [[Buddy Holly]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/KK/fkimt.html|author=Van Beveren,Amy|title=Freddie King|publisher=tshaonline.org}}</ref>  Freddie King placed 15th in ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine\u2032s list of the 100 greatest guitarists of all time<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/100-greatest-guitarists-20111123/freddy-king-19691231|title=100 Greatest guitarists.
