He is best known for his association and work with [[Robert Nighthawk]].<ref name=\"AMG\">{{cite web |url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p127797/biography|pure_url=yes}}|title=Houston Stackhouse |author=Ankeny, Jason |publisher=[[Allmusic]] |accessdate=August 26, 2010}}</ref> Although Stackhouse was not especially noted as a guitarist nor singer, Nighthawk showed gratitude for being taught to play by Stackhouse, by backing him on a number of recordings in the late 1960s. Apart from a tour to Europe, Stackhouse confined his performing around the [[Mississippi Delta]].<ref name=\"AMG\"/>\n\n==Biography==\nStackhouse was born '''Houston Goff''', in [[Wesson, Mississippi|Wesson]], [[Mississippi]], and was the son of Garfield Goff.  He was raised by James Wade Stackhouse on the Randall Ford Plantation, and Stackhouse only learned the details of his parentage when he applied for a passport in later life.<ref name=\"Encyc\"/>\n\nRelocating in his teenage years with his family to [[Crystal Springs, Mississippi]], he became inspired listening to [[Gramophone record|records]] by [[Blind Blake]], [[Blind Lemon Jefferson]] and [[Lonnie Johnson (musician)|Lonnie Johnson]], and by local musicians. By the late 1930s, Stackhouse had played guitar around the Delta states and worked with members of the [[Mississippi Sheiks]], plus [[Robert Johnson (musician)|Robert Johnson]], [[Charlie McCoy]] and [[Walter Vinson]].<ref name=\"Encyc\"/>  He also teamed up with his distant cousin, [[Robert Nighthawk]],<ref name=\"Cascade\">{{cite web |url=http://www.cascadeblues.org/History/RobertNighthawk.htm|title=Robert Nighthawk |author=Johnson, Greg|publisher=Cascadeblues.org|accessdate=August 26, 2010}}</ref> whom he taught how to play guitar.<ref name=\"Herzhaft\">{{cite book\n| first= G\u00e9rard\n| last= Herzhaft\n| year= 1997\n| title= Encyclopedia of the blues\n| edition= 2nd\n| publisher= The University of Arkansas Press \n| location= Fayetteville\n| isbn= 1-55728-452-0\n| page= 161}}</ref> Originally a [[fan (person)|fan]] of [[Tommy Johnson (blues musician)|Tommy Johnson]], Stackhouse often [[cover version|covered]] his songs.<ref name=\"AMG\"/> In 1946, Stackhouse moved to [[Helena, Arkansas]] to live near to Nighthawk, and for a time was a member of Nighthawk\u2019s band, playing on [[KFFA (AM)|KFFA]] radio.<ref name=\"Encyc\"/> \n\nHe split from Nighthawk in 1947 and alongside the [[drummer]] James \"Peck\" Curtis, appeared on KFFA's \"[[King Biscuit Time]]\" programme, with the  guitar player [[Joe Willie Wilkins]] plus pianists [[Pinetop Perkins]] and Robert Traylor. [[Sonny Boy Williamson II]] then rejoined the show, and that combo performed across the Delta, using their radio presence to advertise their concert performances.<ref name=\"Encyc\"/> \n\nStackhouse tutored both [[Jimmy Rogers]] and [[Sammy Lawhorn]] on guitar techniques. Between 1948 and 1954, Stackhouse worked during the day at the [[Chrysler]] plant in [[West Helena, Arkansas]], and played the blues in his leisure time. He did not move from the [[Southern United States|South]], unlike many of his contemporaries, and continued to perform locally into the 1960s with [[Frank Frost]], [[Boyd Gilmore]] and Baby Face Turner. In May 1965, Sonny Boy Williamson II, who was by then back on \"King Biscuit Time\", utilised Stackhouse when he was recorded in concert by [[Chris Strachwitz]] of [[Arhoolie Records]].  The recording was issued under Williamson's name, titled ''King Biscuit Time''. Shortly afterwards, Williamson died, but Stackhouse continued briefly on the radio program, back in tandem with Nighthawk.<ref name=\"Encyc\"/>\n\nIn 1967, [[George Mitchell (music historian)|George Mitchell]] recorded Stackhouse in [[Dundee, Mississippi]]. Named the Blues Rhythm Boys, Stackhouse was joined by both Curtis and Nighthawk, although the latter died shortly after the recording was made. Another field researcher, David Evans, recorded Stackhouse in Crystal Springs, but by 1970 following the deaths of both Curtis and Mason, Stackhouse had moved on to [[Memphis, Tennessee]].  There he resided with his old friend Joe Willie Wilkins and his wife Carrie. At the height of the blues revival Stackhouse toured with Wilkins, and the Memphis Blues Caravan, and appeared at various [[music festival]]s. His lone trip overseas saw Stackhouse play in 1976 in [[Vienna]], [[Austria]].<ref name=\"Encyc\"/>\n\nEarlier in February 1972, Stackhouse recorded an album titled ''Cryin' Won't Help You''. It was released on [[Compact disc|CD]] in 1994.<ref name=\"Compilation album\">{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r303455|pure_url=yes}}|title=Allmusic ((( Cryin Won't Help You > Overview )))}}</ref>\n\nStackhouse returned to Helena, where he died in September 1980, at the age of 69.
