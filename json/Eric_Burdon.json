The original band was the [[Alan Price]] Combo, which formed in 1958;<ref>Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock and Roll</ref> they became The Animals shortly after Burdon joined the band. The Animals combined [[electric blues]] with rock and in the USA were one of the leading bands of the [[British Invasion]]. Along with [[the Beatles]], [[the Rolling Stones]], [[the Dave Clark Five]], and [[the Kinks]], the group introduced British music and fashion. Burdon's powerful voice can be heard on the Animals' singles \"[[The House of the Rising Sun]]\", \"[[Sky Pilot (song)|Sky Pilot]]\", \"[[Monterey (song)|Monterey]]\", \"[[I'm Crying]]\", \"[[Boom Boom (John Lee Hooker song)|Boom Boom]]\", \"[[Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood]]\", \"[[Bring It On Home to Me]]\", \"[[Baby Let Me Take You Home]]\", \"[[It's My Life (The Animals song)|It's My Life]]\", \"[[We Gotta Get out of This Place]]\", \"[[Don't Bring Me Down (The Animals song)|Don't Bring Me Down]]\", and \"[[See See Rider]]\".\n\n[[File:Eric Burdon & the Animals.jpg|thumb|220px|left|Eric Burdon and the Animals]]\nBy late 1966, the other original members, including keyboardist [[Alan Price]], had left. Burdon and drummer [[Barry Jenkins]] reformed the group as ''Eric Burdon and The Animals''. This more [[psychedelic rock|psychedelic]] incarnation featured future [[Family (band)|Family]] member [[John Weider]] and was sometimes called ''Eric Burdon and the New Animals''. Keyboardist [[Zoot Money]] joined during 1968 until they split up in 1969. This group's hits included the ballad \"[[San Franciscan Nights]]\", the [[grunge]]\u2013[[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]]-pioneering \"[[When I Was Young]]\", \"[[Monterey (song)|Monterey]]\", the [[Opposition to the Vietnam War|anti-Vietnam anthem]] \"[[Sky Pilot (song)|Sky Pilot]]\", and the progressive cover of \"[[Ring of Fire (song)|Ring of Fire]]\".\n\nIn 1975, the original [[The Animals|Animals]] reunited and recorded an album called ''Before We Were So Rudely Interrupted'', released in 1977 and overlooked due to the dawning of [[Punk music|punk]]. In May 1983, The Animals reunited with their original line-up and released the album ''[[Ark (The Animals album)|Ark]]'' on 16 June 1983, along with the singles \"[[The Night (The Animals song)|The Night]]\" and \"Love Is For All Time\". A world tour followed, and the concert at [[Wembley Arena]], London, recorded on 31 December 1983, was released in 1984 as ''Rip it to Shreds''. Their concert at the Royal Oak Theatre in April 1984 was released in 2008 as ''Last Live Show''; the band members were augmented by [[Zoot Money]], Nippy Noya, [[Steve Gregory]], and [[Steve Grant]]. The original Animals broke up for the last time at the end of 1984.\n\nAlthough the band Burdon formed in the late 1960s was sometimes called ''Eric Burdon and the New Animals,'' it wasn't until 1998 that the name ''Eric Burdon and the New Animals'' was officially adopted. The 1998 band had bassist [[Dave Meros]], guitarist Dean Restum, drummer [[Aynsley Dunbar]] and keyboard guitarist [[Neal Morse]]. They recorded ''Live at the Coach House'' on 17 October 1998, released on video and DVD in December that year. In 1999 they released ''The Official Live Bootleg No. 2'' and in August 2000 ''The Official Live Bootleg 2000'', with [[Martin Gerschwitz]] on keyboards.\n\nIn June 2003, he formed another ''Eric Burdon and the Animals'', with keyboardist Martin Gerschwitz, bassist [[Dave Meros]], guitarist Dean Restum, and drummer [[Bernie Pershey]]. They disbanded in 2005. During 2008 Burdon toured again as ''Eric Burdon and the Animals'' with a variable line-up of backing musicians.<ref>Eric Burdon vocals and percussion, [[Red Young]] keyboards and vocals, [[Hilton Valentine]] guitar and vocals, Paula O'Rourke bass and vocals, Billy Watts guitar, [[Steve Conte]] lead guitar, Tony Braunagel drums, Herman Matthews drums, Steve Murphy drums, Bobby Furgo violin</ref>\n\nOn 13 December 2008, Burdon lost a three-year legal battle to win the name \"The Animals\" in the UK. Drummer John Steel now owns the rights in the UK only. Burdon still tours as Eric Burdon and the Animals, but is prevented from using the name \"The Animals\" in Britain while the case is under appeal. Steel was a member in its heyday and left before the band split up in 1966. Steel later played in various reunion versions of the band with Burdon.<ref>Daniel Boffey, [http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1094461/Eric-Burdon-loses-battle-Animal.html Eric Burdon loses battle to be the only Animal], ''[[The Daily Mail]]'', 14 December 2008.</ref>\n\n[[Image:Eric burdon and war concert flyer.jpg|thumb|left|2008 Reunion flyer]]\n\n===War===\nDuring 1969, while living in San Francisco, Burdon joined forces with Californian [[funk rock]] band [[War (band)|War]]. The resulting album was entitled ''[[Eric Burdon Declares \"War\"]]'' which produced the singles \"[[Spill the Wine]]\" and \"[[Tobacco Road (song)|Tobacco Road]]\". A [[double album|two-disc set]] entitled ''[[The Black-Man's Burdon]]'', was released later in September 1970. The singles from the double album, \"[[Paint It, Black]]\" and \"[[They Can't Take Away Our Music]]\", had moderate success during 1971. During this time Burdon collapsed on the stage during a concert, caused by an [[asthma]] attack, and War continued the tour without him.\n\nIn 1976, a compilation album, ''[[Love Is All Around (album)|Love Is All Around]]'', released by [[ABC Records]], included recordings of Eric Burdon with War doing a live version of \"[[Paint it, Black]]\" and a cover of [[The Beatles]] song \"[[A Day in the Life]].\" The band also featured ex-NFL star [[Deacon Jones]] who coined the term \"[[quarterback sack]]\" and sang on the band's 1975 song \"[[Why Can't We Be Friends? (song)|Why Can't We Be Friends?]]\"\n\nEric Burdon and War were reunited for the first time in 37 years, to perform an Eric Burdon & War reunion at the concert at the [[Royal Albert Hall]] London on 21 April 2008. The concert coincided with a major reissue campaign by Rhino Records (UK), which released all the War albums including ''Eric Burdon Declares \"War\"'' and ''The Black-Man's Burdon''.{{Clear left}}\n\n[[File:Eric Burdon at the 2008 Daffodil Festival.jpg|thumb|Eric Burdon at the Daffodil Festival in Pierce County, Washington, in 2008]]\n\n===Solo career===\nBurdon began a solo career in 1971 with [[the Eric Burdon Band]], continuing with a [[hard rock]]\u2013[[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]]\u2013funk style. In August 1971, he recorded the album ''[[Guilty (1971 album)|Guilty]]!'' which featured the [[blues shouter]] [[Jimmy Witherspoon]], and also Ike White of the [[San Quentin Prison]] Band. In 1973, the band performed at the [[Reading Festival]] and in 1974 they travelled to New York City. At the end of 1974, the band released the album ''Sun Secrets'' and this was followed by the album ''Stop'' in 1975. Burdon moved to Germany in 1977 and recorded the album ''Survivor'' with a line-up including guitarist [[Alexis Korner]] and keyboardist [[Zoot Money]]; the album also had a line-up of four guitarists and three keyboard players and is known for its interesting [[album cover]], which depicts Burdon screaming. The album was produced by former Animal's bassist Chas Chandler. The original release included a booklet of illustrated lyrics done in ink by Burdon himself.\n\nIn May 1978, he recorded the album ''[[Darkness Darkness]]'' at the Roundwood House in [[County Laois]], Republic of Ireland, using [[Ronnie Lane's Mobile Studio]] and featuring guitarist and vocalist [[Bobby Tench]] from [[the Jeff Beck Group]], who had left [[Streetwalkers]] a few months before. The album was eventually released in 1980.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/darkness-darkness-mw0001879695 |title=Darkness Darkness - Eric Burdon &#124; Songs, Reviews, Credits, Awards |publisher=AllMusic |date= |accessdate=2014-04-24}}</ref> During January 1979, Burdon changed his band for a tour taking in [[Hamburg]], Germany, and the Netherlands.\n\nOn 28 August 1982, \"The Eric Burdon Band\" including Red Young (keyboards) performed at the [[Rockpalast]] Open Air Concert in [[Lorelei]], Germany. Following this Burdon toured heavily with his solo project from March 1984 to March 1985, taking in UK, Spain, Germany, Sweden, Canada and Australia. In 1986, Burdon published his autobiography entitled ''I Used To Be An Animal, But I'm Alright Now''.\n\nIn March 1979, he played a concert in [[Cologne]] and changed the band's name to \"Eric Burdon's Fire Department\", whose line-up included backing vocalist Jackie Carter of [[Silver Convention]], Bertram Engel of [[Udo Lindenberg]]'s \"Panik Orchester\" and Jean-Jaques Kravetz. In mid 1980, they recorded the album ''The Last Drive''. \"Eric Burdon's Fire Department\" toured Europe with this line-up and Paul Millins and [[Louisiana Red]] made special appearances in Spain and Italy. By December 1980, the band had broken up.\n\nIn April 1981, Christine Buschmann began to film ''[[Comeback (film)|Comeback]]'' with Burdon as the star. They created a new \"Eric Burdon Band\" whose line-up included [[Louisiana Red]], Tony Braunagle, John Sterling and [[Snuffy Walden]]. This band recorded live tracks in Los Angeles. They also recorded in Berlin with another line-up, the only remaining member being John Sterling. In September 1981, the final scenes of ''Comeback'' were shot in the Berlin Metropole and Burdon and his band continued to tour through Australia and North America. A studio album titled ''[[Comeback (album)|Comeback]]'' was released in 1982. The 1983 album ''[[Power Company (album)|Power Company]]'' also included songs recorded during the ''Comeback'' project.\n\nIn 1988, he put together a band with 15 musicians including [[Andrew Giddings]] \u2013 keyboards, Steve Stroud \u2013 bass, Adrian Sheppard \u2013 drums, Jamie Moses \u2013 guitar and four backing vocalists to record the album ''[[I Used To Be An Animal]]'' in [[Malibu, California|Malibu]], in the United States. In 1990, Eric Burdon's [[cover version]] of \"[[Sixteen Tons]]\" was used for the film ''[[Joe Versus the Volcano]]''. The song, which played at the beginning of the film, was also released as a single. He also recorded the singles \"We Gotta Get out of this Place\" with [[Katrina & The Waves]] and \"No Man's Land\" with [[Tony Carey]] and [[Anne Haigis]]. Later in 1990, he had a small line-up of an ''Eric Burdon Band'' featuring Jimmy Zavala (sax and harmonica), [[Dave Meros]](bass), Jeff Naideau (keyboards), Thom Mooney (drums) and John Sterling (guitar) before he began a tour with [[The Doors]] guitarist [[Robby Krieger]] and they appeared at a concert from [[Ventura, California|Ventura Beach]], California, which was released as a DVD on 20 June 2008.\n\nOn 13 April 2004, he released a \"comeback\" album, ''[[My Secret Life (Eric Burdon album)|My Secret Life]]'', which was his first album with new recordings for 16 years. When [[John Lee Hooker]] died in 2001, Burdon had written the song \"Can't Kill the Boogieman\" the co-writers of the songs, on the album, were Tony Braunagel and [[Marcelo Nova]]. In 2005, they released a live album, ''[[Athens Traffic Live]]'', with special DVD bonus material and a bonus studio track and disbanded in November 2005. He began a short touring as \"The Blues Knights\".\n\nOn 27 January 2006, he released his blues\u2013R&B album ''[[Soul of a Man (Eric Burdon album)|Soul of a Man]]''. This album was dedicated to [[Ray Charles]] and [[John Lee Hooker]]. The cover of the album was a picture which was sent to Burdon a few years before. Burdon then formed a new band, with the following members: [[Red Young]] (keyboards), Paula O'Rourke (bass), [[Eric McFadden]] (guitar), Carl Carlton (guitar), and [[Wally Ingram]] (drums). They also performed at the [[Lugano]] Festival and in 2007 he toured as the headlining act of the \"Hippiefest\" line-up, produced and hosted by [[Country Joe McDonald]].\n\nBurdon, at 71, recorded an E.P. with [[Cincinnati]] garage band [[the Greenhornes]] called, simply, ''Eric Burdon & the Greenhornes''. The album was recorded at an all-analogue recording studio,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.welcometo1979.com |title=Welcome to 1979 |publisher=Welcometo1979.com |accessdate=2014-04-24}}</ref> and released on 23 November 2012 as part of [[Record Store Day]]'s \"Black Friday.\"\n\nIn 2013, Eric Burdon came out with a new album called, \"Til Your River Runs Dry.\" The lead single off the album was called, \"Water\" and was inspired by a conversation he had with Former Soviet Premier Mikhail Gorbachev.<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://ultimateclassicrock.com/eric-burdon-til-your-river-runs-dry-album-review/ |title=Eric Burdon, \"Til Your River Runs Dry\u2019 \u2013 Album Review |publisher=Ultimateclassicrock.com |date=2013-02-11 |accessdate=2014-04-24}}</ref><ref>[http://www.therevue.org/eric-burdon-til-your-river-runs-dry/] {{dead link|date=April 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Other associations===\nIn 1991, Burdon and [[Brian Auger]] formed the \"Eric Burdon \u2013 Brian Auger Band\" with the following line-up: Eric Burdon \u2013 vocals, Brian Auger \u2013 keyboards, vocals, [[Dave Meros]] \u2013 bass, vocals, [[Don Kirkpatrick]] \u2013 guitar, vocals, and [[Paul Crowder (filmmaker)|Paul Crowder]] \u2013 drums, vocals.

Director [[Michelangelo Antonioni]] wanted to use him as a musician in a club scene, but Burdon turned the role down because he had acted in films before wherein he sang songs. He disbanded The Animals and went to California, where he met [[Jim Morrison]] and came to the realisation that his real inspiration was acting.\n\nLater, he turned down major roles in ''[[Zabriskie Point (film)|Zabriskie Point]]'' and ''[[Performance (film)|Performance]]'' (both 1970).\n\nIn 1973, he formed [[the Eric Burdon Band]] and recorded the soundtrack for his own film project, ''Mirage''. He spent much money to make this film, produced as a film for Atlantic. The film and the soundtrack were to be released in July 1974, but somehow they never were. The soundtrack was released in 2008.\n\nIn 1979, he acted in the TV film ''The 11th Victim'', then in the German film ''Gibbi \u2013 Westgermany'' (1980).
