Kimbrough was a large woman, and was [[nickname]]d \"the Kansas City Butterball\".<ref name=\"AMG\"/><ref>{{cite book\n| first= Rick\n| last= Kennedy\n| year= 1999\n| title= Little labels &ndash; big sound: small record companies and the rise of American music\n| edition= 1st\n| publisher= Indiana University Press \n| location= Bloomington, Indiana\n| isbn= 0-253-33548-5\n| page= 16}}</ref> Her recording career lasted from 1924 to 1929, however [[Allmusic]] [[music journalism|journalist]] Burgin Mathews stated \"Kimbrough's vocal power, and the unique arrangements of several of her best pieces, rank her as one of the sizable talents of the 1920s blues tradition.<ref name=\"AMG\"/>\n\n==Biography==\nKimbrough was born in [[West Bottoms]], [[Kansas City, Missouri]], and retained close links to her local community. She was managed by Winston Holmes, himself a local [[musician]] and [[Promoter (entertainment)|music promoter]].<ref name=\"AMG\"/> Her music career began in the early part of the 1920s, when she performed in Kansas City's [[nightclub]]s and [[speakeasy]]s.<ref name=\"Trail\"/>  In 1924 she undertook her first [[sound recording and reproduction|recording]] session at  [[Paramount Records]], where she was recorded alongside [[Ma Rainey]]. Her earliest recordings used the twins Milas ([[banjo]]) and Miles Pruitt ([[guitar]]), whilst she was later backed by [[Jimmy Blythe]] ([[piano]]).<ref name=\"AMG\"/> In 1925 she shared [[recording studio]] space with [[Papa Charlie Jackson]]. The same year she cut some tracks for the Holmes owned [[Merrit Records]].<ref name=\"Trail\"/> \n\nAs time progressed, Kimbrough recorded and performed using a number of pseudonyms.  Whilst she used her married name, Lottie Beaman, on almost half of her tracks, Holmes suggested for her 1926 recording sessions that she was renamed Lena Kimbrough.  More pertinently her manager substituted a photograph of Kimbrough's more photogenic sister, Estella, for Lottie's publicity purposes.<ref name=\"AMG\"/>  She also appeared billed as either Clara Cary or Mae Moran. She further recorded in [[Richmond, Indiana]], and alternate namings were used for issues by [[Gennett Records|Gennett]], [[Champion Records|Champion]] (billed as Lottie Emerson), [[Supertone Records|Supertone]] (as Lottie Brown) and Superior Records (as Martha Johnson).<ref name=\"Trail\">{{cite web |url=http://www.thebluestrail.com/artists/mus_lkim.htm|title=Lottie Kimbrough|author=|publisher=Thebluestrail.com|accessdate=November 3, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite book\n| first= Paul\n| last= Oliver\n| year= 1970\n| title= Yonder Come the Blues: the evolution of a genre\n| edition= 1st\n| publisher= Cambridge University Press \n| location= Cambridge, England\n| isbn= 0-521-78777-7\n| page= 287}}</ref> Her Gennett sessions included the tracks \"Rolling Log Blues\" and \"Goin' Away Blues\", which music journalist Tony Russell described as having \"haunting beauty\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sundayblues.org/archives/tag/james-cotton |title=James Cotton|author=|publisher=Sundayblues.org |accessdate=November 3, 2010}}</ref>\n\nKimbrough's brother Sylvester appeared with her in [[vaudeville]], and in 1926 he supplied recording accompaniment with Paul Banks' Kansas City Trio. Nevertheless, it was Kimbrough's musical collaboration with Holmes which provided her better known recordings.  Holmes supplied a series of [[Yodeling|yodel]]s, and vocalised [[Bird vocalization|bird calls]] and [[train whistle]]s on both \"Lost Lover Blues\" and \"Wayward Girl Blues\" (1928). Miles Pruitt was part of this recording and was a regular partner throughout Kimbrough's recording and concert career.  He was featured again when Kimbrough recorded her final session in November 1929.<ref name=\"AMG\">{{cite web |url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=lottie-kimbrough-p93865/biography|pure_url=yes}} |title=Lottie Kimbrough|author=Mathews, Burgin |publisher=[[Allmusic]] |accessdate=November 3, 2010}}</ref>\n\nHer self-penned song \"Rolling Log Blues\" has subsequently been recorded by [[Jo Ann Kelly]], [[Woody Mann]], [[Son House]], [[The Blues Band]], [[Rory Block]], [[Eric Bibb]], and [[Maria Muldaur]].<ref>{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=lottie-kimbrough-p93865/songs/songs-composed-by|pure_url=yes}} |title=Allmusic ((( Lottie Kimbrough > Songs > Songs Composed By )))}}</ref>\n\nLittle is known of her life beyond her recording career.<ref name=\"Trail\"/>\n\n==Selected compilation albums==\n*''Lottie Kimbrough & Winston Holmes (1928-1929)'' - Wolf<ref>{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=lottie-kimbrough--winston-holmes-1928-1929-r211805|pure_url=yes}} |title=Allmusic ((( Lottie Kimbrough & Winston Holmes (1928-1929) > Lottie Kimbrough > Overview )))}}</ref>\n*''Kansas City Blues 1924-1929'' - [[Document Records|Document]], 1993<ref name=\"Fiend\">{{cite web |url=http://record-fiend.blogspot.com/2009/12/kansas-city-blues-1924-1929-document.html |title=Kansas City Blues 1924-1929 (Document, 1993)|author=|publisher=Record-fiend.blogspot.com|accessdate=November 3, 2010}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of country blues musicians]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.google.co.uk/images?hl=en&q=%22LOTTIE+KIMBROUGH%22&rlz=1R2RNTN_enGB358&um=1&ie=UTF-8&source=univ&ei=obXRTNmkLJS7jAfSn5mVDA&sa=X&oi=image_result_group&ct=title&resnum=6&ved=0CDgQsAQwBQ Images at Google.co.uk] - note several of the photographic images shown are not of Kimbrough.\n*[http://www.wolfrec.com/wolf-artists/country-blues-women-vol-i.html Wolf Records - ''Country Blues Women - Vol. I'']\n\n{{Persondata <!-- Metadata: see [[Wikipedia:Persondata]]. -->\n| NAME              = Kimbrough, Lottie\n| ALTERNATIVE NAMES = Beaman, Lottie; et al\n| SHORT DESCRIPTION = [[United States|American]] [[country blues]] singer]\n| DATE OF BIRTH     = 1900\n| PLACE OF BIRTH    = [[West Bottoms]], [[Kansas City, Missouri]], United States\n| DATE OF DEATH     = Unknown\n| PLACE OF DEATH    =\n}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Kimbrough, Lottie}}\n[[Category:1900 births]]\n[[Category:Year of death missing]]\n[[Category:Musicians from Kansas City, Missouri]]\n[[Category:Place of death missing]]\n[[Category:American blues singers]]\n[[Category:American female singers]]\n[[Category:Songwriters from Missouri]]\n[[Category:Country blues musicians]]\n[[Category:Gennett recording artists]]"}]}}}}
