He was the first African-American to conduct a major American symphony orchestra, the first to have a symphony (his first symphony) performed by a leading orchestra, the first to have an opera performed by a major opera company, and the first to have an opera performed on national television.  He is often referred to as \"the Dean\" of African-American composers.\n\n==Life==\nWilliam Grant Still was born in [[Woodville, Mississippi]]. He was the son of two teachers, Carrie Lena Fambro Still (1872\u20131927) and William Grant Still (1871\u20131895). His father was a partner in a grocery store and performed as a local bandleader. His father William Grant Still Sr. died when his infant son was 3 months old.  \n\nStill's mother moved with him to [[Little Rock, Arkansas]], where she taught high school English for 33 years.  She met and married Charles B. Shepperson, who nurtured his stepson William's musical interests by taking him to operettas and buying [[RCA Red Seal Records|Red Seal]] recordings of classical music, which the boy greatly enjoyed. The two attended a number of performances by musicians on tour. \n\nStill grew up in Little Rock, and started [[violin]] lessons at age 15. He taught himself to play the [[clarinet]], [[saxophone]], [[oboe]], [[double bass]], [[cello]] and [[viola]], and showed a great interest in music. His maternal grandmother sang African-American [[spirituals]] to him.  At age 16 he graduated from M. W. Gibbs High School in Little Rock.  \n \nHis mother wanted him to go to medical school, so Still pursued a Bachelor of Science          degree program at [[Wilberforce University]], a [[historically black college]] in Ohio. Still became a member of [[Kappa Alpha Psi]] fraternity. He conducted the university band, learned to play various instruments, and started to compose and to do orchestrations. \n\nStill was awarded scholarships to study at the [[Oberlin Conservatory of Music]] with Friedrick Lehmann and with [[George Whitefield Chadwick]]. He also studied with the modern composer [[Edgard Var\u00e8se]].\n\n==Career==\nIn 1918, Still joined the United States Navy to serve in World War I. Between 1919 and 1921, Still worked as an arranger for [[W.C. Handy]]'s band and later played in the pit orchestra for [[Noble Sissle]] and [[Eubie Blake]]'s musical, ''[[Shuffle Along]].'' Later in the twenties, he served as the arranger of ''Yamekraw'', a \"Negro Rhapsody\" composed by the noted Harlem Stride pianist, [[James P. Johnson]].\n\nIn the 1930s Still worked as an arranger of popular music, writing for [[Willard Robison]]'s ''Deep River Hour'', and [[Paul Whiteman]]'s ''Old Gold Show'', both popular [[NBC Radio]] broadcasts. In 1936, Still conducted the [[Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra]] as the first African American to conduct a major American orchestra.  \n\nIn 1934, Still received his first Guggenheim Fellowship; he started work on the first of his eight operas, ''Blue Steel''. In 1949 his [[opera]] ''Troubled Island'', originally completed in 1939, about [[Jean Jacques Dessalines]] and [[Haiti]], was performed by the [[New York City Opera]]. It was the first opera by an African American to be performed by a major company. \n\nStill moved to [[Los Angeles, California]] in the 1930s, where he arranged music for films. These included ''[[Pennies from Heaven (1936 film)|Pennies from Heaven]]'' (the 1936 film starring [[Bing Crosby]] and [[Madge Evans]]) and ''[[Lost Horizon (1937)|Lost Horizon]]'' (the 1937 film starring [[Ronald Colman]], [[Jane Wyatt]] and [[Sam Jaffe (actor)|Sam Jaffe]]). For ''Lost Horizon'', he arranged the music of [[Dimitri Tiomkin]]. Still was also hired to arrange the music for the film ''[[Stormy Weather (1943 film)|Stormy Weather]]'', but left the assignment after a few weeks due to artistic disagreements.\n\nIn 1955 he conducted the New Orleans Philharmonic Orchestra and became the first African American to conduct a major orchestra in the [[US Southern States|Deep South]].  Still's works were performed internationally by the [[Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra]], the [[London Symphony Orchestra]], the [[Tokyo Philharmonic Orchestra]], and the [[BBC Orchestra]].  \n\nHe was the first African American to have an opera performed on national United States television when ''[[Bayou Legend]],'' completed in 1941, premiered on PBS in . Additionally, he was the recording manager of the Black Swan Phonograph Company.\n\n==Legacy and honors==\n*William Grant Still received two [[Guggenheim Fellowship]]s.\n*He was awarded honorary doctorates from [[Oberlin College]], Wilberforce University, [[Howard University]], [[Bates College]], the [[University of Arkansas]], [[Pepperdine University]], the New England Conservatory of Music, the [[Peabody Conservatory]] in [[Baltimore]], and the [[University of Southern California]].\n*He was posthumously awarded the 1982 [[Mississippi Institute of Arts and Letters]] award for music composition for his opera ''A Bayou Legend''.\n\n==Selected compositions==\n* ''From the Land of Dreams'' (1924, believed lost until 1997)\n* ''Levee Land'' (1925)\n* ''From the [[Black Belt Region|Black Belt]]'' (1926)\n* ''La Guiablese,'' ballet (1927)\n* ''Sahdji'', ballet (1930)\n* ''Africa'' (1930)\n* ''[[Symphony No. 1 \"Afro-American\"]]'' (1930)\n* ''A Deserted Plantation'' (1933)\n* ''Blue Steel'', opera (1934)\n* Symphony in G minor (1937)\n* ''Lenox Avenue'', for radio announcer, chorus, & orch.
