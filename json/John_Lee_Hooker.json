Hooker was born in [[Mississippi]], he was the son of a [[sharecropper]], and rose to prominence performing his own interpretation of what was originally a unique style of [[country blues]]. He developed a '[[talking blues]]' style that became his trademark. Though similar to the early Delta blues, his music was metrically free. John Lee Hooker could be said to embody his own genre of the blues, often incorporating the [[boogie-woogie]] piano style and a driving rhythm into his blues guitar playing and singing. His best known songs include ''[[Boogie Chillen']]'' (1948), ''I'm in the Mood'' (1951), and ''[[Boom Boom (John Lee Hooker song)|Boom Boom]]'' (1962)\u2014the first two reaching #1 on the [[List of number-one rhythm and blues hits (United States)|''Billboard'' R&B chart]].\n\n==Early life==\nThere is some debate as to the year of Hooker's birth<ref>1915, 1917, 1920, and 1923 have all been cited (Boogie Man, p. 22). 1917 is the one most commonly cited, though Hooker himself claimed, at times, 1920, which would have made him \"...the same age as the recorded blues.\" (p. 59)</ref><ref>In the 1920 federal census, series T625/Roll 895/page 235, in the city of Tutwiler, Tallahatchie County, Mississippi, Supervisor's District 2, Enumeration District 87, Sheet #29 A, line 25, enumerated February 3, 1920, John Hooker is one of nine children living with William and Minnie Hooker. John is listed as 7 years of age at his last birthday. If accurate \u2013 and if his birthday is August 22 as he claims - John Lee Hooker was born August 22, 1912. Most of his other known siblings (cited in ''Boogie Man'', p. 23) \u2013 Daniel, Minnie, Isaac, Archie, Alice, Sarah, Sam, and Mary \u2013 are included in the census record (along with their proper relative ages) as well as parents William and Minnie's relative ages, possibly giving greater credibility to the 1912 birthdate.</ref> in [[Coahoma County, Mississippi]],<ref name=\"palmer\" /> the youngest of the eleven children of William Hooker (1871&ndash;1923),<ref>According to ''Boogie Man'', pg. 24, \"In 1928, Will Hooker Sr. and Jr. made a profit of twenty-eight dollars\" from farming, making his death in 1923 impossible</ref> a [[sharecropper]] and Baptist preacher, and Minnie Ramsey (born 1875, date of death unknown);<ref>According to the 1920 federal census, series T625/Roll 895/page 235, in the city of Tutwiler, Tallahatchie County, Mississippi, Supervisor's District 2, Enumeration District 87, Sheet #29 A, lines 18-19, enumerated February 3, 1920, William and Minnie were 48 and 39 years of age, respectively. Given this information, Minnie's year of birth is ca. 1880, not 1875. Minnie was thought a \"decade or so younger\" than husband William (''Boogie Man'', p. 23), again giving further credibility to this census record as corroborative evidence concerning John Lee Hooker's origins.</ref> according to his official website, he was born on August 22, 1917.\n\nHooker and his siblings were [[Homeschooling|home-schooled]]. They were permitted to listen only to religious songs, with his earliest exposure being the [[spirituals]] sung in church. In 1921, his parents separated. The next year, his mother married William Moore, a blues singer who provided Hooker with his first introduction to the guitar (and whom John would later credit for his distinctive playing style).<ref>''Conversation with the Blues'' by Paul Oliver, p. 188<br>See also: ''Guitar Facts'' by Bennett Joe, Trevor Curwen, Cliff Douse, Joe Bennett, p. 76</ref> \nJohn's stepfather was his first outstanding blues influence. William Moore was a local blues guitarist who learned in Shreveport, Louisiana to play a droning, one-chord blues that was strikingly different from the [[Delta blues]] of the time.<ref name=\"palmer\">{{cite book|first=Robert|last=Palmer|year=1982|title=Deep Blues|edition= \n|publisher=Penguin Books|location=United States|pages=242\u2013243|isbn=0-14-006223-8}}</ref> Around 1923 his natural father died. At the age of 15, John Lee Hooker ran away from home, reportedly never seeing his mother or stepfather again.<ref>''Boogie Man'' p. 43.</ref>\n\nThroughout the 1930s, Hooker lived in [[Memphis, Tennessee]] where he worked on [[Beale Street]] at [[The New Daisy Theatre]] and occasionally performed at house parties.<ref name=\"palmer\"/> He worked in factories in various cities during World War II, drifting until he found himself in Detroit in 1948 working at Ford Motor Company. He felt right at home near the blues venues and saloons on Hastings Street, the heart of black entertainment on Detroit's east side. In a city noted for its pianists, guitar players were scarce. Performing in Detroit clubs, his popularity grew quickly and, seeking a louder instrument than his acoustic guitar, he bought his first electric guitar.<ref name=\"oliver\">{{cite book|first=Terry|last=Wogan|authorlink=|coauthors=|year=1984|title=Shoes Off the Record|edition=|publisher=Da Capo Press|location=New York|pages=116\u2013118|isbn=0-306-80321-6}}</ref>\n\n==Career==\n[[File:John Lee Hooker two.jpg|thumb|190px|right|Hooker playing Massey Hall, Toronto. Photo: Jean-Luc Ourlin]]\nHooker's recording career began in 1948 when his agent placed a demo, made by Hooker, with the [[Bihari brothers]], owners of the [[Modern Records]] label. The company initially released an up-tempo number, ''[[Boogie Chillen']]'', which became Hooker's first hit single.<ref name=\"palmer\" /> Though they were not songwriters, the Biharis often purchased or claimed co-authorship of songs that appeared on their labels, thus securing songwriting royalties for themselves, in addition to their own streams of income.\n\nSometimes these songs were older tunes that Hooker renamed, as with [[B.B. King]]'s ''Rock Me Baby'', anonymous jams ''B.B.'s Boogie'', or songs by employees (bandleader Vince Weaver). The Biharis used a number of pseudonyms for songwriting credits: Jules was credited as ''Jules Taub''; Joe as ''Joe Josea''; and Sam as ''Sam Ling''. One song by John Lee Hooker, ''Down Child'', is solely credited to ''Taub'', with Hooker receiving no credit. Another, ''Turn Over a New Leaf'' is credited to Hooker and Ling.\n\nIn 1949, Hooker was recorded performing in an informal setting for Detroit jazz enthusiasts. His repertoire included down-home and spiritual tunes that he would not record commercially.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://weeniecampbell.com/yabbse/index.php?topic=2505.msg18965#msg18965 |title=John Lee Hooker box sets starts with 1948 Detroit recordings |publisher=Weeniecampbell.com |date= |accessdate=2011-12-30}}</ref>\nThe recorded set has been made available in the album ''Jack O'Diamonds''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.amazon.com/Jack-ODiamonds/dp/B001LJYCGW |title=Jack O'Diamonds: John Lee Hooker: MP3 Downloads |publisher=Amazon.com |date= |accessdate=2011-12-30}}</ref>\n\nDespite being illiterate, Hooker was a prolific [[lyricist]]. In addition to adapting the occasionally traditional blues lyric (such as \"if I was chief of police, I would run her right out of town...\"), he freely invented many songs from scratch. Recording studios in the 1950s rarely paid black musicians more than a pittance, so Hooker would spend the night wandering from studio to studio, coming up with new songs or variations on his songs for each studio. Because of his recording contract, he would record these songs under obvious pseudonyms such as '''John Lee Booker''', notably for [[Chess Records]] and [[Chance Records]] in 1951/52,<ref name=\"soulful\">{{cite web|url=http://www.soulfulkindamusic.net/jlhooker.htm |title=Discography at |publisher=Soulfulkindamusic.net |date= |accessdate=2011-11-04}}</ref> as '''Johnny Lee''' for [[De Luxe Records]] in 1953/54<ref name=\"soulful\"/> as '''John Lee''', and even '''John Lee Cooker''',<ref>Liner notes to ''Alternative Boogie: Early Studio Recordings, 1948-1952''.</ref> or as '''Texas Slim''', '''Delta John''', '''Birmingham Sam and his Magic Guitar''', '''Johnny Williams''', or '''The Boogie Man'''.<ref>Leadbitter, M. and Slaven, N. (1987). Blues Records 1943-1970: a selective discography''. London: Record Information Services, pp. 579-595</ref>\n\nHis early solo songs were recorded under Bernie Besman. John Lee Hooker rarely played on a standard beat, changing tempo to fit the needs of the song. This often made it difficult to use backing musicians who were not accustomed to Hooker's musical vagaries. As a result, Besman would record Hooker, in addition to playing guitar and singing, stomping along with the music on a wooden pallet.<ref>''Boogie Man'' p. 121.</ref> For much of this time period he recorded and toured with [[Eddie Kirkland]], who was still performing until his death in a car accident in 2011. Later sessions for the [[Vee-Jay Records|VeeJay label]] in [[Chicago]] used studio musicians on most of his recordings, including [[Eddie Taylor]], who could handle his musical idiosyncrasies very well. His biggest UK hit, ''[[Boom Boom (John Lee Hooker song)|Boom Boom]]'', (originally released on VeeJay) was recorded with a [[horn section]].\n\n== Later life ==\n[[File:John Lee Hooker.jpg|thumb|190px|right|Toronto, August 20, 1978]]\n\nHe appeared and sang in the 1980 movie ''[[The Blues Brothers (film)|The Blues Brothers]]''. Due to Hooker's improvisational style, his performance was filmed and sound-recorded live at the scene at Chicago's [[Maxwell Street|Maxwell Street Market]], in contrast to the usual \"playback\" technique used in most film musicals.<ref>[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080455/trivia The Blues Brothers (1980) - Trivia<!-- Bot generated title -->].</ref> Hooker was also a direct influence in the look of [[John Belushi]]'s character Jake Blues.\n\nIn 1989, he joined with a number of musicians, including [[Carlos Santana]] and [[Bonnie Raitt]] to record the album ''[[The Healer (album)|The Healer]]'', for which he and Santana won a [[Grammy Award]]. Hooker recorded several songs with [[Van Morrison]], including ''Never Get Out of These Blues Alive'', ''[[The Healing Game (song)|The Healing Game]]'', and ''[[I Cover the Waterfront (song)|I Cover the Waterfront]]''. He also appeared on stage with Van Morrison several times, some of which was released on the live album ''[[A Night in San Francisco]]''. The same year he appeared as the title character on [[Pete Townshend]]'s ''[[The Iron Man: The Musical by Pete Townshend]]''.\n\nOn December 19, 1989, Hooker appeared with [[The Rolling Stones]] and [[Eric Clapton]] to perform ''Boogie Chillen''' in Atlantic City, N.J., as part of The Rolling Stones [[Steel Wheels/Urban Jungle Tour|''Steel Wheels'']] tour.  The show was broadcast live on cable television on a pay-per-view basis.\n\nHooker recorded over 100 albums. He lived the last years of his life in Long Beach, California.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aaregistry.org/historic_events/view/john-lee-hooker-boogie-blues |title=African American Registry article \"John Lee Hooker, Boogie with the Blues\" |publisher=Aaregistry.org |date=1920-08-17 |accessdate=2011-11-04}}</ref>  In 1997, he opened a nightclub in San Francisco's [[Fillmore West|Fillmore District]] called ''John Lee Hooker's Boom Boom Room'', after one of his hits.<ref name=DummiesArticle>[http://www.dummies.com/WileyCDA/DummiesArticle/id-1131.html ''Discovering the Blues of John Lee Hooker''] Adapted from: ''Blues [[For Dummies]]'', by Lonnie Brooks, Cub Koda, Wayne Baker Brooks, Dan Aykroyd, ISBN 0-7645-5080-2, August 1998.</ref>\n\n==Death==\nHooker fell ill just before a tour of Europe in 2001 and died in his sleep on June 21 at the age of 83, two months before his 84th birthday. He was interred at the [[Chapel of the Chimes (Oakland, California)|Chapel of the Chimes]] in Oakland, California.<ref> [http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&GRid=23296 John Lee Hooker] at [[Find a Grave]]</ref>\n\nHis last live in the studio recording on guitar and vocal was of a song he wrote with [[Pete Sears]] called ''Elizebeth'', featuring members of his ''Coast to Coast Blues Band'' with Sears on piano. It was recorded on January 14, 1998 at Bayview Studios in [[Richmond, California]]. The last song Hooker recorded before his death was ''Ali D'Oro'', a collaboration with the Italian soul singer [[Zucchero Fornaciari|Zucchero]], in which Hooker sang the chorus \"I lay down with an angel.\" He is survived by eight children, nineteen grandchildren, eighteen great-grandchildren, a nephew, and fiance Sidora Dazi. He has two children that followed in his footsteps, Zakiya Hooker and [[John Lee Hooker, Jr.]]\n\nAmong his many awards, Hooker has a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] and in 1991 he was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]]. Two of his songs, ''Boogie Chillen'' and ''[[Boom Boom (John Lee Hooker song)|Boom Boom]]'' were included in the list of [[The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll]]. ''Boogie Chillen'' was included as one of the [[Songs of the Century]]. He was also inducted in 1980 into the [[Blues Hall of Fame]]. In 2000, Hooker was awarded the [[Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award]].\n\n==Music and legacy==\nHooker's guitar playing is closely aligned with piano [[Boogie-woogie (music)|boogie-woogie]]. He would play the walking bass pattern with his thumb, stopping to emphasize the end of a line with a series of [[Trill (music)|trills]], done by rapid [[hammer-on]]s and [[pull-off]]s. The songs that most epitomize his early sound are ''Boogie Chillen'', about being 17 and wanting to go out to dance at the Boogie clubs, ''[[Baby, Please Don't Go]]'', a blues standard first recorded by [[Big Joe Williams]], and ''Tupelo Blues'',<ref>[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GOCAC8FCqE YouTube - John Lee Hooker - 'Tupelo' (1995)].</ref> a song about the flooding of [[Tupelo, Mississippi]] in April 1936.\n\nHe maintained a solo career, popular with [[blues]] and [[folk music]] fans of the early 1960s and crossed over to white audiences, giving an early opportunity to the young [[Bob Dylan]]. As he got older, he added more and more people to his band, changing his live show from simply Hooker with his guitar to a large band, with Hooker singing.\n\nHis vocal phrasing was less closely tied to specific bars than most blues singers. This casual, rambling style had been gradually diminishing with the onset of [[electric blues]] bands from Chicago but, even when not playing solo, Hooker retained it in his sound.\n\nThough Hooker lived in Detroit during most of his career, he is not associated with the Chicago-style blues prevalent in large northern cities, as much as he is with the southern rural blues styles, known as [[delta blues]], [[country blues]], [[folk blues]], or front porch blues.  His use of an electric guitar tied together the Delta blues with the emerging post-war electric blues.<ref>[http://www.rhino.com/RZine/StoryKeeper.lasso?StoryID=203 Rhino - John Lee Hooker (1917-2001) - Rzine #203<!-- Bot generated title -->].</ref>\n\nHis songs have been covered by [[Buddy Guy]], [[Cream (band)|Cream]], [[AC/DC]], [[ZZ Top]], [[Led Zeppelin]], [[Tom Jones (singer)|Tom Jones]], [[Bruce Springsteen]], [[Jimi Hendrix]], [[Eric Clapton]], [[Nick Cave & The Bad Seeds]], [[Van Morrison]], [[The Yardbirds]], [[The Animals]], [[The Doors]], [[The White Stripes]], [[MC5]], [[George Thorogood]], [[R.
