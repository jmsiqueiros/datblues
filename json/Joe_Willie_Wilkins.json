His father, Papa Frank Wilkins, was a local [[sharecropper]] and [[guitarist]], whose friend was the [[country blues]]man, [[Charlie Patton|Charley Patton]]. Young Wilkins learned to play guitar, [[harmonica]] and [[accordion]].  His early proficiency of the guitar, and slavish devotion to learning from [[Gramophone record|records]], earned him the [[nickname]] of \"Walking Seeburg\" ([[Seeburg Corporation]] being an early manufacturer of [[jukebox]]).<ref name=\"AMG\"/>\n\nBecoming a well-known musician in the [[Mississippi Delta]], by the early 1940s Wilkins took over from [[Robert Lockwood, Jr.]] in [[Sonny Boy Williamson II]]'s band. In 1941, Wilkins reloacted to [[Helena, Arkansas]], and joined both Williamson and Lockwood on [[KFFA (AM)|KFFA]] Radio's \"[[King Biscuit Time]]\".<ref name=\"NPS\"/><ref>{{cite book\n| first= Paul\n| last= Oliver\n| year= 1969\n| title= The Story of the Blues\n| edition= 2nd\n| publisher= Northeastern University Press \n| location= Massachusetts\n| isbn= 978-0712674928\n| page= 171}}</ref> Through the 1940s Wilkins broadcast regularly playing alongside Williamson, [[Willie Love]], [[Robert Nighthawk]], [[Elmore James]], [[Memphis Slim]], [[Houston Stackhouse]] and [[Howlin' Wolf]]. His guitar playing appeared on several [[sound recording and reproduction|recordings]] by Williamson, Love and [[Big Joe Williams]], for the latter of whom he played [[bass guitar|bass]].<ref name=\"AMG\"/>\n\nFor [[Muddy Waters]], Wilkins was noted as the first guitarist from the Delta who played single string guitar riffs without a slide.  Later on, Muddy Waters stated {{cquote|\"The man is great, the man is stone great. For blues, like I say, he's the best.\"}}<ref name=\"AMG\"/><ref name=\"NPS\"/>\n\nForming The Three Aces with [[Willie Nix]] and Love in 1950, he rejoined Williamson at [[KWEM Radio]], which led on to Wilkin's becoming part of the [[recording studio|studio]] band at [[Sun Records]]. He was also utilised by [[Trumpet Records]], and as a prominent sideman, Wilkins recorded with  Williamson, Love, Nix, [[Arthur Crudup|Arthur \"Big Boy\" Crudup]], [[Roosevelt Sykes]], [[Big Walter Horton]], [[Little Walter]], [[Mose Vinson]], [[Joe Hill Louis]], [[Elmore James]], and [[Floyd Jones]].<ref name=\"NPS\"/>\n\n[[Charley Booker]]'s final recording was as a guest with Wilkins at a 1973 blues festival at [[Notre Dame, Indiana|Notre Dame]] in [[South Bend, Indiana]].<ref name=\"O'Neal\">O'Neal, Jim (2003): \"Greenville, Mississippi\".

Adamo Records later issued a [[live album]] of some of his concert dates.<ref name=\"NPS\"/> \n\nHis working relationship and friendship with Houston Stackhouse endured over the years, with Stackhouse at one time living in the same premises as Wilkins and his wife. Wilkins and Stackhouse played at various blues [[music festival]]s, and were part of the traveling Memphis Blues Caravan.<ref name=\"Encyc\">{{cite web |url=http://www.encyclopediaofarkansas.net/encyclopedia/entry-detail.aspx?entryID=4329|title=Houston Stackhouse (1910&ndash;1980) |author=Harris, Jeff |publisher=Encyclopediaofarkansas.net |accessdate=August 27, 2010}}</ref> After undergoing a [[colostomy]] in the late 1970s, Wilkins still continued to perform.<ref name=\"AMG\">{{cite web |url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p138134|pure_url=yes}}|title=Joe Willie Wilkins |author=Chadbourne, Eugene |publisher=[[Allmusic]] |accessdate=August 27, 2010}}</ref>\n\nWilkins is buried near Memphis in the Galilee Memorial Gardens.<ref name=\"NPS\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/history/delta/blues/people/joewillie_wilkins.htm |title=Trail of the Hellhound: Joe Willie Wilkins |publisher=Nps.gov |date= |accessdate=2014-01-26}}</ref>\n\n==Confusion over dates==\nThere is some confusion over both the precise date of birth, and death, for Wilkins.
