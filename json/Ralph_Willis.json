He subsequently worked as a research officer and industrial advocate for the [[Australian Council of Trade Unions]] (ACTU). He and his wife Carol Willis (n\u00e9e Dawson) have three children, Sandra, Fiona and Evan.\n\nIn 1972, the year that the [[Gough Whitlam|Whitlam]] Labor government was elected, Willis was elected as a Labor member of the [[Australian House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] for the extremely safe Labor seat of [[Division of Gellibrand|Gellibrand]] in Melbourne's western suburbs. He was elected to the Opposition front bench after Labor's defeat in 1975, and was Shadow Minister for Industrial Relations, Economic Affairs and Treasury from 1976 to 1983. In January 1983, however, he was dropped from the position as shadow Treasurer by Labor leader [[Bill Hayden]], who decided that [[Paul Keating]] would be likely to put increased pressure on the government in the area of economic policy.<ref>Bill Hayden (1996), ''Hayden: An autobiography'', Angus & Robertson, Sydney.</ref>\n\nAs a former ACTU official, Willis was regarded as a protegee of the new Labor leader, [[Bob Hawke]] (a former ACTU President), who became Prime Minister in March 1983. Hawke, however, kept Keating in the Treasury portfolio and Willis became [[Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations (Australia)|Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations]]. In 1987, he lost part of his portfolio to [[John Dawkins]], who was appointed Minister for Employment, Education and Training, but Willis retained Industrial Relations. In 1988 he shifted to [[Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government (Australia)|Transport and Communications]], and in 1990 to [[Minister for Finance and Administration (Australia)|Finance]]. When Keating resigned as [[Treasurer of Australia|Treasurer]] in 1991, Willis was again passed over when Hawke gave the Treasury to [[John Kerin]]. But Kerin's period as Treasurer was troubled and in December 1991 Willis finally became Treasurer.\n\nWillis's first tenure in the Treasury was brief, however, because Hawke was deposed and succeeded as Prime Minister by Keating only three weeks later. Keating gave Treasury to his ally [[John Dawkins]] and Willis was again given Finance. Willis got a second chance when Dawkins, frustrated by Cabinet's rejection of his economic views, resigned suddenly in December 1993. Keating was reluctant to give Willis Treasury again, considering him a low-key Parliamentary performer, but accepted party opinion that Willis deserved the job. Willis served the last term of the Keating government as Treasurer.\n\nOne of Willis's final acts, a few days before the 1996 election, was to release (without consulting Keating) a letter purportedly written by the [[Premier of Victoria]], [[Jeff Kennett]], which suggested that a [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal]] government led by [[John Howard]] would cut grants to the states. Unfortunately for Willis, the letter was a forgery, allegedly foisted on Willis by Melbourne University Liberal Club students.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.crikey.com.au/2002/11/13/early-election-coverage-comments/ |title=Crikey.com |publisher=Crikey.com |date=2002-11-13 |accessdate=2012-05-06}}</ref> This successful ruse impacted somewhat upon the last week of Labor's campaign. After the election Willis retired to the backbench following Labor's defeat in 1996 and retired from Parliament prior to the 1998 election.\n\nAt the time of his retirement, Willis was the only Labor Member of Parliament from the period of the Whitlam government still serving. Had he not retired, he would have become [[Father of the Australian House of Representatives|Father of the House]] in the next parliament.\n\nSince retirement from parliament Willis has served on several boards of companies and charities (see below).\n\n==Honours==\nWillis was awarded the [[Centenary Medal]] in 2001 for long service to the Commonwealth Parliament, including as a minister and as Treasurer.<ref>{{cite web|title=Ralph Willis|url=http://www.itsanhonour.gov.au/honours/honour_roll/search.cfm?aus_award_id=1115141&search_type=quick&showInd=true|publisher=Australian Honours Database|accessdate=13 June 2011}}</ref> On 13 June 2011, he was named an [[Order of Australia|Officer of the Order of Australia]] for distinguished service to the Parliament of Australia, particularly in the areas of economic development and industrial relations, to the superannuation industry, and to the community.<ref>{{cite web|title=Ralph Willis AO|url=http://www.itsanhonour.gov.au/honours/honour_roll/search.cfm?aus_award_id=1144250&search_type=quick&showInd=true|publisher=Australian Honours Database|accessdate=13 June 2011}}</ref>\n\nOn 2 June 2009, Willis was conferred with the degree of Doctor of the University ''Honoris Causa'' from Victoria University for services to Australia and in particular the Western Suburbs of Melbourne.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vu.edu.au/media/media-releases/ralph-willis-awarded-honorary-degree-by-vu |title=Victoria University |publisher=Vu.edu.au |date=2009-06-02 |accessdate=2012-05-06}}</ref>\n\n==Post-parliamentary appointments==\n{{BLP unsourced section|date=June 2007}}\n* Chair of Western Health Board 1 July 2004\n* Chairman of the Construction and Building Industry Superannuation Fund (C+BUS).\n* Director of the Australian Super Developments.\n* Chair and Treasurer of the Mietta Foundation\n* Member of the Australian Council of Superannuation Investors.\n* Member of the United Nations Secretary-General\u2019s High Level Panel on Youth Employment\n* Chairperson of the Melbourne City Opera\n* Board Member of the Westgate Community Initiatives Group,\n* Board Member of the Stan Willis Trust.\n* Chairman of LeadWest -
