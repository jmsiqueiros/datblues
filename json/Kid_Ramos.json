After playing at the parties of friends and at local [[nightclub]]s in his teenage years, he turned fully professional when joining [[James Harman]]'s band in 1980. He stayed playing his guitar for Harman until 1988, when he briefly helped out with [[Roomful of Blues]].  However, at this point, Ramos took a break from music to raise a family, and worked as a water delivery man.<ref name=\"AMG\"/>\n\nIn 1994, Ramos joined forces with [[Lynwood Slim]] to form the Big Rhythm Combo.  Ramos' debut solo album, ''Two Hands One Heart'', was released the following year. Ramos had joined [[The Fabulous Thunderbirds]] in 1993, following an invitation from their singer, [[Kim Wilson]]. As well as regularly recording and appearing with them up to 2002, Ramos also continued to release his own albums, with ''Greasy Kid Stuff'' (2001) being his most recent.<ref name=\"AMG\"/>\n\nRamos appeared at the 2005 [[Edmonton's Labatt Blues Festival]], playing along with [[the Mannish Boys]]. He also formed the roots quartet, [[Los Fabulocos]], who released their debut album in 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://deltagrooveproductions.com/music/artists/losfabulocos/main.html |title=Los Fabulocos |publisher=Deltagrooveproductions.com |accessdate=2012-12-08}}</ref> \n\nIn 2009, Ramos backed [[Bobby Jones (singer)|Bobby Jones]] at the [[Notodden Blues Festival]].\n\nIn August 2012, Ramos was diagnosed with [[Ewing's sarcoma]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.blues.org|title=The Kid Ramos Bob Corritore Phoenix Blues Sessions|publisher=The Blues Foundation|accessdate=2012-12-08}}</ref> a rare form of cancer, and underwent chemotherapy treatment the following month.
