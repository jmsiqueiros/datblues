He bought blues recordings himself, intruiged by guitar players such as [[Robert Lockwood, Jr.]], [[Eddie Taylor]], and [[Jimmy Rogers]]. Having practised the [[drum]]s as a youngster, Zinn purchased his first guitar at the age of seventeen, and then witnessed [[Luther Tucker]] perform in [[concert]] with Rogers. Within twelve months, Tucker invited Zinn onstage and gave him some guitar playing advice.<ref name=\"AMG\"/> By the late 1980s, Zinn was playing in several [[San Francisco Bay Area|Bay Area]] bands, and had backed both Rogers and [[Snooky Pryor]].<ref name=\"Bad Daddy\"/> \n\nA spell in [[Mark Hummel]]'s backing band The Blues Survivors followed, and he later met [[Kim Wilson]] at the 1992 [[San Francisco Blues Festival]].
