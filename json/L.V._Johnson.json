Johnson''' (December 25, 1946 &ndash; November 22, 1994)<ref name=\"Dead\"/> was an [[United States|American]] [[Chicago blues]] and [[soul-blues]] [[guitarist]], [[singing|singer]] and [[songwriter]]. He is best known for his renditions of \"Don't Cha Mess With My Money, My Honey Or My Woman\"  and \"Recipe\".  He worked with [[The Soul Children]], [[The Bar-Kays]] and [[Johnnie Taylor]], plus his self penned songs were recorded by [[Tyrone Davis]], [[Bobby Bland]] and [[The Dells]].  He was the nephew of [[Elmore James]].<ref name=\"Dead\"/>\n\n==Biography==\nJohnson was born in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]], and learned his guitar playing from [[B.B. King]].<ref name=\"AMG\"/>\n\nJohnson was originally a [[session musician]] employed by [[Stax Records]], and he played on [[sound recording and reproduction|recordings]] by [[The Bar-Kays]], [[Johnnie Taylor]], and [[The Soul Children]]. His songs \"Are You Serious\" and \"True Love Is Hard to Find\" were both [[hit single]]s for [[Tyrone Davis]], while \"Country Love\" was recorded by [[Bobby Bland]]. [[The Dells]] reached the [[United States|US]] ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[record chart|charts]] with their version of Johnson's \"Give Your Baby a Standing Ovation\".<ref name=\"AMG\"/>\n\nJohnson's association with Tyrone Davis extended to him being Davis' accompanist, until Johnson embarked on a modest solo career in the early 1980s. He then recorded for ICA, Phono, and [[Ichiban Records]], although his style did not garner much commercial success. Up to his early death from  undisclosed causes, Johnson was also the part-owner of a steakhouse and [[nightclub]] in Chicago.<ref name=\"AMG\">{{cite web |url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p27783/biography|pure_url=yes}} |title=L.V.
