There is an ongoing discussion on the talk page -->\nTerry was born in [[Greensboro, GA]].<ref>Terry, Sonny (as told to Kent Cooper). ''The Harp Styles of Sonny Terry''. Oak Publications, 1975, p. 7. There are, however, other sources that refer to his place of birth as Greensboro, NC.</ref>  His father, a farmer, taught him to play basic [[blues harp]] as a youth. He sustained injuries to his eyes and went blind by the time he was 16, which prevented him from doing farm work himself,<ref name=\"amg\"/> and in order to earn a living Terry was forced to play music. He began playing in [[Shelby, North Carolina]]. After his father died, he began playing in the trio of [[Piedmont blues]]-style guitarist [[Blind Boy Fuller]]. When Fuller died in 1941, he established a long-standing musical relationship with [[Brownie McGhee]], and the pair recorded numerous songs together. The duo became well-known among white audiences, as they joined the growing folk movement of the 1950s and 1960s. This included collaborations with Styve Homnick, [[Woody Guthrie]] and [[Moses Asch]], producing [[Folkways Records]] (now Smithsonian/Folkways) classic recordings.\n\nIn 1938 Terry was invited to play at [[Carnegie Hall]] for the first ''[[From Spirituals to Swing]]'' [[concert]],<ref name=\"amg\"/> and later that year he recorded for the [[Library of Congress]]. In 1940 Terry recorded his first commercial sides. Some of his most famous works include \"Old Jabo\" a song about a man bitten by a snake and \"Lost John\" in this he demonstrates his amazing breath control .\n\nDespite their fame as \"pure\" folk artists, in the 1940s, Terry and McGhee fronted a [[jump blues]] combo with honking saxophone and rolling piano that was variously billed as Brownie McGhee and his Jook House Rockers or Sonny Terry and his Buckshot Five.\n\nTerry was also in the 1947 original cast of the Broadway musical comedy, ''[[Finian's Rainbow]]''.<ref name=\"russell\">{{cite book\n| first= Tony\n| last= Russell\n| year= 1997\n| title= The Blues: From Robert Johnson to Robert Cray\n| edition= \n| publisher= Carlton Books Limited \n| location= Dubai\n| pages= 62\u201363\n| isbn= 1-85868-255-X}}</ref> He also appeared in ''[[The Color Purple (film)|The Colour Purple]]'' directed by [[Steven Spielberg]]. With Brownie McGhee, he appeared in the 1979 [[Steve Martin]] comedy ''[[The Jerk]]''. Terry collaborated with [[Ry Cooder]] on \"Walkin' Away Blues\" as well as a cover of [[Robert Johnson (musician)|Robert Johnson]]'s \"[[Crossroad Blues]]\" for the 1986 film ''[[Crossroads (1986 film)|Crossroads]]''.\n\nTerry died from [[Death by natural causes|natural causes]] at [[Mineola, New York]], in March 1986, three days before ''Crossroads'' was released in theaters.<ref>[http://thedeadrockstarsclub.com/1980.html Thedeadrockstarsclub.com - accessed December 2009]</ref> He was inducted into the [[Blues Hall of Fame]] that same year.<ref name=\"amg\"/>\n\n== In popular culture==\n\nTerry's rendition of the traditional song \"Fox Chase\", was used by the experimental filmmaker [[Len Lye]] as the soundtrack for his short film, ''Color Cry'' (1952).  \"Old Lost John\" was used by [[Werner Herzog]] twice: at the conclusion of his 1977 feature film ''[[Stroszek]]'' and also during shooting scene in ''Bad Lieutenant. Port of Call: New Orleans'' (2009). More recently Terry's track \"Whoopin' The Blues\" was used for an EON Wind Farm brand commercial. It also appeared in the film ''[[24 Hour Party People]]'' (Winterbottom, 2002).\n\nSonny Terry's harmonica is sampled in the song \"Love is Eternal Sacred Light\" on [[Paul Simon]]'s album ''[[So Beautiful or So What]]''. \n\n== Discography ==\n* ''Sonny Terry's Washboard Band'' (Folkways, 1955)\n* ''Folk Songs of Sonny Terry and Brownie McGhee'' (Roulette, 1958)\n* ''Blues with Big Bill Broonzy, Sonny Terry and Brownie McGhee'' (Folkways, 1959)\n* ''Brownie McGhee, Sonny Terry'' At [[The Bunkhouse (Coffeehouse)|The Bunkhouse]] ([[Smash Records|Smash]], 1965)<ref>[{{Allmusic|class=album|id=r108740|pure_url=yes}} At The Bunkhouse]</ref>\n* ''Sonny's Story'' (Bluesville, 1960)\n* ''Sonny is King'' (Bluesville, 1960)\n* ''Sing & Play'' (Society, 1966)\n*''[[Sonny & Brownie]]'' (A&M Records, 1973)\n*''Robbin' The Grave'' (Blue Labor, 1974)\n* ''Whoopin' (feat.
