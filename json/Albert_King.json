King was [[wikt:posthumously|posthumously]] inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in May 2013.\n\n==Life and career==\nOne of the \"Three Kings of the Blues Guitar\" (along with [[B.B. King]] and [[Freddie King]]), Albert King stood {{height|ft=6|in=4}}, some reports say {{height|ft=6|in=7}} and weighed {{convert|250|lb}}<ref name=\"russell\">{{cite book\n| first= Tony\n| last= Russell\n| year= 1997\n| title= The Blues&nbsp;\u2013 From Robert Johnson to Robert Cray\n| edition= \n| publisher=Carlton Books Limited\n| location= Dubai\n| pages= 72\u201373\n| isbn= 1-85868-255-X}}</ref> and was known as \"The Velvet Bulldozer\". He was born '''Albert King Nelson''', on a cotton plantation in [[Indianola, Mississippi]]. During his childhood he would sing at a family [[gospel]] group at a church where his father played the guitar. One of 13 children, King grew up picking cotton on plantations near [[Forrest City, Arkansas]], where the family moved when he was eight.\n\nHe began his professional work as a musician with a group called In The Groove Boys in [[Osceola, Arkansas]].<ref name=\"russell\"/> Moving north to [[Gary, Indiana]] and later [[St. Louis, Missouri]], he briefly played drums for [[Jimmy Reed]]'s band and on several early Reed recordings.  Influenced by blues musicians [[Blind Lemon Jefferson]] and [[Lonnie Johnson (musician)|Lonnie Johnson]], the [[electric guitar]] became his signature instrument, his preference being the [[Gibson Flying V]] which he named \"Lucy\". King earned his nickname \"The Velvet [[Bulldozer]]\" during this period as he drove one of them and also worked as a mechanic to make a living.\n\nKing moved to [[Gary, Indiana]] in the early 1950s, then to [[Chicago]] in 1953 where he cut his first single for [[Parrot Records (blues label)|Parrot Records]], but it was only a minor regional success.<ref name=\"russell\"/> He then went back to St. Louis in 1956 and formed a new band. During this period, he settled on using the Flying V as his primary guitar.<ref name=\"russell\"/> He resumed recording in 1959 with his first minor hit, \"I'm a Lonely Man,\" written by [[Little Milton]], who was [[Bobbin]] Records [[A&R]] man, a fellow guitar hero, and responsible for King's signing with the label.\n\nIt was not until his 1961 release \"Don't Throw Your Love on Me So Strong\" that King had a major hit,<ref name=\"russell\"/> reaching number fourteen on the [[United States|U.S.]] ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' R&B chart. The song was included on his first album ''[[The Big Blues]]'', released in 1962. He next signed with jazz artist Leo Gooden's Coun-Tree label. King's reputation continued to grow in the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]], but a jealous Gooden dropped him from the label.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} By modern standards, ''The Big Blues'' feels completely generic with little of note except King's guitar, but in 1962 it was fresh and marked a new type of clean, sharp blues over the \"dirty\" sound that characterized the genre during the 50s.\n\nIn 1966, King moved to [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]], where he signed with the [[Stax Records|Stax]] [[record label]].<ref name=\"russell\"/> Produced by [[Al Jackson, Jr.]], King with [[Booker T. & the MGs]] recorded dozens of influential sides, such as \"[[Crosscut Saw (song)|Crosscut Saw]]\" and \"[[As The Years Go Passing By]]\".  In 1967 Stax released the album ''[[Born Under a Bad Sign]]'', which was not technically a studio album, but a collection of all the singles King recorded at Stax.<ref name=\"russell\"/> The [[Born Under a Bad Sign (song)|title track of that album]] (written by [[Booker T. Jones]] and [[William Bell (singer)|William Bell]]) became King's best-known song and has been covered by many artists (from British rock group [[Cream (band)|Cream]], [[Paul Rodgers]], Canadian guitarist [[Pat Travers]], American rock guitarist [[Jimi Hendrix]] to cartoon character [[Homer Simpson]]). The production of the songs was sparse, clean, and maintained a traditional blues sound while also sounding fresh and thoroughly contemporary. Almost as important as King himself was the \"menacing\" [[electric bass|bass]] of [[Donald Dunn]], which at some points approached an early [[Heavy metal music|metal]] feel. ''Born Under A Bad Sign'' propelled Albert King to mainstream popularity at the comparatively late age of 44 and was one of the last albums recorded by an artist whose career began before the rock-and-roll era to be truly innovative, predictive of future music trends, and influential on young musicians of the era.\n\nAnother landmark album followed with ''[[Live Wire/Blues Power]],'' from one of many dates King played at promoter [[Bill Graham (promoter)|Bill Graham]]'s [[The Fillmore|Fillmore Auditorium]]. The album influenced musicians [[Jimi Hendrix]], [[Eric Clapton]], [[Robbie Robertson]], [[Gary Moore]] and [[Stevie Ray Vaughan]].\n[[File:Albert King 1968.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Albert King playing at the [[Fillmore East]] in October 1968 with his Gibson Flying V guitar. Photo: Grant Gouldon]]\n\nIn 1969, King performed live with the [[St. Louis Symphony Orchestra]]. That same year, he released a follow-up album to ''Born On A Bad Sign'', ''Years Gone By''. During the early 1970s, he recorded an album ''Lovejoy'' with a group of white rock singers, an [[Elvis Presley]] tribute album, ''[[Blues for Elvis \u2013 King Does the King's Things|Albert King Does The King's Things]]'', and a cameo on an [[Albert Brooks]] comedy album ''A Star is Bought''. The above-mentioned album was a collection of Elvis's 1950s hits reworked and re-imagined in Albert King's musical sound, although critics felt the results of it were mixed. ''Lovejoy'' introduced no really new musical innovations over King's previous two Stax albums, although it notably includes a cover of the Rolling Stones' hit ''Honky Tonk Woman''.\n\nAccording to [[Bill Graham (musician)|Bill Graham]], \"Albert was one of the artists I used many times for various reasons. He wasn't just a good guitar player; he had a wonderful stage presence, he was very congenial and warm, he was relaxed on stage, and he related to the public. Also he never became a [[Shuckin' and jivin'|shuck-and-jiver]]. One of the things that happened in the '60s&nbsp;\u2013 it's not a very nice thing to say, but it happens to be true&nbsp;\u2013 was that blues musicians began to realize that white America would accept anything they did on stage. And so many of them became jive. But Albert remained a guy who just went on stage and said 'Let's play.'\"{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}\n\nOn June 6, 1970, King joined [[The Doors]] on stage at the [[Pacific Coliseum]] in [[Vancouver, Canada]]. He lent his distinctive guitar to blues cuts such as \u201cLittle Red Rooster,\u201d \u201cMoney,\u201d \u201cRock Me\u201d and \u201cWho Do You Love.\u201d{Released on Rhino records as 'The Doors Live in Vancouver 1970' in 2010}\n\nLike many older artists, King wanted to remain relevant and on the charts, and so he eagerly embraced the new sound of [[funk]]. King was teamed with members of [[The Bar-Kays]] and [[The Isaac Hayes Movement (album)|The Movement]] ([[Isaac Hayes]]'s backing group), including bassist [[James Alexander (musician)|James Alexander]] and drummer [[Willie Hall (drummer)|Willie Hall]] adding strong funk elements to his music. Adding strings and multiple rhythm guitarists, producers [[Allen Jones (record producer)|Allen Jones]] and Henry Bush created a wall of sound that contrasted with the sparse, punchy records King made with Booker T. & the MGs. Among these was another of King's [[signature song|signature tune]]s \"I'll Play the Blues For You\" in 1972. The new instrumental arrangements added a renewed freshness to King's guitar licks; in addition it worked well for The Bar-Kays since funk was still a young genre and most such groups had yet to work with a competent guitarist.\n\n[[File:Albert King 1978.jpg|right|thumb|Albert King in 1978]]\n\nAfter ''I'll Play The Blues For You'', King recorded another album with the Bar-Kays, ''I Wanna Get Funky'' (1974). The record skillfully mixed standard blues licks with the latest in hot funk (although a few traditional-style blues tracks were also included) and it is considered his last strong album.\n\nIn 1975, King's career took a turn downward when Stax Records filed for bankruptcy, after which he moved to the small Utopia label. His next two albums, ''Albert'' and ''Truckload Of Lovin''' (1976), devolved into generic '70s pop music and the third album with Utopia, ''King Albert'' (1977), while somewhat more subdued, still lacked any standout material and King's guitar took a backseat to the background instruments.\n\nThe last recording King did with Utopia was ''Live Blues'' in 1977, performed at the [[Montreux Jazz Festival]] in [[Switzerland]]. As the audience here were knowledgeable jazz and blues fans who disliked experimentation, he played it safe and conservative, although ''As The Years Go Passing By'' is noteworthy for his duet (and even dueling) with Irish guitarist [[Rory Gallagher]].\n\nIn 1978, King moved to a new label, Tomato Records, where he recorded the studio album ''New Orleans Heat''. The label paired him up with R&B producer [[Allen Toussaint]], who had been responsible for scores of '60s-'70s hits in that genre, but was a novice at working with blues artists. The album was a mix of new songs (including Toussaint's own \"Get Out Of My Life, Woman\") and rerecordings of old material such as \"Born Under A Bad Sign\". Keeping with Toussaint's quality standards, production values were high, but the backing instruments were uninspired (if competent).\n\nKing took a four-year break from recording after the disappointing results of his late '70s efforts. During this period, he fully re-embraced his roots as a blues artist and abandoned any arrangements except straight 12-bar guitar, bass, drums, and piano. In 1983, he finally cut a new live album with Fantasy Records, ''Crosscut Saw: Albert King In San Francisco''. By the early '80s, a blues revival movement was in effect, but one with strictly amateur musicians who performed in bars and clubs. The backing musicians on ''Crosscut Saw'' certainly fit that description, lacking anything like the talent needed to complement King properly.\n\nIn 1984, King recorded ''I'm In A Phone Booth, Baby'', which turned out to be his last studio album. The recording included a redo of \"Truckload Of Lovin'\" and two ancient [[Elmore James]] tunes, \"[[Dust My Broom]]\" and \"[[The Sky Is Crying (song)|The Sky Is Crying]]\". Fantasy Records tried to recreate the sparse instrumentals of King's Stax years and not drown him out.\n\nKing influenced others such as [[Mick Taylor]], [[Derek Trucks]], [[Warren Haynes]], [[Mike Bloomfield]] and [[Joe Walsh]] (the [[James Gang]] guitarist spoke at King's funeral). He also had an impact on contemporaries [[Albert Collins]] and [[Otis Rush]]. He was often cited by Stevie Ray Vaughan as having been his greatest influence. Clapton has said that his work on the 1967 [[Cream (band)|Cream]] [[hit record|hit]] \"[[Strange Brew (song)|Strange Brew]]\" and throughout the album ''[[Disraeli Gears]]'' was inspired by King.\n\nKing's health problems led him to consider retirement in the 1980s, but he continued regular tours and appearances at blues festivals, using a customized [[Greyhound Lines|Greyhound tour bus]] with \"I'll Play The Blues For You\" painted on the side.<ref name=\"russell\"/> Shortly before his death, he was planning an overseas tour.<ref name=\"russell\"/> His final album, ''Red House''&nbsp;\u2013 named after the Jimi Hendrix song&nbsp;\u2013 was recorded in 1992. The album was largely ignored because of bad production quality, and original copies of it are scarce.\n\nKing died on December 21, 1992, from a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] in his [[Memphis, Tennessee]] home. His final concert had been in [[Los Angeles]] two days earlier. He was given a funeral procession with the [[Memphis Horns]] playing \"[[When The Saints Go Marching In]]\" and buried in [[Edmondson, Arkansas]] near his childhood home. [[B.B. King]] eulogized him by stating: \"Albert wasn't my brother in blood, but he was my brother in blues.\"\n\nOn December 11, 2012, it was announced that King would be posthumously inducted into the 2013 [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]].<ref name=\"americanbluesscene.com\">[http://www.americanbluesscene.com/2012/12/albert-king-inducted-rock-roll-hall-fame/ americanbluesscene.com]</ref> [[Gary Clark Jr.]], [[John Mayer]], and [[Booker T Jones]] performed King's \"Born Under A Bad Sign\" at the induction ceremony.\n\nKing also has a star on the [[St. Louis Walk of Fame]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stlouiswalkoffame.org/inductees/?view=achievement|title=St. Louis Walk of Fame Inductees|last=St. Louis Walk of Fame|publisher=stlouiswalkoffame.org|accessdate=25 April 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Instruments==\n[[File:Albert King.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Photo of Albert King in Chicago, 1981.]]\n\nKing's first instrument was a [[diddley bow]]. Next, he built himself a [[cigar box guitar]], before buying a [[Guild Guitar Company|Guild]] acoustic. The instrument he is usually associated with is a 1958 Gibson Flying V. In 1974 he began using a Flying V built by Dan Erlewine, and after 1980 also one built by Bradley Prokopow.<ref name=gress/>\n\nKing was left-handed, but usually played right-handed guitars flipped over upside-down. He used a dropped [[Minor scale|minor tuning]], reportedly C\u266f-G\u266f-B-E-G\u266f-C\u266f. He never used the sixth string.<ref name=gress>{{cite news|last=Gress|first=Jesse|title=Ten things you gotta do to play like Albert King|accessdate=17 April 2011|newspaper=[[Guitar Player]]|date=May 2011}}</ref>\n\nFor amplification, King used a solid-state [[Acoustic Control Corporation|Acoustic]] amplifier, with a speaker cabinet with two 15\" speakers and a horn (\"which may or may not have been operative\"). Later in his career he also used a [[MXR Phase 90]].<ref name=gress/>\n\n==Discography==\n{{Main|Albert King discography}}\n\n===Studio albums===\n* ''[[The Big Blues]]'' (1962)\n* ''[[Born Under a Bad Sign]]'' (1967)\n* ''[[Years Gone By]]'' (1969)\n* ''[[Blues for Elvis - King Does the King's Things]]'' (1970)\n* ''[[Lovejoy (album)|Lovejoy]]'' (1971)\n* ''The Lost Session'' (1971, released in 1986)\n* ''[[I'll Play the Blues for You]]'' (1972)\n* ''[[I Wanna Get Funky]]'' (1974)\n* ''Albert'' (1976)\n* ''Truckload of Lovin''' (1976)\n* ''King Albert'' (1977)\n* ''[[The Blues Don't Change|The Pinch aka The Blues Don't Change]]'' (1977)\n* ''New Orleans Heat'' (1978)\n* ''Crosscut Saw: Albert King in San Francisco''  (1983)\n* ''I'm in a Phone Booth, Baby'' (1984)\n* ''Red House'' (1992)\n\n==DVD and videos==\n* 1995 ''Maintenance Shop Blues'' (VHS), Yazoo\n* 2001 ''Godfather Of The Blues: His Last European Tour'' DVD, P-Vine Records\n* 2004 ''Live In Sweden'', Image Entertainment\n* 2010 ''In Session...Albert King with Stevie Ray Vaughan'', Stax, Concord Music Group, Inc.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n*[[Rob Bowman (music writer)|Bowman, Rob]] (1997), ''Soulsville, U.S.A.: The Story of Stax Records'', Schirmer Books.
