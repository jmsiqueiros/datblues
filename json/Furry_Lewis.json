Lewis was one of the first of the old-time blues [[musicians]] of the 1920s to be brought out of retirement, and given a new lease of recording life, by the [[folk blues revival]] of the 1960s.\n\n==Life and career==\n'''Walter E. Lewis''' was born in [[Greenwood, Mississippi|Greenwood]], [[Mississippi]], [[United States]], but his family moved to Memphis when he was aged seven.<ref name=\"amg\"/> Lewis acquired the [[nickname]] \"Furry\" from childhood playmates.<ref name=\"trail\">[http://www.musicianguide.com/biographies/1608002408/Furry-Lewis.html Trail of the Hellhound: Delta Blues in the Lower Mississippi - Lewis biography - accessed January 2008]</ref> By 1908, he was playing [[solo (music)|solo]] for parties, in taverns, and on the street. He was also invited to play several dates with [[W. C. Handy]]'s [[Orchestra]].<ref name=\"trail\"/>\n\nHis travels exposed him to a wide variety of performers including [[Bessie Smith]], [[Blind Lemon Jefferson]], and [[Alger \"Texas\" Alexander]]. Like his contemporary [[Frank Stokes (musician)|Frank Stokes]], he tired of the road and took a permanent job in 1922. His position as a [[street sweeper]] for the City of Memphis, a job he would hold until his retirement in 1966, allowed him to remain active in the Memphis music scene.<ref name=\"trail\"/>\n\nIn 1927, Lewis cut his first [[gramophone record|records]] in [[Chicago]] for the [[Vocalion Records|Vocalion]] [[record label|label]]. A year later he recorded for the [[Victor Records|Victor]] label at the Memphis Auditorium in a session with the [[Memphis Jug Band]], [[Jim Jackson (musician)|Jim Jackson]], [[Frank Stokes (musician)|Frank Stokes]], and others. He again recorded for Vocalion in Memphis in 1929.<ref name=\"trail\"/> The tracks were mostly blues but included two-part versions of \"[[The Ballad of Casey Jones|Casey Jones]]\" and \"John Henry\". He sometimes [[fingerpick]]ed, sometimes played with a [[slide (guitar technique)|slide]].<ref name=\"russell\">{{cite book\n| first= Tony\n| last= Russell\n| year= 1997\n| title= The Blues: From Robert Johnson to Robert Cray\n| edition= \n| publisher= Carlton Books Limited \n| location= Dubai\n| pages= 134\u201335\n| isbn=  1-85868-255-X}}</ref> He recorded many successful records in the late 1920s including \"Kassie Jones\", \"[[Stagger Lee (song)|Billy Lyons & Stack-O-Lee]]\" and \"Judge Harsh Blues\" (later called \"Good Morning Judge\").\n\nIn 1969, Lewis was recorded by the [[record producer]], [[Terry Manning]], at home in Lewis' Fourth Street apartment near [[Beale Street]]. These [[sound recording and reproduction|recordings]] were released in [[Europe]] at the time by [[Barclay Records]], and then again in the early 1990s by Lucky Seven Records in the [[United States]], and again in 2006 by [[Universal Records|Universal]]. [[Joni Mitchell]]'s song, \"Furry Sings the Blues\", (on her ''[[Hejira (album)|Hejira]]'' [[album]]) is about her visit to Furry Lewis' apartment and a mostly ruined [[Beale Street]] on February 5, 1976.
