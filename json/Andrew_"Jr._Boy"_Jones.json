Jones learned to play the guitar at a young age, and he joined [[Freddie King]]'s backing band, the Thunderbirds, at the age of seventeen and toured with them for a couple of years. In 1967, Jones became part of [[Bobby Patterson (musician)|Bobby Patterson]]'s backing band, the Mustangs,<ref name=\"AMG\"/> playing on a number of Patterson's [[Single (music)|single]] releases. By the early 1970s, Jones had regular work in Dallas backing many musicians, plus he was tutored further in his guitar playing by [[Cornell Dupree]].<ref name=\"Art\"/>\n\nIn 1973, Jones re-joined King's backing ensemble, and played with him until King died in 1976.  The latter part of the decade saw Jones create a [[Soul music|soul]] group known as the Creators, who signed a [[recording contract]] with [[RCA Records]]. Penned by Jones, their 1979 single, \"Blame It on Me\", was more successful on the [[Northern soul]] circuit in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] than in his home country. He worked locally in the early 1980s, primarily backing R.L. Griffin and Hal Harris, before finding regular work with [[Johnnie Taylor]] until 1985.<ref name=\"Art\"/> In late 1987, he went to [[California]] joining [[Bobby Bland]]'s drummer, Tony Coleman, and [[B.B. King]]'s bassist, Russell Jackson, and played as the Silent Partners,<ref name=\"Search\">{{cite web|url=http://www.bluessearchengine.com/bluesartists/j/andrewjrboyjones.html|title=Andrew \"Jr. Boy\" Jones; \"My grandmother gave me that nickname\"|publisher=Bluessearchengine|accessdate=2012-09-20}}</ref> who backed [[Katie Webster]] both in concert and on her ''Swamp Boogie Queen'' (1988) album.<ref name=\"AMG\"/>  The trio became [[session musician]]s working with [[Charlie Musselwhite]], with whom Jones remained until 1996.  Jones toured the world in this period, and played on three Musselwhite albums; ''Ace of Harps'' (1990), ''Signature'' (1991), and ''In My Time'' (1993).<ref name=\"Art\"/>\n\nIn 1997, Jones issued his debut solo album, ''I Need Time'', via [[JSP Records]].  This was followed the year after by ''Watch What You Say'' ([[Rounder Records]]), although that [[Record label|label]] association soon finished.  However, following ''Watch What You Say'''s release, Jones was nominated for a Blues Music Award for 'Best New Blues Artist'.  A [[live album]], ''Jr. Boy Live'' was released in 2006 and ''Gettin' Real'', his most recent release appeared on the [[independent record label]], Electro-Fi Records in 2009.<ref name=\"AMG\"/>\n\nHe recently opined his frustration of not being more widely recognised. \"I\u2019d have to say that I\u2019ve been close to certain things all my life. Been right there [where the action was]. Maybe, there have been some bad decisions on my part. Maybe, I haven\u2019t sucked up enough or to the right people.\"<ref name=\"Art\"/>\n\n==Discography==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!
