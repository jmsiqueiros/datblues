Pettigrew''' in [[Birmingham, Alabama]], [[United States]].<ref name=\"Review\"/> The first part of her eventual [[stage name]] came from a derivation of her childhood [[nickname]], 'Cutie'. She began work in 1900 in [[Atlanta, Georgia]], appearing in vaudeville, and the following year toured [[South Africa]] and across Europe with Mayme Remington's Pickaninnies. She was sometimes billed as Patsy Hunter. In 1913, she married the singer, Isiah I. Grant, and they worked on stage together before his death in 1920.  She married [[Wesley Wilson]] the same year,<ref name=\"Review\"/> but he surpassed her on stage names being later variously billed as Catjuice Charlie (in a brief duo with Pigmeat Pete), Kid Wilson, Jenkins, Socks, and Sox Wilson. He played both piano and organ, whilst Coot Grant strummed guitar as well as sing and dance.<ref name=\"AMG\">{{cite web |url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p289584|pure_url=yes}}|title=Coot Grant|author=Eugene Chadbourne |publisher=[[Allmusic]] |accessdate=October 10, 2011}}</ref>  \n\nThe duo's billing also varied between Grant and Wilson, Kid and Coot, and Hunter and Jenkins, as they went on to appear and later record with [[Fletcher Henderson]], [[Mezz Mezzrow]], [[Sidney Bechet]], and [[Louis Armstrong]]. Their variety was such that they performed separately and together in vaudeville, musical comedies, revues and traveling shows. This ability to adapt also saw them appear in the 1933 [[film]], ''[[The Emperor Jones (1933 film)|The Emperor Jones]]'', alongside [[Paul Robeson]].<ref name=\"AMG\"/>\n\nIn addition to this, the twosome wrote in excess of 400 songs over their working lifetime.<ref name=\"Fuqua\">{{cite book\n| first= C.S.\n| last= Fuqua\n| year= 2011\n| title= Alabama Musicians: Musical Heritage from the Heart of Dixie\n| edition= 1st\n| publisher= The History Press \n| location= Charleston, South Carolina\n| isbn= 978-1-60949-157-4\n| page= 151}}</ref>  That list included \"Gimme a Pigfoot (And a Bottle of Beer)\" ([[1933 in music|1933]]) and \"Take Me for a Buggy Ride\", which were both made famous by [[Bessie Smith]]'s recording of the songs, plus \"Find Me at the Greasy Spoon\" and \"Prince of Wails\" for Fletcher Henderson.
