Walker's parents, Movelia Jimerson and Rance Walker, were both musicians. His stepfather, Marco Washington, taught him to play the guitar, [[ukulele]], [[banjo]], [[violin]], [[mandolin]], and piano.<ref name=\"allaboutjazz\"/>\n\nWalker began his career as a teenager in [[Dallas]] in the early 1900s. His mother and stepfather (a member of the Dallas String Band) were musicians, and family friend [[Blind Lemon Jefferson]] sometimes came over for dinner.<ref name=\"russell\"/> Walker left school at the age of 10, and by 15<ref name=\"RS greatest guitarists\"/> he was a professional performer on the blues circuit. Initially, he was Jefferson's prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and would guide him around town for his [[Gig (musical performance)|gig]]s. <ref name=\"allaboutjazz\"/> In 1929, Walker made his recording debut with [[Columbia Records]] billed as '''Oak Cliff T-Bone''', releasing the single \"Wichita Falls Blues\"/\"Trinity River Blues\". [[Oak Cliff]] was the community he lived in at the time and T-Bone a corruption of his middle name. Pianist Douglas Fernell played accompaniment on the record.<ref name=\"AMG\"/> \n\nWalker married Vida Lee in 1935; the couple had three children.

Walker's only record in the next five years was ''T-Bone Blues'', recorded over three widely separated sessions in 1955, 1956 and 1959, and finally released by [[Atlantic Records]] in 1960.\n\nBy the early 1960s, Walker's career had slowed down, in spite of a hyped appearance at the [[American Folk Blues Festival]] in 1962 with [[Memphis Slim]] and prolific writer and musician [[Willie Dixon]], among others.<ref name=\"AMG\"/> However, several critically acclaimed albums followed, such as ''I Want a Little Girl'' (recorded for [[Delmark Records]] in 1968). Walker recorded in his last years, from 1968 to 1975, for Robin Hemingway's Jitney Jane Songs [[Music publisher (popular music)|music publishing]] company, and he won a [[Grammy Award for Best Ethnic or Traditional Folk Recording]] in 1971 for ''Good Feelin\u2032'', while signed by [[Polydor Records]], produced by Hemingway,<ref name=\"allaboutjazz\"/> followed by another album produced by Hemingway: Walker's ''Fly Walker Airlines'', which was released in 1973.<ref>[{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p27828/discography|pure_url=yes}} Allmusic.com discography]</ref>\n\n[[File:T-Bone Walker 1972.jpg|thumb|right|T-Bone Walker at the American Folk Blues Festival in Hamburg, March 1972]]\n\nWalker's career began to wind down after he suffered a [[stroke]] in 1974.<ref name=\"AMG\"/> He died of [[Bronchopneumonia|bronchial pneumonia]] following another stroke in March 1975, at the age of 64.<ref name=\"AMG\"/><ref name=\"Blues\">[http://blues.about.com/od/artistprofile1/p/T-BoneWalker.htm Blues.about.com - accessed June 2009]</ref> Walker was interred in the [[Inglewood Park Cemetery]] in [[Inglewood, California]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&GRid=6037 |title=T-Bone 'Daddy of the Blues' Walker (1910 - 1975) - Find A Grave Memorial  |accessdate=18 May 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\nWalker was posthumously inducted into the [[Blues Hall of Fame]] in 1980,<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.blues.org/halloffame/inductees.php?YearId=25#ref=halloffame_inductees |title=The Blues Foundation : Past Hall of Fame Inductees |accessdate=18 May 2011}}</ref> and into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in [[List of Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductees|1987]].<ref name=\"Blues\"/><ref>{{cite web |url= http://rockhall.com/inductees/t-bone-walker/ |title=T-Bone Walker: inducted in 1987 &#124; The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum |accessdate=18 May 2011}}</ref>\n\n[[Chuck Berry]] named Walker and [[Louis Jordan]] as his main influences.<ref>[http://www.there1.com/browse_articles.php?action=view_record&idnum=115 Johnny Harper, \"T-Bone Walker: Blues Guitar Godfather], There1.com.
