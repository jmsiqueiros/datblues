He won a [[Grammy Award for Best Traditional Blues Album]] in 1983 for his album, ''Alright Again!''<ref>[http://www.grammys.com/GRAMMY_Awards/Winners/ Past Grammy Winners on Official Grammy Award website]</ref> He is regarded as one of the most influential exponents of [[blues fiddle]] and has had enormous influence in [[American fiddle]] circles.<ref>Blues Fiddle|Julie Libermnan|Mel Bay?|Citation verification needed</ref>\n\nBrown's two biggest musical influences were [[Louis Jordan]] and [[T-Bone Walker]].<ref name=\"Music\"/>\n\n==Career==\n\n===1940s and 1950s===\nBorn in [[Vinton, Louisiana]], Brown was raised in [[Orange, Texas]]. His professional musical career began in 1945, playing drums in [[San Antonio, Texas]].<ref name=\"russell\">{{cite book\n| first= Tony\n| last= Russell\n| year= 1997\n| title= The Blues&nbsp;\u2013 From Robert Johnson to Robert Cray\n| edition= \n| publisher=Carlton Books Limited\n| location= Dubai\n| pages= 95\u201396\n| isbn= 1-85868-255-X}}</ref> He was given the nickname \"Gatemouth\" by a high school teacher who said he had \"voice like a gate\".<ref name=\"amg\"/> His career was boosted while attending a 1947 concert by [[T-Bone Walker]] in [[Don Robey]]'s Bronze Peacock Houston nightclub.<ref name=\"amg\"/> When Walker became ill, Brown took up his guitar and quickly wrote and played \"Gatemouth Boogie,\" to the delight of the audience right on the spot.<ref name=\"Music\">{{cite book\n| first= Paul\n| last= Du Noyer\n| year= 2003\n| title= The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Music\n| edition= 1st\n| publisher= Flame Tree Publishing\n| location= Fulham, London\n| isbn= 1-904041-96-5\n| page= 164}}</ref>\n\nIn 1949 Robey founded [[Peacock Records]] in order to showcase Brown's virtuoso guitar work.<ref name=\"amg\"/> Brown's \"Mary Is Fine\"/\"My Time Is Expensive\" was a hit for Peacock in 1949.<ref name=\"Music\"/> A string of Peacock releases in the 1950s were less successful commercially, but were nonetheless pioneering musically. Particularly notable was the 1951 instrumental \"Okie Dokie Stomp\",<ref name=\"Music\"/> in which Brown solos continuously over a punchy horn section (other instrumentals from this period include \"Boogie Uproar\" and \"Gate Walks to Board\").<ref name=\"amg\"/>  Okie Dokie Stomp was also recorded by Cornell Dupree in the 1970s and he had success with it as well. As for his gutsy violin playing, Robey allowed him to record \"Just Before Dawn\", his final release on the Peacock label, in 1959.\n\n===1960s and 1970s===\nIn the 1960s Brown moved to [[Nashville, Tennessee]] to participate in a syndicated [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]] television show, and while he was there recorded several [[country music|country]] singles.<ref name=\"russell\"/> He struck up a friendship with [[Roy Clark]] and made several appearances on the television show ''[[Hee Haw]]''.<ref name=\"amg\"/> In 1966, Brown was the musical director for the [[house band]] on the short-lived television program, ''[[The !!!! Beat]]''.<ref name=\"Music\"/>\n\nHowever, in the early 1970s several countries in Europe had developed an appreciation for American [[Traditional music|roots music]], especially the [[Blues music|blues]], and Brown was a popular and well-respected artist there.<ref name=\"russell\"/> He toured Europe twelve times, beginning in 1971 and continuing throughout the 1970s. He also became an official ambassador for American music, and participated in several tours sponsored by the U.S. State Department, including an extensive tour of Eastern Africa. Brown appeared at the 1973 [[Montreux Jazz Festival]], where he jammed with American blues rock band [[Canned Heat]].<ref name=\"russell\"/> In 1974, he recorded as a sideman with the [[New Orleans]] pianist [[Professor Longhair]] on his album, ''Rock 'N' Roll Gumbo'' (originally a Blue Star Records release). He moved to New Orleans in the late 1970s. In 1979, through his manager at the time, Jim Halsey, Brown embarked on a 6-week, 44 concert tour of the Soviet Union. This was an historic event as it marked the first time the Soviet Union made a contract with a U.S. private citizen (Jim Halsey) as regards a musical tour. All previous tours were under the auspices of the U.S. State Department. To date, this was by far the most extensive tour an American band had taken in the USSR.\n\n===Later years===\nIn the 1980s, a series of releases on [[Rounder Records]] and [[Alligator Records]] revitalized his U.S. career,<ref name=\"russell\"/> and he toured extensively and internationally, usually playing between 250 and 300 shows a year. He won a [[Grammy Awards of 1982|Grammy]] in 1983 for the album ''Alright Again!'' and was nominated for five more. ''Alright Again!'' is credited with putting Brown back on the musical map. He also won 8 WC Handy Awards.\n''\nIn 1999 Brown was inducted into the [[Blues Hall of Fame]].<ref name=\"All About Jazz\">[http://www.allaboutjazz.com/php/musician.php?id=5345 Allaboutjazz.com website biography]</ref>\n\nIn his last few years, he maintained a full touring schedule, including Australia, New Zealand, South America, Africa and Eastern Europe. His final record \"Timeless\" was released in 2004.\n\nIn September 2004, Brown was diagnosed with [[lung cancer]]. Already suffering from [[emphysema]] and heart disease, he and his doctors decided to forgo treatment. This greatly affected his musical career.<ref name=\"All About Jazz\"/> Later his home in [[Slidell, Louisiana]] was destroyed by [[Hurricane Katrina]] in 2005, and he was evacuated to his childhood home town of [[Orange, Texas]], where he died on September 10, 2005 at the apartment of a niece, at the age of 81. Brown is buried in the Hollywood Cemetery in Orange, Texas. However, flooding caused by [[Hurricane Ike]] in September 2008 damaged his grave.<ref name=\"Burial Plot\">[http://www.orangeleader.com/homepage/images_sizedimage_259174549/resources_photoview Orangeleader.com]</ref> His grave has since been refurbished and through donations a very impressive headstone has been erected in his honor.\n\n==Discography==\n\n===Original albums===\n* 1972 ''The Blues Ain't Nothin' '' (Black and Blue)\n* 1973 ''Cold Storage'' (Black and Blue)\n* 1973 ''Sings Louis Jordan'' (Black and Blue)\n* 1973 ''Drifter Rides Again'' (Barclay)\n* 1974 ''Gate's on the Heat'' (Barclay)\n* 1974 ''Down South in Bayou Country'' (Barclay)\n* 1975 ''Bogalusa Boogie Man'' (Barclay)\n* 1976 ''Blackjack'' (Music Is Medicine)\n* 1977 ''Heatwave'' (with [[Lloyd Glenn]]) (Black and Blue)\n* 1979 ''Makin' Music'' (with [[Roy Clark]]) (One Way)\n* 1981 ''Alright Again!''
