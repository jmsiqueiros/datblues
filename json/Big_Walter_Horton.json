A quiet, unassuming and essentially shy man, Horton is remembered as one of the premier harmonica players in the history of blues.<ref name=\"AMG\"/> [[Willie Dixon]] once called Horton \"the best harmonica player I ever heard.\"<ref name=\"AMG\"/>\n\n==Biography==\nBorn '''Walter Horton''' in [[Horn Lake, Mississippi]], he was playing a harmonica by the time he was five years old.<ref name=\"AMG\"/> In his early teens, he lived in [[Memphis, Tennessee]] and claimed that his earliest recordings were done there in the late 1920s with the [[Memphis Jug Band]],<ref name=\"AMG\"/> although there is no documentation of it, and some blues researchers have stated that this story was most likely fabricated by Horton.  (He also claimed to have taught some harmonica to [[Little Walter]] and the original [[Sonny Boy Williamson I|Sonny Boy Williamson]], although these claims are unsubstantiated, and in the case of the older Williamson, somewhat suspect).\n\nAs with many of his peers, he spent much of his career existing on a meager income and living with constant discrimination in a segregated United States of America.  In the 1930s he played with various blues performers across the [[Mississippi delta]] region.  It is generally accepted that his first recordings were made in Memphis backing guitarist [[Little Buddy Doyle]] on Doyle's recordings for the [[Okeh Records|Okeh]] and [[Vocalion Records|Vocalion]] labels in 1939.<ref name=\"AMG\"/><ref>Note: According to Dixon and Godrich (\"Recording the Blues,\" p. 92), the ARC/Vocalion company files list Hammie Nixon as the harmonica player, not Horton.</ref> These recordings were in the acoustic duo format popularized by [[Sleepy John Estes]] with his harmonicist [[Hammie Nixon]], among others.  On these recordings, Horton's style is not yet fully realized, but there are clear hints of what is to come.  He eventually stopped playing the harp for a living due to poor health, and worked mainly outside of the music industry in the 1940s.<ref name=\"AMG\"/>  By the early 1950s, he was playing music again, and was among the first to record for [[Sam Phillips]] at [[Sun Records]] in Memphis, who would later record [[Elvis Presley]], [[Carl Perkins]], and [[Johnny Cash]]. The early Big Walter recordings from Sun include performances from a young [[Phineas Newborn, Jr.]] on piano, who later gained fame as a [[jazz]] pianist. His instrumental track recorded around this time, \"Easy\", was based on [[Ivory Joe Hunter]]'s \"[[I Almost Lost My Mind]]\".<ref name=\"russell\">{{cite book\n| first= Tony\n| last= Russell\n| year= 1997\n| title= The Blues - From [[Robert Johnson (musician)|Robert Johnson]] to [[Robert Cray]]\n| edition= \n| publisher=Carlton Books Limited \n| location= Dubai\n| pages= 118\u2013119\n| isbn= 1-85868-255-X}}</ref><ref name=\"discography\">{{cite web |url= http://www.filisko.com/assets/Walter%20Horton%20Discography.PDF|title= Walter Horton's Recordings|first= Joe|last= Filisko |date= December 9, 2009|work= |publisher= |format=  PDF|accessdate=January 16, 2010}}</ref>\n\nDuring the early 1950s he first appeared on the [[Chicago blues]] scene, where he frequently played with fellow Memphis and Delta musicians who had also moved north, including guitarists [[Eddie Taylor]] and [[Johnny Shines]].<ref name=\"AMG\"/>  When [[Junior Wells]] left the [[Muddy Waters]] band at the end of 1952, Horton replaced him for long enough to play on one session with Waters in January 1953.<ref name=\"AMG\"/>\n\nAlso known as \"Mumbles\" and \"Shakey\" because of his head motion while playing the harmonica, Horton was active on the Chicago blues scene during the 1960s as blues music gained popularity with white audiences.
