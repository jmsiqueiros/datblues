They founded a band with Cave as singer. Their repertoire consisted of proto-punk [[cover versions]] of songs by [[Lou Reed]], [[David Bowie]], [[Alice Cooper]], [[Roxy Music]] and [[Alex Harvey (musician)|Alex Harvey]], among others. Later, the line-up slimmed down to four members including Cave's friend [[Tracy Pew]] on bass. In 1977, after leaving school, they adopted the name The Boys Next Door and began playing predominantly original material. Guitarist and songwriter [[Rowland S. Howard]] joined the band in 1978, expanding to five members.\n\nFrom 1977 until their dissolution in 1983 (by which time they were known as The Birthday Party) the band explored various styles. They were a leader of Melbourne's post-punk scene in the late 1970s, playing hundreds of live shows in Australia before changing their name to The Birthday Party in 1980 and moving to London, then [[West Berlin]]. Cave's Australian girlfriend and muse [[Anita Lane]] accompanied them to London. The band were notorious for their provocative live performances which featured Cave shrieking, bellowing and throwing himself about the stage, backed up by harsh pounding rock music laced with guitar [[Audio feedback|feedback]]. Cave utilised [[old testament]] imagery with lyrics about sin, curses and damnation.<ref name=rey/> The lyrics were full of \"[[American gothic]] imagery\", talking about horror stories.<ref name=rey/> Cave grew to detest the \"[[gothic rock|gothic]]\" label; their single \"Release the Bats\" (1981), described by Harvey as a \"comedic interlude\", was intended as a sardonic parody of the scene, however it became highly influential in the genre and \"a mantra for Goths everywhere\".<ref name=rey/><ref name=lew/><ref>Hanson, Amy.
