In 1991, he recorded his debut solo [[album]], ''Blues & Derivados'', which received positive reviews in Brazilian media. In 1992, he recorded his second solo album, ''Long Distance Blues'' for Movieplay Records. In this album Mindelis was joined by [[Larry McCray]], and the [[French people|French]] harmonica player, J.J. Milteau. As part of his promotional tour for the album, Mindelis played at a blues [[music festival|festival]] in [[S\u00e3o Paulo]], featuring [[Robert Cray]], [[Otis Clay]], [[Ronnie Earl]], [[Lonnie Brooks]] and [[Bo Diddley]].\n\nIn 1994, ''[[Guitar Player]]'' magazine profiled Mindelis. In the article, Jas Obrecht (the editor at the time) compared Mindelis to [[Jimmy Page]].

In 1995, Mindelis played at [[Clifford Antone|Antone's]] 20th Anniversary in [[Austin, Texas]], opening for Guy Forsite and [[Junior Wells]] others. [[Clarence \"Gatemouth\" Brown]] and Storyville also performed at the event.\n\nLater that year, Mindelis recorded his album ''Texas Bound'', featuring Tommy Shannon and Chris Layton, of [[Stevie Ray Vaughan]]'s rhythm section, Double Trouble. ''Texas Bound'' was the 12th best selling album seller in [[Benelux]].\n\nIn 1999, Mindelis released ''Blues On The Outside''. Mindelis appeared at the 25th edition of the [[Montreal International Jazz Festival]] in 2001, and did other presentations in [[Quebec]], [[Ottawa]]. Mindelis played at the festival again in 2004, after the release of his album ''Twelve Hours'', and again played Quebec and Ottawa, and also the Montremblant Blues Festival, sharing the stages with [[Keb' Mo']] and [[Jimmie Vaughan]].
