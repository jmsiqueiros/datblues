He learned the piano before entering the [[United States Army]] in 1916. His overall sound during the 1920s combined elements of the blues, [[ragtime]], barrelhouse boogie, and [[Stride (music)|stride]]. The same decade saw Moore acquire his [[nickname]], based upon a whistle he made while playing the piano.<ref name=\"Tsha\"/>\n\n==Career==\nIn 1929, he made his debut [[sound recording and reproduction|recordings]] for [[Columbia Records]]. The [[Gramophone record|records]] he made did not sell in great quantities, and Moore did not record again until 1937, when he issued a few sides on [[Decca Records]].<ref name=\"AMG\"/>\n\nIt was 1951 before Moore recorded again with [[RPM Records (United States)|RPM Records]]/[[Kent Records|Kent]]. However, throughout the 1940s and 1950s, Moore performed in [[nightclub|clubs]] in Dallas and occasionally other parts of Texas. [[Arhoolie Records]] signed him to a [[recording contract]] in 1960, and those subsequent recordings saw him obtain nationwide recognition. Throughout the 1960s, Moore played at clubs and [[music festival|festivals]] in [[United States|America]], as well as a small number of festivals across [[Europe]].<ref name=\"AMG\"/> He toured with the [[American Folk Blues Festival]] in 1969, performing on the same bill as [[Earl Hooker]] and [[Magic Sam]].<ref name=\"Tsha\"/> The same year he recorded a session in [[Stuttgart]], [[Germany]], which led to the release of ''Alex Moore in Europe''.<ref name=\"Tsha\"/> He did not record again in either the 1970s or 1980s, yet continued to give live performances up to his death.<ref name=\"AMG\"/>\n\nHe remembered and sang again the blues he had recorded in the 1920s and 1930s, such as \"West Texas Woman\" and \"Blue Bloomer Blues\", with their touching and [[poetry|poetic]] [[lyrics]].<ref name=\"russell\"/>\n\nIn 1987, Moore was granted a [[National Heritage Fellowship]] by the [[National Endowment for the Arts]], becoming the first [[African American]] Texan to receive such an honor.<ref name=\"Tsha\"/>\n\nThe year before his death, he recorded ''Wiggle Tail,'' his final session for [[Rounder Records]]<ref name=\"AMG\"/>  On November 22, 1988, the state of Texas designated his birthday 'Alex Moore Day.'<ref name=\"Wirz\"/>\n\n==Personal==\nMoore died of a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] in January 1989 in Dallas, aged 89.<ref name=\"Dead\"/><ref name=\"Tsha\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fmobh |title=Texas State Historical Association (TSHA) : Moore, Alexander Herman |publisher=Tshaonline.org |date= |accessdate=2014-01-31}}</ref> He never married, but was survived by a son and daughter. He was interred at the Lincoln Memorial Cemetery in Dallas.<ref name=\"Tsha\"/>\n\n==Legacy==\n[[Music journalism|Music journalist]] Tony Russell wrote that \"Moore was so odd a performer that some newcomers to the blues have been uncertain whether to take him seriously. By the time he became moderately well-known on the international blues scene of the 1960s and 1970s; his always singular style had burgeoned into florid eccentricity, and he would reminisce tirelessly in a foggy half-shout about youthful high times in his hometown, over skipping blues and [[boogie-woogie]] [[piano]] patterns with occasional bursts of shrill [[whistling]].\"<ref name=\"russell\">{{cite book\n| first= Tony\n| last= Russell\n| year= 1997\n| title= The Blues: From Robert Johnson to Robert Cray\n| edition= \n| publisher= Carlton Books Limited \n| location= Dubai\n| pages= 147\u2013148\n| isbn= 1-85868-255-X}}</ref>\n\n==Selected discography==\n*''Wiggle Tail'' (1988)\n*''Whistlin' Alex Moore'' (1994)\n*''From North Dallas to the East Side'' (1994)\n*''Ice Pick Blues'' (1995)<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/whistlin-alex-moore-mn0000250454/discography |title=Whistlin' Alex Moore &#124; Discography |publisher=AllMusic |date=1989-01-20 |accessdate=2014-01-31}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.wirz.de/music/moorafrm.htm Illustrated discography]\n*[http://www.deadbluesguys.com/dbgtour/moore_alex.htm Grave headstone]\n*{{findagrave|14621513}}\n\n{{Authority control|VIAF=36120800}}\n\n{{Persondata <!-- Metadata: see [[Wikipedia:Persondata]]. -->\n| NAME              = Moore, Alexander Herman\n| ALTERNATIVE NAMES = Moore, Whistlin' Alex\n| SHORT DESCRIPTION = American blues pianist, singer and whistler\n| DATE OF BIRTH     = November 22, 1899\n| PLACE OF BIRTH    = Dallas, Texas, United States\n| DATE OF DEATH     = January 20, 1989\n| PLACE OF DEATH    = Dallas, Texas, United States\n}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Moore, Whistlin Alex}}\n[[Category:1899 births]]\n[[Category:1989 deaths]]\n[[Category:African-American pianists]]\n[[Category:American blues pianists]]\n[[Category:Songwriters from Texas]]\n[[Category:American blues singers]]\n[[Category:American blues musicians]]\n[[Category:Boogie-woogie pianists]]\n[[Category:Deaths from myocardial infarction]]\n[[Category:Musicians from Dallas, Texas]]\n[[Category:Texas blues musicians]]\n[[Category:Whistlers]]"}]}}}}
