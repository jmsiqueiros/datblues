Along with [[Buck Owens]], Haggard and his band [[The Strangers (American band)|The Strangers]] helped create the [[Bakersfield sound]], which is characterized by the unique twang of [[Fender Telecaster]] and the unique mix with the traditional country steel guitar sound, new vocal harmony styles in which the words are minimal, and a rough edge not heard on the more polished [[Nashville Sound]] recordings of the same era.\n\nBy the 1970s, Haggard was aligned with the growing [[outlaw country]] movement, and has continued to release successful albums through the 1990s and into the 2000s. In 1994, he was inducted into the [[Country Music Hall of Fame]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://countrymusichalloffame.org/full-list-of-inductees/view/merle-haggard |title=Full List of Inductees |publisher=Country Music Hall of Fame |date=April 6, 1937 |accessdate=April 16, 2013}}</ref> In 1997, he was inducted into the [[Oklahoma Music Hall of Fame]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.omhof.com/Inductees/tabid/56/ItemID/54/Default.aspx |title=Inductees |publisher=Omhof.com |date= |accessdate=April 16, 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nHaggard's parents, James Francis and Flossie Mae, moved to California from their home in [[Checotah, Oklahoma]], during the Great Depression, after their barn burned in 1934.{{sfn|Cusic, Don|2002|p=XVII}} They settled with their children, Lowell and Lillian, in an apartment in [[Bakersfield, California|Bakersfield]], while James Francis Haggard started working for the [[Santa Fe Railroad]]. A woman who owned a boxcar, which was placed in [[Oildale, California|Oildale]], a nearby town north of Bakersfield, asked Haggard's father about the possibility of converting it into a house. He reformed the boxcar, and soon after moved in, also purchasing the lot, where Merle Ronald Haggard was born on April 6, 1937.{{sfn|Witzel, Michael Karl; Young-Witzel, Gyvel|2007|p=[http://books.google.de/books?id=Oq80iaT38k4C&lpg=PA130&dq=lewell%20guitar%20merle&pg=PA130#v=onepage&q&f=false 130]}}{{sfn|Cusic, Don|2002|p=XVIII}} The property was eventually expanded by building a bathroom, a second bedroom, a kitchen and a breakfast nook in the adjacent lot.{{sfn|Witzel, Michael Karl; Young-Witzel, Gyvel|2007|p=[http://books.google.de/books?id=Oq80iaT38k4C&lpg=PA130&dq=lewell%20guitar%20merle&pg=PA130#v=onepage&q&f=false 130]}}\n\nHis father died of a brain hemorrhage in 1945,{{sfn|Cusic, Don|2002|p=XVIII}} an event that deeply affected Haggard during his childhood, and the rest of his life.

He returned to Bakersfield in 1951, and was again arrested for truancy and [[petty larceny]] and sent to a juvenile detention center. After another escape, he was sent to the [[Preston School of Industry]], a high-security installation. He was released 15 months later, but was sent back after beating a local boy during a burglary attempt. After his release, Haggard and Teague saw Lefty Frizzell in concert. After hearing Haggard sing along to his songs backstage, Frizzell refused to sing unless Haggard would be allowed to sing first. He sang songs that were well received by the audience. Due to the positive reception, Haggard decided to pursue a career in music. While working as a farmer or in oil fields, he played in nightclubs. He eventually landed a spot on the local television show ''Chuck Wagon'', in 1956.<ref name=\"CMT\"/>\n\nMarried and plagued by financial issues,<ref name=\"CMT\"/> he was arrested in 1957 shortly after he tried to rob a Bakersfield roadhouse.{{sfn|Kingsbury, Paul|2004|p=223}} He was sent to Bakersfield Jail,{{sfn|Cusic, Don|2002|p=XX}} and was later transferred after an escape attempt to [[San Quentin Prison]], on February 21, 1958.{{sfn|Cusic, Don|2002|p=XXI}} While in prison, Haggard discovered that his wife was expecting a child from another man, which pressed him psychologically. He was fired from a series of prison jobs, and planned to escape along with another inmate nicknamed \"Rabbit\". Haggard was convinced not to escape by fellow inmates.{{sfn|Hochman, Steve|p=462|1999}} Haggard started to run a gambling and brewing racket with his cellmate.

He said it was the loneliest he had ever felt. {{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}\n\nAccording to Rolling Stone, \"In 1972, then\u2013California governor Ronald Reagan expunged Haggard's criminal record, granting him a full pardon.\"\n\n(http://www.rollingstone.com/music/artists/merle-haggard/biography#ixzz2x1GnbJuI)\n\n==Country success==\n[[File:Merle Haggard Tally Records - Cropped.jpg|thumb|upright|Haggard depicted on a publicity portrait for Tally Records]]\nUpon his release, Haggard started digging ditches and wiring houses for his brother. Soon he was performing again, and later began recording with Tally Records. The Bakersfield Sound was developing in the area as a reaction against the over-produced [[honky tonk]] of the [[Nashville Sound]]. Haggard's first song was \"Skid Row\". In 1962, Haggard wound up performing at a [[Wynn Stewart]] show in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]] and heard Wynn's \"Sing a Sad Song\". He asked for permission to record it, and the resulting single was a national hit in 1964. The following year he had his first national top ten record with \"[[(My Friends Are Gonna Be) Strangers]]\", written by [[Liz Anderson]] (Mother of country singer [[Lynn Anderson]]) and his career was off and running. In 1966, Haggard recorded his first number-one song \"[[I'm a Lonesome Fugitive]]\", also written by Liz Anderson, which Haggard acknowledges in his autobiography remains his most popular number with audiences.\n\nIn 1968, Haggard's first tribute LP ''[[Same Train, A Different Time|Same Train, Different Time: A Tribute to Jimmie Rodgers]]'', was released to acclaim. \"[[Okie from Muskogee (song)|Okie From Muskogee]]\", 1969's apparent political statement, was, according to some Merle Haggard interviews decades later, actually written as a humorous character portrait. In one such interview, Haggard called the song a \"documentation of the uneducated that lived in America at the time.\"<ref>Phipps 2001</ref> However, he said later on the ''[[Bob Edwards Show]]'' that \"I wrote it when I recently got out of the joint. I knew what it was like to lose my freedom, and I was getting really mad at these protesters. They didn't know anything more about the war in Vietnam than I did. I thought how my dad, who was from Oklahoma, would have felt. I felt I knew how those boys fighting in Vietnam felt.\"\n\nLater, Alabama Gov. [[George Wallace]] asked Haggard for an endorsement, which Haggard declined. However, Haggard has expressed sympathy with the \"parochial\" way of life expressed in \"Okie\" and songs such as \"[[The Fightin' Side of Me]]\". After \"Okie\" was released, it was a hit.\n\nRegardless of exactly how they were intended, \"Okie From Muskogee\", \"The Fightin' Side of Me\", and \"I Wonder If They Think of Me\" were hailed as anthems of the so-called [[Silent Majority (Politics)|Silent Majority]] and presaged a trend in patriotic songs that would reappear years later with [[Charlie Daniels]]' \"In America\", [[Lee Greenwood]]'s \"[[God Bless the USA]]\", and others. In 1969 the [[Grateful Dead]] began performing Haggard's tune \"[[Mama Tried (song)|Mama Tried]]\", which appeared on their 1971 [[Grateful Dead (album)|eponymous live album]]. The song became a staple in their repertoire until the band's end in 1995. The Grateful Dead also performed Haggard's \"Sing Me Back Home\" numerous times between 1971 and 1973. In addition, [[The Flying Burrito Brothers]] recorded and performed \"White Line Fever\" in 1971, and toured with \"Sing Me Back Home\" and \"Hungry Eyes\". Singer-activist [[Joan Baez]], whose political leanings could not be more different from those expressed in Haggard's above-referenced songs, nonetheless covered \"Sing Me Back Home\" and \"Mama Tried\" in 1969. [[The Everly Brothers]] also used both songs in their 1968 country-rock album ''[[Roots (Everly Brothers album)|Roots]]''. Haggard's next LP was ''[[A Tribute to the Best Damn Fiddle Player in the World (or, My Salute to Bob Wills)|A Tribute to the Best Damn Fiddle Player in the World]]'', dedicated to [[Bob Wills]], which helped spark a permanent revival and expanded audience for [[western swing]].\n\n[[File:Merle Haggard 1975 - cropped.jpg|thumb|upright|Haggard in 1975]]\nOn Tuesday, March 14, 1972, shortly after \"[[Carolyn (song)|Carolyn]]\" became another number one country hit for Haggard, then-California governor [[Ronald Reagan]] granted Haggard a full [[pardon]] for his past crimes. During the early to mid-1970s, Haggard's chart domination continued with songs like \"Someday We'll Look Back\", \"Carolyn\", \"[[Grandma Harp]]\", \"[[Always Wanting You]]\", and \"[[The Roots of My Raising]]\". He also wrote and performed the theme song to the television series ''[[Movin' On (TV series)|Movin' On]]'', which in 1975 gave him another number one country hit. The 1973 [[recession]] anthem \"[[If We Make It Through December]]\" furthered Haggard's status as a champion of the working class. Haggard appeared on the cover of ''TIME'' on May 6, 1974.\n\nIn the fall of 1972, \"Let Me Tell You about A Song,\" the first TV special starring Merle Haggard, was nationally syndicated by Capital Cities TV Productions. It was a semi-autobiographical, musical profile of Haggard, akin to the contemporary \"Behind The Music,\" produced and directed by Michael Davis.\n\nIn 1981, Haggard published an autobiography, ''Sing Me Back Home''. That same year, he alternately spoke and sang the ballad \"The Man in the Mask\". Written by [[Dean Pitchford]] (whose other output includes \"[[Fame (Irene Cara song)|Fame]]\", \"[[Footloose (song)|Footloose]]\", \"[[Sing (1989 film)|Sing]]\", \"[[Solid Gold (TV series)|Solid Gold]]\", and the musical ''[[Carrie (musical)|Carrie]]''), this was the combined narration/theme from the movie ''[[The Legend of the Lone Ranger]]'', a box-office flop.\n\nCountry star [[Willie Nelson]] believed the 1983 [[Academy Award]]-winning film ''[[Tender Mercies]]'', about the life of fictional singer Mac Sledge, was based on the life of Merle Haggard. Actor [[Robert Duvall]] and other filmmakers denied this and claimed the character was based on nobody in particular. Duvall, however, said he was a big fan of Haggard.<ref>{{cite video|people=[[Robert Duvall]] (actor), Gary Hertz (director)|date=April 16, 2002|title= Miracles & Mercies|url= http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0383509/ |medium=Documentary|publisher=[[Blue Underground]] |location=[[West Hollywood]]|accessdate=January 28, 2008}}</ref>\n\n\"If We Make It Through December\" turned out to be Haggard's last pop hit. Although he won a [[Grammy Award for Best Male Country Vocal Performance]] for his 1984 remake of \"[[That's the Way Love Goes (Johnny Rodriguez song)|That's The Way Love Goes]]\", newer singers had begun to take over country music, and singers like [[George Strait]] and [[Randy Travis]] had taken over the charts. Haggard's last number one hit was \"[[Twinkle, Twinkle Lucky Star]]\" from his smash album ''Chill Factor'' in 1988.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}\n\nIn 1989, Haggard recorded a song, \"Me and Crippled Soldiers Give a Damn\", in response to the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]]'s decision to allow flag burning under the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]]. After CBS Records Nashville avoided releasing the song, Haggard bought his way out of the contract and signed with [[Curb Records]], which was willing to release the song. Of the situation, Haggard commented, \"I've never been a guy that can do what people told me...It's always been my nature to fight the system.\"<ref name=\"Traditional Values NYT\">{{cite news|last=Schoemer|first=Karen|title=Pop/Jazz; A Maverick Upholding Traditional Values|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1990/07/06/arts/pop-jazz-a-maverick-upholding-traditional-values.html?pagewanted=all&src=pm|accessdate=October 19, 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=July 6, 1990}}</ref>\n\n==Comeback==\n[[File:MerleHaggardJun09.jpg|thumb|Haggard performing in June 2009|upright]]\nIn 2000, Haggard made a comeback of sorts, signing with the independent record label Anti and releasing the spare ''If I Could Only Fly'' to critical acclaim. He followed it in 2001 with ''Roots, vol. 1'', a collection of [[Lefty Frizzell]], [[Hank Williams]], and [[Hank Thompson (musician)|Hank Thompson]] covers, along with three Haggard originals. The album, recorded in Haggard's living room with no overdubs, featured Haggard's longtime bandmates The Strangers as well as Frizzell's original lead guitarist, Norman Stephens. In December 2004, Haggard spoke at length on ''[[Larry King Live]]'' about his incarceration as a young man and said it was \"hell\" and \"the scariest experience of my life\".{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}\n\nHaggard's number one hit single \"Mama Tried\" is featured in the 2003 film ''[[Radio (2003 film)|Radio]]'' with [[Cuba Gooding, Jr.]] and [[Ed Harris]] as well as in Bryan Bertino's \"The Strangers\" with Liv Tyler. In addition, his song \"Swingin' Doors\" can be heard in the 2004 film ''[[Crash (2004 film)|Crash]]'' and his 1981 hit \"Big City\" is heard in Joel and Ethan Coen's 1996 film \"Fargo\" and in the 2008 Larry Bishop film \"Hell Ride\".{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}\n\nIn October 2005, Haggard released his album ''[[Chicago Wind (Merle Haggard album)|Chicago Wind]]'' to mostly positive reviews. The album contained an anti-Iraq war song titled \"America First,\" in which he laments the nation's economy and faltering infrastructure, applauds its soldiers, and sings, \"Let's get out of Iraq, and get back on track.\" This follows from his 2003 release \"Haggard Like Never Before\" in which he includes a song, \"That's The News\".\nHaggard released a [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]] album, ''[[The Bluegrass Sessions (Merle Haggard album)|The Bluegrass Sessions]]'', on October 2, 2007. In 2008, Haggard was going to perform at Riverfest in [[Little Rock, Arkansas]], but the concert was canceled because he was ailing, and three other concerts were canceled as well; however, he was back on the road in June and successfully completed a tour that ended on October 19.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}\n\nIn April 2010, Haggard released a new album, ''[[I Am What I Am (Merle Haggard album)|I Am What I Am]]''.<ref>{{cite web|last=See|first=Elena|title=First Listen: Merle Haggard, 'I Am What I Am'|url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=125636724&sc=fb&cc=fp|publisher=www.npr.org|accessdate=July 22, 2010}}</ref> Released to strong reviews, Haggard performed the title song on ''[[The Tonight Show with Jay Leno]]'' in February 2011.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}\n\n==Equipment==\nHaggard has endorsed Fender guitars and has a Custom Artist signature model Telecaster.

He also plays six-string acoustic models. In 2001, C.F. Martin & Company introduced a limited edition Merle Haggard Signature Edition 000-28SMH acoustic guitar available with or without factory-installed electronics.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}\n\n==Personal life==\n\n===Wives and children===\n{{BLP unsourced section|date=March 2012}}\nHaggard has been married five times, first to Leona Hobbs from 1956 to 1964. They had four children: Dana, [[Marty Haggard|Marty]], Kelli, [[Noel Haggard|Noel]]. They divorced, and in 1965 he married singer [[Bonnie Owens]], former wife of Buck Owens, and a successful country singer at the time.  Haggard has credited her with helping him make his big break as a country artist.  Haggard shared the writing credit with Owens for his hit \"Today I Started Loving You Again\", and has acknowledged, including on stage, that the song was about a sudden burst of special feelings he experienced for her while they were touring together.  She also helped care for Haggard's children from his first wife and was the maid of honor for Haggard's third marriage. Haggard and Owens divorced in 1978. In 1978 Haggard married [[Leona Williams]]; they divorced in 1983. In 1985 Haggard married Debbie Parret, but they divorced in 1991.

[[The Youngbloods]] responded to \"Okie from Muskogee\" with \"Hippie from Olema\", in which, in one repetition of the chorus, they change the line \"We still take in strangers if they're ragged\" to \"We still take in strangers if they're haggard\". [[Nick Gravenites]], of [[Big Brother and the Holding Company]], paid Haggard a tongue-in-cheek tribute with the song, \"I'll Change Your Flat Tire, Merle,\" later covered by other artists including [[Pure Prairie League]]. [[The Dixie Chicks]] paid tribute by recording [[Darrell Scott]]'s song \"Long Time Gone\", which criticizes Nashville trends: \"We listen to the radio to hear what's cookin\u2019/But the music ain't got no soul/ Now they sound tired but they don\u2019t sound Haggard,\" with the following lines mentioning [[Johnny Cash]] and [[Hank Williams]] in the same vein. [[Collin Raye]] paid him tribute with the song \"My Kind of Girl\", when he sang \"How 'bout some music/She said have you got any Merle/That's when I knew she was my kind of girl.\" In 2000, Jackson and Strait sang \"Murder on Music Row,\" which criticizes mainstream country trends: \"The Hag wouldn't have a chance on today's radio/Because they committed murder down on music row.\" In 2005, the country rock duo [[Brooks & Dunn]] sang \"Just Another Neon Night\" off their Hillbilly Deluxe album. In the song [[Ronnie Dunn]] said \"He's got an Eastwood grin and a too early swagger/Hollerin' turn off that rap/And play me some Haggard\". Brooks & Dunn also reference Haggard in 1993's \"Rock My World (little country girl)\" off their Hard Workin' Man Album as they sing \"Acts like Madonna but she listens to Merle/Rock my world little country girl.\"  Red Simpson also mentions Merle and Buck Owens in his 1971 song \"Hello, I'm a Truck\".  The last line in the song goes, \"Well, I know what he's gonna do now/Take out that tape cartridge of Buck Owens and play it again/I dunno why he don't get a Merle Haggard Tape.\"\n[[File:MerleHaggardDrive.jpg|thumb|upright|Merle Haggard Drive, [[Oildale, California]]]]\nIn 2005, [[Shooter Jennings]] mentioned him in the title track of his album ''[[Put the \"O\" Back in Country]]'' and later mentioned him in 2007 in his song \"Concrete Cowboys.\" In 2006, [[Hank Williams III]] included Haggard as well as other country icons in the song \"Country Heroes\". [[Steve Goodman]] mentioned him, humorously but respectfully, in the song \"[[You Never Even Called Me by My Name]]\" (which he either co-wrote or did not co-write with [[John Prine]]). [[George Jones]] recorded two albums with him (Merle) and mentions \"The Okie from Muskogee\" in his song \"Who's Gonna Fill Their Shoes\". Lynyrd Skynyrd's song, \"[[Nuthin' Fancy|Railroad Song]]\", references Haggard, \"Well I'm a ride this train Lord until I find out/What [[Jimmie Rodgers (country singer)|Jimmie Rodgers]] and the Hag was all about\". They also performed both a cover of \"[[Merle Haggard Presents His 30th Album|Honky Tonk Night Time Man]]\" as well as their own take on the song with \"Jacksonville Kid\" (found on the 2001 CD reissue of the album) on the album, ''[[Street Survivors]]''.   {{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}\n\nIn 2006, Haggard was back on the charts in a duet with [[Gretchen Wilson]], \"Politically Uncorrect\".<ref>[http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000AA3052 Duet with Gretchen Wilson]</ref> He is also featured on \"Pledge Allegiance to the Hag\" on [[Eric Church]]'s debut album.\n\nOn June 14, 2013, Merle Haggard was presented an honorary doctorate by California State University, Bakersfield. The doctor of fine arts honor, the first in CSUB's history, was conferred during School of Arts & Humanities commencement ceremonies.\n\nHaggard performed his 1968 song [[Okie from Muskogee]] at the [[56th Annual Grammy Awards]] on January 26, 2014 with [[Willie Nelson]], [[Kris Kristofferson]], and [[Blake Shelton]].\n\nHaggard has also greatly influenced the Carolina-born, Texas-raised crooner [[D.T. Buffkin]] with his inclusion of jazz and rock 'n' roll elements into his music.\n\n==Discography==\n{{Main|Merle Haggard discography}}\n\n==Number one hits==\n<!--Hag' had 40 No.1 hit songs chart on
