Growing up surrounded by talent, he recalls a childhood conversation with [[Bob Dylan]], who, on the subject of guitar playing, advised the 11-year-old Bibb to \"Keep it simple, forget all that fancy stuff\" (as recounted in \"The Transatlantic Sessions 5\" program and DVD from the BBC).\n\nBibb remembers from his early teen years:<blockquote>I would cut school and claim I was sick. When everyone would leave the house I would whip out all the records and do my own personal DJ thing all day long, playing [[Odetta]], [[Joan Baez]], the [[New Lost City Ramblers]], [[Josh White]].<ref>[http://www.allaboutjazz.com/php/musician.php?id=4975 All About Jazz - Eric Bibb profile]</ref></blockquote>\n\nAt 16 years old, his father invited him to play guitar in the house band for his TV talent show \"Someone New\".  Bill Lee, who played bass in this band, was later to appear on Bibb's albums ''Me To You'' and ''Friends''. In 1969, Bibb played guitar for the Negro Ensemble Company at St. Mark's Place in New York. He went on to study Psychology and Russian at [[Columbia University]], but did not finish these studies. The next year, aged 19, he left for Paris, where he met guitarist [[Mickey Baker]] who focused his interest in [[blues]] guitar.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.npr.org/2011/05/24/136610075/eric-bibb-on-mountain-stage|title=Eric Bibb on Mountain Stage|date=24 May 2011|publisher=National Public Radio|accessdate=14 April 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.somdnews.com/article/20110722/ENTERTAINMENT/707229974/1068/eric-bibb-plays-worldly-blues&template=southernMaryland|title=Eric Bibb Plays Worldly Blues|author=Mercer, Dickson|date=22 July 2011|publisher=South Maryland News|accessdate=14 April 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/musicnightlife/2009413368_bibb03.html|title=Bluesman Eric Bibb Taps Into The Spiritual Power of Music|author=Gilbert, Andrew|date=3 July 2009|publisher=The Seattle Times|accessdate=14 April 2012}}</ref>\n\nBibb moved to [[Stockholm]], where he immersed himself in pre-war blues and the newly discovered [[world music]] scene, while he continued to write and perform.
