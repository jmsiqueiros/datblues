He was once a member of [[Howlin' Wolf]]'s backing band, and worked variously with [[Muddy Waters]], [[Jimmy Rogers]], [[Bo Diddley]], [[Ike Turner]], [[J. T. Brown (musician)|J. T. Brown]], [[Freddie King]], [[Little Johnny Jones (pianist)|Little Johnny Jones]], [[Little Walter]], and [[Willie Dixon]].<ref name=\"Mswriters\"/><ref name=\"Dead\"/>  His younger brother, Abe (born Albert, January 2, 1939), became known as the bluesman [[Little Smokey Smothers]], with whom he is sometimes confused.<ref name=\"Mswriters\"/>\n\n==Biography==\nSmothers was born in [[Lexington, Mississippi|Lexington]], [[Mississippi]], and was taught by his aunt to play both [[harmonica]] and [[guitar]].  Smothers relocated to Chicago in 1946, and his debut stage performance occurred with [[Johnny Williams (blues musician)|Johnny Williams]] and [[Johnny \"Man\" Young]].  In the early part of the 1950s, Smothers played alongside his own cousin [[Lester Davenport]], plus Arthur \"Big Boy\" Spires, [[Earl Hooker]], Henry Strong, and [[Bo Diddley]].<ref name=\"Mswriters\">{{cite web |url=http://www.mswritersandmusicians.com/musicians/otis-smothers.html|title=Otis \"Big Smokey\" Smothers|author=Browning, Janet |publisher=Mississippi Writers & Musicians |accessdate=March 1, 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn 1956 and 1957, [[Howlin' Wolf]] invited Smothers to play as his rhythm guitarist on several [[Chess Records|Chess]] tracks, including \"Who's Been Talking,\" \"Tell Me,\" \"Change My Way,\" \"Goin' Back Home,\" \"The Natchez Burning,\" and \"I Asked For Water.\"  Smothers secured a [[recording contract]] with [[Federal Records]] in August 1960. With [[Sonny Thompson]] as his [[record producer]], and [[Freddie King]] on [[lead guitar]], Smothers saw the resultant album, ''Smokey Smothers Sings the Backporch Blues'' released in 1962.  Another four track session followed, including \"Twist With Me Annie\", a reworked version of \"[[Work with Me, Annie]].\" As a part-time member of [[Muddy Waters]]' backing band, Smothers also cut \"I Got My Eyes on You,\" in 1968.<ref name=\"AMG\"/><ref name=\"Mswriters\"/>\n\nSmothers help to form the Muddy Waters Junior Band in the late 1950s, as tribute to Muddy Waters.  While Muddy Waters was on the road, Smothers and company would hold down Muddy's regular residency gigs in Chicago, performing Muddy's material and serving as a training ground for potential future members of Waters' own band, which both he and fellow 'Junior' band member [[George \"Mojo\" Buford]] eventually joined.\n\nThe 1970s were a lean time for Smothers, but he finally returned to recording in 1986, when Red Beans Records issued his album, ''Got My Eyes On You.'' His backing band were billed as The Ice Cream Men, a nod to Smothers working as an [[ice cream]] vendor back in the 1950s.<ref name=\"Mswriters\"/>\n\nSmothers wrote songs for Muddy Waters, and has a catalogue of songs to his credit including his, \"I've Been Drinking Muddy Water\",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bj1UfGVKa-U |title=Smokey Smothers - I've Been Drinking Muddy Water |publisher=YouTube |date=2010-04-27 |accessdate=2013-09-08}}</ref> \"Ain't Gon Be No Monkey Man\", and \"Can't Judge Nobody.\"\n\nLatterly suffering from [[heart disease]], Smothers died in Chicago at the age of 64, in July 1993.<ref name=\"Dead\">{{cite web|author=Doc Rock |url=http://thedeadrockstarsclub.com/1992.html |title=The Dead Rock Stars Club 1992 - 1993 |publisher=Thedeadrockstarsclub.com |date= |accessdate=2013-09-08}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-4182376.html |title=Otis Smothers, 64, Delta Blues Bass Guitarist |publisher=Highbeam.com |accessdate=2013-09-08}}</ref>\n\nA daughter is currently in process of bringing the brothers, Otis \"Big Smokey\" Smothers and younger brother Abe \"Little Smokey\" Smothers, life story to the big screen.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} Smothers is survived by wife, Earline Smothers, his sons, daughters, five brothers and sisters, and extended family.\n\n==Discography==\n===Albums===\n*''Sings the Backporch Blues'' (1962) - [[King Records (USA)|King]]\n*''Drivin' Blues'' (1966) - King (re-issue of ''Sings the Backporch Blues'')<ref>{{cite web|url=http://koti.mbnet.fi/wdd/freddieking.htm |title=WangDangDula.com |publisher=Koti.mbnet.fi |date= |accessdate=2013-09-08}}</ref>\n*''Got My Eyes on You'' (1986) - Red Beans<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/otis-smokey-smothers-mn0000893939/discography |title=Otis Smokey Smothers &#124; Discography |publisher=AllMusic |date= |accessdate=2013-09-08}}</ref>\n\n===Compilation albums===\n*''Chicago Blues Session Volume 1'' (1998) - Wolf<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/otis-smokey-smothers-mn0000893939/discography/compilations |title=Otis Smokey Smothers &#124; Discography |publisher=AllMusic |date= |accessdate=2013-09-08}}</ref>\n\n==Bibliography==\n*Larkin, Colin, ed.
