He visited his mother in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]], in 1954 and 1955, and joined the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] the following year. In addition to serving his country, Drummer learned to play the drums during his three-year period of duty.  By 1959, he had permanently relocated to Chicago, where he remains to the present.<ref name=\"Hanson\"/>\n\nIn 1960, he joined a band containing [[Lovie Lee]] and [[Carey Bell]], and later played drums for about a year for [[Eddie King (musician)|Eddie King]].<ref name=\"Hanson\"/>  After forming his own band, the Starliters, Drummer recorded a couple of tracks, \"Lookin' For My Baby\" and \"I Can't Stop Twisting,\" with a local [[record label]], Wonderful Records, but these were never released.<ref name=\"Drummer\">{{cite web |url=http://www.johnnydrummermusic.com/ |title=Meet Johnny Drummer |author= |date= |work= |publisher=Johnnydrummermusic.com |accessdate=December 10, 2011}}</ref>  In 1965, Drummer also recorded vocal [[overdubbing|overdubs]] on two tracks for [[Billy \"The Kid\" Emerson]], but these were also not issued.<ref name=\"Drummer\"/> During the 1960s, the Starliters variously included [[Sammy Lawhorn]] and [[Eddie Shaw]]. Drummer also played on several of Eddie King's singles, and in 1965 once played with [[B.B. King]] at a concert when King's regular drummer did not arrive. Drummer was reluctantly  pressed forward in his own band's line-up to sing, and left regular drum playing to others.<ref name=\"Drummer\"/>\n\nIn 1974, Drummer obtained full-time employment with the [[Chicago Police Department]], where he worked for twenty years.<ref name=\"Drummer\"/>  However, he continued to play music in the evenings, having learned the rudiments of harmonica playing from [[Junior Wells]].<ref name=\"Hanson\"/> In the latter part of that decade, Drummer recorded  \"The Fire is Gone\" and \"I'll Find a Way,\" which were released as a single by [[Cobra Records|Abco Records]].<ref name=\"Drummer\"/>  By 1985 Drummer had switched to playing the keyboards, and he and his band opened for many musicians including [[Denise LaSalle]], [[Z.Z. Hill]], [[Koko Taylor]], [[Tyrone Davis]] and [[Willie Mabon]].<ref name=\"Hanson\"/>\n\nHis debut [[album]], ''It's So Nice'' was released on [[Earwig Music Company|Earwig]] in 1999.<ref name=\"Hanson\"/> [[Cub Koda]] noted, \"his knack for a catchy phrases and lyrical hooks coupled with funky grooves and solid instrumental mixes makes this album a real sleeper\".<ref>{{cite web|author=[[Cub Koda]] |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/its-so-nice-mw0000666848 |title=It's So Nice - Johnny Drummer &#124; Songs, Reviews, Credits, Awards |publisher=AllMusic |date= |accessdate=2014-01-26}}</ref> Subsequent album releases were ''Unleaded Blues'' (2001) and  ''Rockin' in the Juke Joint'' (2007).<ref name=\"AMG\"/>\n\n==Discography==\n\n===Albums===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!
