By age ten, Yancey had toured across the United States as a tap dancer and singer, and by twenty he had toured throughout Europe. He began teaching himself piano at 15, and by 1915 had become a noted pianist and was already influencing younger musicians, including [[Meade Lux Lewis]] and [[Albert Ammons]].<ref name=\"AMG\"/><ref name=\"Music\"/>\n\nWhile he played in a boogie-woogie style, with a strong-repeated figure in the left hand and melodic decoration in the right, his playing was delicate and subtle, rather than hard driving. He popularized the left-hand figure that became known as the \"Yancey bass\", later used in [[Pee Wee Crayton]]'s \"[[Blues After Hours]]\", [[Guitar Slim]]'s \"The Things That I Used to Know\", and many other songs.<ref name=\"russell\">{{cite book\n| first= Tony\n| last= Russell\n| year= 1997\n| title= The Blues - From Robert Johnson to Robert Cray\n| edition= \n| publisher=Carlton Books Limited \n| location= Dubai\n| pages= 193\u2013194\n| isbn= 1-85868-255-X}}</ref>  Yancey favored keys\u2014such as E flat and A flat\u2014that were atypical for barrelhouse blues.<ref name=\"AMG\"/> Distinctively, he ended may pieces in the key of E-flat, even if he had played in a different key right up to the ending.\n\nAlthough influential from a young age, Yancey did not record at all through his early career, performing only at house parties and clubs. His first recordings in 1939 created a considerable stir in blues and jazz circles.<ref>Olderen, Martin van, ''The Immortal Jimmy Yancey 1898-1951'', liner notes, [[Oldie Blues]], OL 2802, 1974</ref>\n\nWhile most of his recordings were solo, later in his career he and his wife [[Estelle Yancey]] recorded together (she as a vocalist) under the name 'Jimmy and Mama Yancey'.<ref name=\"russell\"/> They appeared in concert at [[Carnegie Hall]] in 1948,<ref name=\"AMG\"/> and recorded their first album in 1951\u2014released by [[Atlantic Records]] the following year.<ref name=\"AMG\"/>\n\nDuring [[World War I]], Yancey played baseball for the Chicago All-Americans, a [[Negro league baseball]] team.
