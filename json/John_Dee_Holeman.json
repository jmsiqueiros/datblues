While still a teenager, he started playing music at house parties, Saturday night suppers, and community gatherings throughout his area of rural North Carolina. At country dances, Holman also learned the tradition of \"patting juba.\" Juba, the use of complex hand rhythms to provide timing for dancers, is a centuries-old tradition among Africans and African Americans. Where Holman grew up, it was customary when party musicians took a break for males to engage in competitive solo dancing accompanied only by hand or \"patting\" rhythms. \"Juba\" refers to both the complex hand rhythms and the dance traditionally done to them. The dance done to the juba rhythm is also called \"buckdance,\" \"bust down,\" and \"jigging.\" \"Patting\" is distinguished from clapping by virtue of the varied pitches the patting hand elicits from the arms, chest, thighs, and flanks.\"\n<ref name=\"NEA\">{{cite web |url=http://www.nea.gov/honors/heritage/fellows/fellow.php?id=1988_06&type=bio |title=1988 NEA National Heritage Fellow; John Dee Holman |author= |date= |work= |publisher=Nea.gov |accessdate=October 22, 2011}}</ref>\n\nDuring his working lifetime, Holman had full-time employment was a construction worker, and music was a part-time pursuit.<ref name=\"NEA\"/> However, \nHolman toured both in the United States and overseas in the 1980s, which included performances at [[New York City|New York]]'s [[Carnegie Hall]], and abroad on behalf of the [[United States Information Agency]]'s 'Arts America' program.<ref name=\"AMG\"/> In 1980, Holeman played at the 42nd [[National Folk Festival (USA)|National Folk Festival]] at [[Wolf Trap National Park for the Performing Arts|Wolf Trap]], [[Virginia]].<ref>{{cite book\n| first= Bruce\n| last= Bastin\n| year= 1995\n| title= Red River blues: the blues tradition in the Southeast\n| edition= 1st\n| publisher= University of Illinois Press \n| location= [[Champaign, Illinois]]\n| isbn= 0-252-01213-5\n| page= 289}}</ref> He has performed yearly at the Black Banjo Festival in Boone North Carolina.
