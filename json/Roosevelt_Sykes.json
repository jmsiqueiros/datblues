He was a successful and prolific cigar-chomping [[blues]] [[piano]] player, whose rollicking thundering [[boogie-woogie]] was highly influential.<ref name=\"philbrodieband\">{{cite web\n|url=http://philbrodieband.com/muso_roosevelt_sykes.htm |title=Phil Brodie Band Tribute Page - Roosevelt Sykes |publisher=|accessdate=2006-11-26 }}</ref>\n\n==Career==\nBorn in Elmar, [[Arkansas]], Sykes grew up near [[Helena, Arkansas|Helena]] but at age 15, went on the road playing [[piano]] with a barrelhouse style of blues. Like many bluesmen of his time, he travelled around playing to all-male audiences in sawmill, turpentine and levee camps along the [[Mississippi River]], gathering a repertoire of raw, sexually explicit material. His wanderings eventually brought him to [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]], [[Missouri]], where he met [[St. Louis Jimmy Oden]].,<ref name=\"Trail\">{{cite web |url=http://www.thebluestrail.com/artists/mus_rs.htm |title=Roosevelt Sykes |author= |date= |work= |publisher=Thebluestrail.com |accessdate=November 19, 2011}}</ref> author of the [[blues standard]] \"[[Goin' Down Slow]]\".\n\nIn 1929 he was spotted by a talent scout and sent to [[New York City|New York]] to record for [[Okeh Records]].<ref name=\"russell\">{{cite book |first= Tony | last= Russell | year= 1997 | title= The Blues - From [[Robert Johnson (musician)|Robert Johnson]] to [[Robert Cray]] | edition= | publisher=Carlton Books Limited | location= Dubai | pages= 171\u201372 | isbn= 1-85868-255-X}}</ref> His first release was \"[[44 Blues|'44' Blues]]\" which became a [[blues standard]] and his trademark.<ref name=\"russell\"/> He quickly began [[sound recording and reproduction|recording]] for multiple [[record label|labels]] under various names including 'Easy Papa Johnson', 'Dobby Bragg' and 'Willie Kelly'. After he and Oden moved to [[Chicago]] he found his first period of [[celebrity|fame]] when he signed with [[Decca Records]] in 1934.<ref name=\"russell\"/> In 1943, he signed with [[Bluebird Records]] and recorded with 'The Honeydrippers'.<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.aaregistry.org/historic_events/view/roosevelt-sykes-could-play-those-88s\n|title=Roosevelt Sykes could play those 88's\n|publisher=African American Registry\n|accessdate=2006-11-26 \n|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20061027023438/http://www.aaregistry.com/african_american_history/676/Roosevelt_Sykes_could_play_those_88s <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2006-10-27}}</ref> Sykes and Oden continued their musical friendship well into the 60s.\n\nIn Chicago, Sykes began to display an increasing urbanity in his [[lyrics|lyric]]-writing, using an [[eight-bar blues]] [[popular music|pop]] [[Gospel music|gospel]] structure instead of the traditional [[twelve-bar blues]]. However, despite the growing urbanity of his outlook, he gradually became less competitive in the post-[[World War II]] music scene.  After his [[RCA Victor]] contract expired, he continued to record for smaller labels, such as [[United Records|United]], until his opportunities ran out in the mid-1950s.<ref name=\"russell\"/>\n\nRoosevelt left Chicago in 1954 for [[New Orleans]] as [[electric blues]] was taking over the [[Chicago blues]] [[nightclub|clubs]]. When he returned to recording in the 1960s it was for labels such as [[Delmark Records|Delmark]], [[Bluesville Records|Bluesville]], [[Storyville Records|Storyville]] and [[Folkways Records|Folkways]] that were documenting the quickly passing blues history.<ref name=\"shaw\">{{cite book | first= Arnold | last= Shaw | year= 1978 | title= Honkers and Shouters | edition=  | publisher=Macmillan Publishing Company | location= New York | pages= 14\u201317 | isbn= 0-02-061740-2}}</ref> He lived out his final years in New Orleans, where he died from a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]]<ref>[http://thedeadrockstarsclub.com/1980.html Thedeadrockstarsclub.com - accessed November 2009]</ref> on July 17, 1983.<ref name=\"philbrodieband\"/>\n\n==Legacy==\nSykes had a long career spanning the pre-war and postwar eras. His pounding piano boogies and risqu\u00e9 lyrics characterize his contributions to the blues.
