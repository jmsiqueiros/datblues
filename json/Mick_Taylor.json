I just really wanted to get up on stage and play the guitar.\"\n\nTaylor played the second set with Mayall's band, and after winning Mayall's respect, they exchanged phone numbers. This encounter proved to be pivotal in Taylor's career when Mayall began to look for a guitarist to fill [[Peter Green (musician)|Peter Green]]'s vacancy the following year.

From 1966 to 1969, Taylor developed a guitar style that is blues-based with [[Latin American music|Latin]] and [[jazz]] influences. He is the guitarist on the Bluesbreaker albums \"Diary of a Band\", \"Barewires\" and \"Blues from Laurel Canyon\".

At the time Jagger stated: \"We made [tracks] with just Mick Taylor, which are very good and everyone loves, where Keith wasn't there for whatever reasons ...

Cherry Red Books, 2002. ISBN 1-901447-04-9</ref> Not much was achieved during the first 10 days at Musicland. Most of the actual recordings were made in January (Musicland) and April of 1974 (Stargroves). When Taylor resumed work with the band, he found it difficult to get along with Richards. At one point during the Munich sessions, Richards confronted him and said, \"Oi! Taylor! You're playing too fuckin' loud. I mean, you're really good ''live,'' man, but you're fucking useless in the studio. Lay out, play later, whatever.\" Richards erased some of the tapes where Taylor had recorded guitar parts to some of the songs for ''It's Only Rock n' Roll''.<ref>Davis 2004, p. 387.</ref> Taylor was, however, present at all the sessions in April at [[Stargroves]], England, where the LP was finished and most of the overdubs were recorded.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}\n\nNot long after those recording sessions, Taylor went on a six-week expedition to Brazil, traveling down the [[Amazon River]] in a boat and exploring [[Latin music]].\n\nJust before the release of the album in October 1974, Taylor told [[Nick Kent]] from the ''[[New Musical Express|NME]]'' magazine about the new LP and that he had co-written \"[[Till the Next Goodbye]]\" and \"[[Time Waits for No One (song)|Time Waits for No One]]\" with Jagger.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} Kent showed Taylor the record sleeve, which revealed the absence of any songwriting credits for Taylor.\n\n{{quote|text=I was a bit peeved about not getting credit for a couple of songs, but that wasn't the whole reason [I left the band].

I think he found it difficult to get on with Keith.\" In the same interview Jagger said of Taylor's contribution to the band: \"I think he had a big contribution. He made it very musical. He was a very fluent, melodic player, which we never had, and we don't have now. Neither Keith nor [[Ronnie Wood]] plays that kind of style. It was very good for me working with him ... Mick Taylor would play very fluid lines against my vocals. He was exciting, and he was very pretty, and it gave me something to follow, to bang off.

A blues guitarist with a jazzman's flair for melodic invention, Taylor was never a rock and roller and never a showman.\"{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}\n\nTaylor has worked with his former bandmates on various occasions since leaving the Rolling Stones. In 1977 he attended London-based sessions for the [[John Phillips (musician)|John Phillips]] album ''[[Pay Pack & Follow]]'', appearing on several tracks alongside Jagger (vocals), Richards (guitar) and Wood (bass) - taking notable solos on the songs \"Oh Virginia\" and \"Zulu Warrior\". A possibly apocryphal story is that after Taylor played a particularly jaw-dropping solo in the studio, Richards half-jokingly exclaimed, \"That's why I never liked you, you bastard!\".\n\nOn 14 December 1981 he performed with the band at their concert at the [[Kemper Arena]] in [[Kansas City, Missouri]].<ref name=\"nzentgraf\"/> Keith Richards appeared on stage at a Mick Taylor show at the [[Lone Star Cafe]] in New York on 28 December 1986, jamming on \"[[Key to the Highway]]\" and \"[[Can't You Hear Me Knocking]]\"; and Taylor is featured on one track (\"I Could Have Stood You Up\") on Richards' 1988 album ''[[Talk is Cheap (album)|Talk is Cheap]]''.

The Rolling Stones in Concert|Get Yer Ya-Yas Out!]]'', recorded over four concerts at [[Madison Square Garden]] in New York and the Civic Center in Baltimore in November 1969; in the documentary films ''Stones in the Park'' (released on DVD in 2001), ''[[Gimme Shelter (1970 film)|Gimme Shelter]]'' (released in 1970) and ''[[Cocksucker Blues]]'' (unreleased); and in the concert film ''[[Ladies and Gentlemen: The Rolling Stones]]'' (shown in cinemas in 1974, and released on DVD and Blu-ray in 2010). Bootleg recordings from the Rolling Stones' tours from 1969 through 1973 also document Taylor's concert performances with the Rolling Stones.\n\nIn March 2010, rumours started circulating that Taylor had contributed guitar work on the upcoming ''[[Exile on Main Street]]'' special edition release. This expanded version of the original double album includes 10 outtakes/alternate versions of songs. Taylor later revealed (in an interview with a journalist from Cleveland) that he had indeed recorded new guitar overdubs for the CD, at Mick Jagger's request. On 17 April 2010 (National Record Store Day), the new Rolling Stones single \"[[Plundered My Soul]]\" came out, featuring recently recorded vocals and guitars by Jagger and Taylor.\n\nAround this time, Eagle Rock Entertainment also announced that a first official release of the concert film ''[[Ladies and Gentlemen: The Rolling Stones]]'' was planned for autumn 2010. Apart from a one-off cinema screening in the past, the film had previously only been available on bootleg videos and DVDs.\n\n===1975\u201381: Post-Stones===\n[[File:Mick Taylor 1984.jpg|thumb|180px|left|Taylor in [[Barcelona]] in 1984]]\nTaylor worked on various side projects during his tenure with the Rolling Stones.\n\nIn June 1973, he joined [[Mike Oldfield]] onstage at the [[Queen Elizabeth Hall]] in a performance of Oldfield's ''[[Tubular Bells]]''. Taylor was asked to take part in this project by [[Richard Branson]] as he felt Oldfield was unknown, having just been signed to Branson's fledgling label, [[Virgin Records]]. Taylor joined Oldfield once more for a [[BBC television]] broadcast in November 1973.\n\nAfter his resignation from the Rolling Stones, [[Jack Bruce]] invited him to form a new band with [[keyboardist]] [[Carla Bley]] and drummer [[Bruce Gary]]. In 1975, the band began rehearsals in London with tour dates scheduled for later that year. The group toured Europe, with a sound leaning more toward [[jazz]], including a performance at the Dutch [[Pinkpop festival]], but disbanded the following year. A performance recorded on 1 June 1975 (which was finally released on CD in 2003 as ''\"Live at the Manchester Free Trade Hall\"'' by The Jack Bruce Band) and another performance from the ''[[Old Grey Whistle Test]]'' seem to be the only material available from this brief collaboration.\n\nTaylor appeared as a special guest of [[Little Feat]] at the [[Rainbow Theatre]] in London, 1977, sharing [[slide guitar]] with then-frontman [[Lowell George]] on \"A Apolitical Blues\": this song appears on [[Little Feat]]'s critically acclaimed live album ''[[Waiting for Columbus]]''.<ref>{{cite web|author=Waiting for Columbus (Bonus CD) (Dlx) |url=http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0000631ED |title=Waiting for Columbus (Bonus CD) (Dlx): Music |publisher=Amazon.com |accessdate=2012-12-11}}</ref>\nIn the summer of 1977 he collaborated with [[Pierre Moerlen's Gong]] for the album ''[[Expresso II]]'', released in 1978. Taylor began writing new songs and recruiting musicians for a solo album and worked on projects with Miller Anderson, [[Alan Merrill]] and others. He was present at many of the recording sessions for [[John Phillips (musician)|John Phillips]]' prospective second solo album. The recordings for Phillips' album took place in London over a prolonged period between 1973 and 1977. This led to Taylor working with Keith Richards and Mick Jagger who were also working on the Phillips' album. [[Atlantic Records]] eventually cancelled the project but copies of the sessions (under the titles \"Half Stoned\" and \"Phillips '77\") circulated among bootleg traders. The original tapes were rescued and restored and were officially released in 2002 as ''[[Pay Pack & Follow]]''.\n[[File:Mick Taylor- John Mayall concert 1980s.jpg|thumb|230px|right|Taylor performing with [[John Mayall]] in the early 1980s]]\nIn 1977 Taylor signed a solo recording deal with [[Columbia Records]]. By April 1978 he had given several interviews to music magazines to promote the new album which was finished but would not be released for another year. In 1979 the album, titled ''[[Mick Taylor (album)|Mick Taylor]]'', was released by [[Columbia Records]]. The album material mixed rock, jazz and Latin-flavoured blues musical styles. The album reached #119 on the [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] charts in early August with a stay of five weeks on the [[Billboard 200]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} CBS advised Taylor to promote the album through American radio stations but was unwilling to back the guitarist for any supporting tour.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} Already frustrated with this situation, Taylor took a break from the music industry for about a year.\n\nIn 1981, he toured Europe and the United States with [[Alvin Lee]] of [[Ten Years After]], sharing the bill with [[Black Sabbath]]. He spent most of 1982 and 1983 on the road with [[John Mayall]], for the \"Reunion Tour\" with [[John McVie]] of [[Fleetwood Mac]] and [[Colin Allen]]. During this tour [[Bob Dylan]] showed up backstage at [[The Roxy Theatre|The Roxy]] in Los Angeles in order to meet Taylor.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}\n\nIn 1983, Taylor joined [[Mark Knopfler]] and played on Dylan's ''[[Infidels]]'' album. He also appeared on Dylan's live album ''[[Real Live]]'', as well as the follow-up studio album ''[[Empire Burlesque]]''. In 1984, Dylan asked Mick Taylor to assemble an experienced rock and roll band for a European tour he signed with [[Bill Graham (promoter)|Bill Graham]]. [[Ian McLagan]] was hired to play piano and hammond organ, Greg Sutton to play bass and Colin Allen, a long-time friend of Taylor, on drums. The tour lasted for four weeks at venues such as Munich's Olympic Stadium Arena and Milan's San Siro Stadium, sharing the bill with [[Carlos Santana]] and [[Joan Baez]], who appeared on the same bill for a couple of shows.\n\n===1988\u2013present: Later work===\n[[File:Mick Taylor-and guitar.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Taylor performing in Wonderland Blues NYC, 1989]]\n\nTaylor guested with the [[Grateful Dead]] on September 24, 1988 at the last show of that year's [[Madison Square Garden]] run in New York. Taylor lived in New York throughout the 1980s. He battled with addiction problems before getting back on track in the second half of the 1980s and moving to Los Angeles in 1990.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} During this time Taylor did session work and toured in Europe, America and Japan with a band including [[Max Middleton]] (formerly of the [[Jeff Beck Group]]), [[Shane Fontayne]], and [[Blondie Chaplin]]. In 1990 his CD \"[[Stranger In This Town]]\" was released by Maze Records backed up by a mini-tour including the record release party at the [[Hard Rock Cafe]] in  as well as gigs at the [[Paradise Rock Club|Paradise Theater]].\n\nTaylor moved back to England in the mid-1990s. He released a new album in 2000 entitled ''A Stone's Throw''. Playing at clubs and theatres as well as appearing at festivals has connected Taylor with an appreciative audience and fan base.\n\nHe began what was to be a significant series of collaborations with [[Carla Olson]] with their \"Live at the Roxy\" album ''Too Hot For Snakes'', the centerpiece of which is an extended seven-minute performance of \"[[Sway (The Rolling Stones song)|Sway]]\". Another highlight is the lead track on the album, \"Who Put the Sting (On the Honey Bee),\" by Olson's then-bassist [[Jesse Sublett]]. It was followed by Olson's ''Within An Ace'' which featured Taylor on seven songs, he appeared on three songs from ''Reap The Whirlwind'' and then again on Olson's ''The Ring Of Truth'', on which he plays lead guitar on nine tracks including a twelve minute version of the Jagger and Taylor song \"Winter\". Further work by Olson and Taylor can be heard on the Olson produced [[Barry Goldberg]] album ''Stoned Again''. Taylor went on to appear on [[Percy Sledge]]'s ''Blue Night'' (1994), along with [[Steve Cropper]], [[Bobby Womack]] and [[Greg Leisz]].\n\nIn 2003, Taylor reunited with [[John Mayall]] for his [[70th Birthday Concert]] in Liverpool along with [[Eric Clapton]]. A year later, in autumn 2004, he also joined John Mayall and the Bluesbreakers for a UK theatre tour. He toured the US East Coast with the [[Experience Hendrix]] group during October 2007. The Experience Hendrix group appeared at a series of concerts which were a homage to [[Jimi Hendrix]] and his musical legacy. Taylor played with [[Mitch Mitchell]], [[Billy Cox]], [[Buddy Guy]], [[Hubert Sumlin]] and [[Robby Krieger]].\n\n[[File:Mick Taylor and the Rolling Stones in 2013.jpg|thumb|260px|Taylor performing with the Rolling Stones on their 50 & Counting tour in MA, 12 June 2013]]\nOn 1 December 2010, Taylor reunited with [[Ronnie Wood]] at a benefit gig arranged by blues guitarist [[Stephen Dale Petit]] to save the [[100 Club]] in London. Other special guests at the show were [[Dick Taylor]] (first bassist in the Rolling Stones) and blues/jazz trombonist [[Chris Barber]]. Taylor toured the UK with Petit, appearing as his special guest, featured on a Paul Jones BBC Radio 2 session with him and guested on Petit's 2010 ''Classic Rock'' magazine Album of the Year, ''The Crave''.{{clarify|date=January 2012}}\n\nFor the 2010 re-release of ''[[Exile On Main Street]]'' Taylor worked with Mick Jagger in the studio to record new guitar and vocal parts for the previously unreleased song, ''[[Plundered My Soul]]''. The track was selected by the Rolling Stones for release as a limited edition single on National Record Store Day.\n\nHe also helped to promote the ''Boogie For Stu'' album, which was recorded by Ben Waters to honour [[Ian Stewart (musician)|Ian Stewart]] (original Stones pianist and co-founder of the band), by taking part in a concert to mark the CD's official launch at the Ambassadors Theatre, London on 9 March 2011. Proceeds from the event were donated to the [[British Heart Foundation]].

Other guitars include a [[Gibson ES-355]] for the recording of ''Sticky Fingers'' and ''Exile on Main Street'', a [[Gibson SG]] on the 1969, 1970 and 1971 tours, and occasionally a [[Fender Stratocaster]] and a [[Fender Telecaster]].\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Mick Taylor}}\n*[http://www.micktaylor.com/ Mick Taylor's Official Website]\n*[http://www.micktaylor.net/ Mick Taylor.net]\n*[http://www.classicbands.com/MickTaylorInterview.html Interview with Gary James from classicbands.com]\n*[http://www.jazzedmagazine.com/ME2/dirmod.asp?sid=&nm=&type=Publishing&mod=Publications%3A%3AArticle&mid=8F3A7027421841978F18BE895F87F791&tier=4&id=1906255FFDB44D00B523627031537F7C Interview with JAZZed Magazine.
