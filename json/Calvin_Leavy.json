He was the youngest son of fifteen children, and started singing in his church choir.  By his adolescence, Leavy sang with various [[gospel music|gospel]] [[musical ensemble|ensembles]] in [[Little Rock, Arkansas|Little Rock]]. He formed the Leavy Brothers Band in 1954, and they were popular locally, before relocating to [[Fresno, California]]. By the end of 1968, they moved back to Little Rock, and played at local [[nightclub|clubs]].  Through this work, Leavy was offered recording time in E&M Studios in Little Rock.  As well as a [[cover version]] of \"[[Tennessee Waltz]]\", the group recorded the song \"Cummins Prison Farm\", which was written by Bill Cole.  Leavy used the prison experiences of one of his brothers to expand the lyrical content.<ref name=\"Arkansas\">{{cite web |url=http://encyclopediaofarkansas.net/encyclopedia/entry-detail.aspx?entryID=6346 |title=Calvin James \"Slim\" Leavy (1940\u20132010) |author=Gwendolyn L.

In addition, the band made some recordings for the Arkansas Bicentennial Blues Project, which were archived at the [[University of Arkansas at Little Rock]]. They also appeared in 1977 at the [[Memphis in May|Beale Street Music Festival]], before disbanding. Forming Calvin Leavy and the Professionals, he and his new outfit remained popular locally. They recorded \"Is It Worth All (That I'm Going Through)\", \"Big Four\", \"What Kind of Love\", \"Free From Cummins Prison Farm\", and the prophetic \"If Life Last Luck Is Bound to Change\".
