The band's sound featured his melodic, blues-based guitar lines set against Latin and African rhythms featuring percussion instruments such as [[timbales]] and [[conga]]s not generally heard in rock music. Santana continued to work in these forms over the following decades. He experienced a resurgence of popularity and critical acclaim in the late 1990s. In 2003 ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine listed Santana at number 20 <ref>\"100 Greatest Guitarists of all Time.\" Rolling Stone, . http://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/100-greatest-guitarists-20111123/carlos-santana-20111122 (accessed January 12, 2013).</ref> on their list of the 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time.<ref>{{cite web|author=Posted Sep 18, 2003 12:00 AM |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/5937559/the_100_greatest_guitarists_of_all_time |title='&#39;The 100 Greatest Guitar players of All Time'&#39;; '&#39;Rolling Stone'&#39; |work=Rolling Stone  |date=2003-09-18 |accessdate=2010-03-13}} {{Dead link|date=November 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> He has won 10 [[Grammy Awards]] and three [[Latin Grammy Awards]].<ref>{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=santana-p13645/charts-awards/grammy-awards|pure_url=yes}}|publisher=allmusic|title=Santana received 10 Grammy Awards and 3 Latin Grammy Awards|year=1999|accessdate=2010-10-20}}</ref>\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early life===\nCarlos Santana was born in [[Autl\u00e1n|Autl\u00e1n de Navarro]], [[Jalisco]], [[Mexico]]. He learned to play the violin at age five, and the guitar at age eight. His younger brother, [[Jorge Santana]], would also become a professional guitarist. Young Carlos was heavily influenced by [[Ritchie Valens]] at a time when there were very few Latinos in American rock and [[pop music]]. The family moved from Autl\u00e1n de Navarro to [[Tijuana]], the city on Mexico's border with [[California]], and then [[San Francisco]]. Carlos stayed in Tijuana but later joined his family in San Francisco, graduating from James Lick Middle School, and in 1965 from [[Mission High School (San Francisco)|Mission High School]].  Carlos was accepted at [[California State University, Northridge]], and [[Humboldt State University]], but turned down these offers.\n\n===Early career===\n{{Quote box\n| quote  = \"The '60s were a leap in human consciousness. [[Mahatma Gandhi]], [[Malcolm X]], [[Martin Luther King]], [[Che Guevara]], [[Mother Teresa]], they led a revolution of conscience.

King]]) perform live in San Francisco. He was also introduced to a variety of new musical influences, including [[jazz]] and [[folk music]], and witnessed the growing [[hippie]] movement centered in San Francisco in the 1960s. After several years spent working as a [[dishwasher]] in a diner and [[busking]] for spare change, Santana decided to become a full-time musician. In 1966 he gained prominence due to a series of accidental events, all happening on the same day. Santana was a frequent spectator at [[Bill Graham (promoter)|Bill Graham]]'s [[Fillmore West]]. During a Sunday matinee show, [[Paul Butterfield]] was slated to perform there but was unable to do so as a result of being intoxicated.  Bill Graham assembled an impromptu band of musicians he knew primarily through his connections with the [[Grateful Dead]], Butterfield's own band, and [[Jefferson Airplane]], but he had not yet chosen all the guitarists. Santana's manager, Stan Marcum, immediately suggested to Graham that Santana join the impromptu band and Graham agreed. During the jam session, Santana's guitar playing and solo gained the notice of both the audience and Graham.<ref>Shapiro, Marc, \u201cCarlos Santana: Back on Top\u201d, pages 57-58, St. Martin\u2019s Press, ISBN 0-312-26904-8, 2000.</ref> During the same year, Santana formed the Santana Blues Band, with fellow street musicians [[David Brown (musician)|David Brown]]  (bass guitar) , [[Marcus Malone]]  (percussion) and [[Gregg Rolie]] (lead vocals, [[Hammond Organ#B-3 / C-3 / RT-3 / A-100 / D-100 / E-100 / H-100 series|Hammond Organ B3]]).<ref name=\"allmusic\">{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p195903|pure_url=yes}}|title=Carlos Santana > Biography|last=Ruhlmann|first=William|year=2003|publisher=allmusic|accessdate=2009-06-25}}</ref>\n\nWith their highly original blend of Latin-infused rock, jazz, blues, salsa, and African rhythms, the band (which quickly adopted their [[frontman]]'s name, Santana) gained an immediate following on the San Francisco club circuit. The band's early success, capped off by a memorable performance at Woodstock in 1969, led to him signing a recording contract with [[Columbia Records]], then run by [[Clive Davis]].\n\n==''Santana''==\n\n===Record deal, Woodstock breakthrough and height of success: 1969-72===\n''[[Santana (band)|Santana]]'' was signed by [[Columbia Records#The 1960s|CBS Records]] and went into the studio to record their first album. They were not satisfied with the release and decided changes needed to be made. This resulted in the dismissal of drummer Bob Livingston. Santana replaced him with [[Mike Shrieve]], who had a strong background in both jazz and rock. Percussionist [[Marcus Malone]] was forced to quit the band due to involuntary manslaughter charges, and the band re-enlisted Michael Carabello. Carabello brought with him percussionist [[Jos\u00e9 Areas|Jose Chepito Areas]], who was already well known in his country, [[Nicaragua]], and, with his skills and professional experience, was a major contributor to the band.\n\n[[Bill Graham (promoter)|Bill Graham]], a Latin Music aficionado, had been a fan of the band from its inception, and arranged for them to appear at the [[Woodstock Festival|Woodstock Music and Art Festival]] before their debut album was even released. They were one of the surprises of the festival; their set was legendary and later the exposure of their eleven-minute instrumental \"[[Soul Sacrifice]]\" in the ''[[Woodstock (film)|Woodstock]]'' film and soundtrack album vastly increased their popularity. Graham also gave the band some key advice to record the [[Willie Bobo]] song \"[[Evil Ways]]\", as he felt it would get them radio airplay. Their first album, ''[[Santana (1969 album)|Santana]]'', was released in August 1969 and became a huge hit, reaching #4 on the U.S. album charts, with the catchy single \"Evil Ways\" reaching number nine on the [[Billboard Hot 100]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}\n\n[[File:Santana 1973.jpg|thumb|left|Santana performing in Hamburg in November of 1973]]\nIn 1969, the band's performance at the [[Woodstock|Woodstock festival]] introduced them to an international audience and garnered critical acclaim, although the band's sudden success put pressure on the group, highlighting the different musical directions in which Rolie and Santana were starting to go. Rolie, along with some of the other band members, wanted to emphasize a basic [[hard rock]] sound which had been a key component in establishing the band from the start. Santana, however, was increasingly interested in moving beyond his love of blues and rock and wanted more jazzy, ethereal elements in the music, which were influenced by his fascination with [[G\u00e1bor Szab\u00f3]], [[Miles Davis]], [[Pharoah Sanders]], and [[John Coltrane]], as well as his growing interest in [[spirituality]]. At the same time, Chepito Areas was stricken with a near-fatal [[Cerebral hemorrhage|brain hemorrhage]], and Santana hoped to continue by finding a temporary replacement (first [[Willie Bobo]], then [[Coke Escovedo]]), while others in the band, especially Michael Carabello, felt it was wrong to perform publicly without Areas. Cliques formed, and the band started to disintegrate.\n\nConsolidating the interest generated by their first album, and their highly acclaimed live performance at the Woodstock Festival in August 1969, the band followed up with their second album, ''[[Abraxas (album)|Abraxas]]'', in September 1970. The album's mix of rock, blues, jazz, salsa and other influences was very well received, showing a musical maturation from their first album and refining the band's early sound. Abraxas included two of Santana's most enduring and well-known hits, \"[[Oye Como Va]],\" and \"[[Black Magic Woman|Black Magic Woman/Gypsy Queen]].\" ''Abraxas'' spent six weeks at #1 on the Billboard chart at the end of 1970.<ref>http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/73601/chart-beat-bonus</ref> The album remained on the charts for 88 weeks and was certified 4x platinum in 1986.<ref>http://www.superseventies.com/spsantana2.html</ref> In 2003 the album was ranked number 205 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time.<ref>Levy, Joe; Steven Van Zandt (2006) [2005]. \"205 | Abraxas - Santana\".

Retrieved 9 March 2006.</ref>\n\nTeenage [[San Francisco Bay Area]] guitar prodigy [[Neal Schon]] was asked to join the band in 1971, in time to complete the third album, ''[[Santana (1971 album)|Santana III]]''. The band now boasted a powerful dual-lead-guitar act that gave the album a tougher sound. The sound of the band was also helped by the return of a recuperated Chepito Areas and the assistance of Coke Escovedo in the percussion section. Enhancing the band's sound further was the support of popular Bay Area group [[Tower of Power]]'s [[horn section]], Luis Gasca of [[Malo]], and other [[session musician]]s which added to both percussion and vocals, injecting more energy to the proceedings. ''Santana III'' was another success, reaching #1 on the album charts, selling two million copies, and yielding the hits \"Everybody's Everything\" and \"[[No One to Depend On]]\".\n\n[[File:Carlos Santana 123176.jpg|thumb|right|New Year's Eve 1976 at the [[Cow Palace]] in San Francisco]]\nTension between members of the band continued, however. Along with musical differences, drug use became a problem, and Santana was deeply worried that it was affecting the band's performance. Coke Escovedo encouraged Santana to take more control of the band's musical direction, much to the dismay of some of the others who thought that the band and its sound was a collective effort. Also, financial irregularities were exposed while under the management of Stan Marcum, whom Bill Graham criticized as being incompetent. Growing resentments between Santana and Michael Carabello over lifestyle issues resulted in his departure on bad terms. James Mingo Lewis was hired at the last minute as a replacement at a concert in New York City. David Brown later left due to substance abuse problems. A South American tour was cut short in [[Lima, Peru]], due to student protests against U.S. governmental policies and unruly fans. The madness of the tour convinced Santana that changes needed to be made in the band and in his life.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}\n\nIn January 1972, Santana, Schon, Escovedo, and Lewis joined former [[Band of Gypsys]] drummer, [[Buddy Miles]], for a concert at Hawaii's [[Diamond Head, Hawaii|Diamond Head Crater]], which was recorded for the album ''[[Carlos Santana & Buddy Miles! Live!]]''. The performance was erratic and uneven, but the album managed to achieve gold-record status on the weight of Santana's popularity.\n\n===''Caravanserai''===\nIn early 1972, Santana and the remaining members of the band started working on their fourth album, ''[[Caravanserai (album)|Caravanserai]]''. During the studio sessions, Santana and [[Michael Shrieve]] brought in other musicians: percussionists James Mingo Lewis and Latin-Jazz veteran, [[Armando Peraza]] replacing Michael Carabello, and bassists Tom Rutley and Doug Rauch replacing [[David Brown (musician)|David Brown]]. Also assisting on keyboards were [[Wendy Haas]] and [[Tom Coster]]. With the unsettling influx of new players in the studio, [[Gregg Rolie]] and [[Neal Schon]] decided that it was time to leave after the completion of the album, even though both contributed to the session. Rolie returned home to Seattle, and later became a founding member of [[Journey (band)|Journey]] (which Schon would later join as well).\n\nWhen ''[[Caravanserai (album)|Caravanserai]]'' did emerge in 1972, it marked a strong change in musical direction towards [[jazz fusion]]. The album received critical praise, but CBS executive [[Clive Davis]] warned Santana and the band that it would sabotage the band's position as a \"[[Top 40]]\" act. Nevertheless, over the years, the album would achieve platinum status. The difficulties Santana and the band went through during this period were chronicled in [[Ben Fong-Torres]]' ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' 1972 cover story \"The Resurrection of Carlos Santana\".\n\nSantana met Deborah King, whom he later married in 1973. She is the daughter of late blues singer and guitarist [[Saunders King]]. They have three children: [[Salvador Santana|Salvador]], Stella and Angelica. Together with wife Deborah, Santana founded a not-for-profit organization, the Milagro (\"Miracle\") Foundation, which provides financial aid for educational, medical, and other needs.\n\n===Shifting styles and spirituality: 1972-79===\nIn 1972, Santana became a huge fan of pioneering fusion band [[The Mahavishnu Orchestra]] and its guitarist, [[John McLaughlin (musician)|John McLaughlin]]. Aware of Santana's interest in meditation, McLaughlin introduced Santana and Deborah to his guru, [[Sri Chinmoy]]. Chinmoy accepted them as disciples in 1973. Santana was given the name '''Devadip''', meaning \"The lamp, light and eye of God\".  Santana and McLaughlin recorded an album together, ''[[Love Devotion Surrender|Love, Devotion, Surrender]]'' with members of ''Santana'' and The Mahavishnu Orchestra, along with percussionist [[Don Alias]] and organist [[Larry Young (musician)|Larry Young]], who both had made appearances on [[Miles Davis]]' classic ''[[Bitches Brew]]'' in 1969.\n\nIn 1973 Santana, having obtained legal rights to the band's name, ''[[Santana (band)|Santana]]'', formed a new version of the band with [[Armando Peraza]] and [[Jos\u00e9 Areas|Chepito Areas]] on percussion, [[Doug Rauch]] on bass, [[Michael Shrieve]] on drums, and [[Tom Coster]] and [[Richard Kermode]] on keyboards. Santana later was able to recruit jazz vocalist [[Leon Thomas]] for a tour of Japan, which was recorded for the live, sprawling, high-energy fusion album ''[[Lotus (Santana album)|Lotus]]''. CBS records would not allow its release unless the material was condensed. Santana did not agree to those terms, and ''Lotus'' was available in the U.S. only as an expensive, imported, three-record set. The group later went into the studio and recorded ''[[Welcome (Santana album)|Welcome]]'', which further reflected Santana's interests in [[jazz fusion]] and his increasing commitment to the spiritual life of Sri Chinmoy.\n\n[[File:Carlos Santana-2 1978 by Chris Hakkens.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Santana during his \"inner secrets\" tour in the Netherlands in 1978]]\nA collaboration with [[John Coltrane]]'s widow, [[Alice Coltrane]], ''[[Illuminations (Carlos Santana & Alice Coltrane album)|Illuminations]]'', followed. The album delved into [[avant-garde]] esoteric [[free jazz]], [[East India|Eastern Indian]] and [[classical music|classical]] influences with other ex-Miles Davis sidemen [[Jack DeJohnette]] and [[Dave Holland]]. Soon after, Santana replaced his band members again. This time Kermode, Thomas and Rauch departed from the group and were replaced by vocalist [[Leon Patillo]] (later a successful [[Contemporary Christian music|Contemporary Christian]] artist) and returning bassist David Brown. He also recruited soprano saxophonist, Jules Broussard for the lineup. The band recorded one studio album ''[[Borboletta]]'', which was released in 1974. Drummer [[Leon \"Ndugu\" Chancler]] later joined the band as a replacement for [[Michael Shrieve]], who left to pursue a solo career.\n\nBy this time [[Bill Graham (promoter)|Bill Graham]]'s management company had assumed responsibility for the affairs of the group. Graham was critical of Santana's move into jazz and felt he needed to concentrate on getting ''Santana'' back into the charts with the edgy, streetwise [[Ethnic group|ethnic]] sound that had made them famous. Santana himself was seeing that the group's direction was alienating many fans. Although the albums and performances were given good reviews by critics in jazz and [[jazz fusion]] circles, sales had plummeted.\n\nSantana, along with [[Tom Coster]], producer David Rubinson, and Chancler, formed yet another version of ''Santana'', adding vocalist Greg Walker. The 1976 album ''[[Amigos (Santana album)|Amigos]]'', which featured the songs \"[[Dance, Sister, Dance]]\" and \"Let It Shine\", had a strong funk and Latin sound. The album received considerable airplay on FM [[album-oriented rock]] stations with the instrumental \"[[Europa (Earth's Cry Heaven's Smile)]]\" and re-introduced ''Santana'' to the charts. In 1976 ''Rolling Stone'' ran a second cover story on ''Santana'' entitled \"Santana Comes Home\".\n\nThe albums conceived through the late 1970s followed the same formula, although with several lineup changes. Among the new personnel who joined was current percussionist Raul Rekow, who joined in early 1977. Most notable of the band's commercial efforts of this era was a version of the 1960s [[The Zombies|Zombies]] hit, \"[[She's Not There]]\", on the 1977 album ''[[Moonflower (album)|Moonflower]]''.\n\nThe relative success of the band's albums in this era allowed Santana to pursue a solo career funded by [[Columbia Records|CBS]]. First, ''[[Oneness (Carlos Santana album)|Oneness: Silver Dreams - Golden Reality]]'', in 1979 and ''[[The Swing of Delight]]'' in 1980, which featured some of his musical heroes: [[Herbie Hancock]], [[Wayne Shorter]], [[Ron Carter]] and [[Tony Williams (drummer)|Tony Williams]] from [[Miles Davis]]' legendary 1960s quintet.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}\n\nThe pressures and temptations of being a high-profile rock musician and requirements of the spiritual lifestyle which [[guru]] [[Sri Chinmoy]] and his followers demanded were in conflict, and imposed considerable stress upon Santana's lifestyle and marriage. He was becoming increasingly disillusioned with what he thought were the unreasonable rules that Chinmoy imposed on his life, and in particular with his refusal to allow Santana and Deborah to start a family. He felt too that his fame was being used to increase the guru's visibility. Santana and Deborah eventually ended their relationship with Chinmoy in 1982.\n\n===The 1980s===\n[[File:Santana 1984.jpg|thumb|190px|right|Santana, 1984, [[Barcelona, Spain]]]]\nMore radio-pleasing singles followed from Santana and the band. \"Winning\" in 1981 (from ''[[Zebop]]'') and \"Hold On\" (a remake of Canadian artist [[Ian Thomas (Canadian musician)|Ian Thomas]]' song) in 1982 both reached the top twenty. After his break with Sri Chinmoy, Santana went into the studio to record another solo album with Keith Olson and legendary R&B producer [[Jerry Wexler]]. The 1983 album revisited Santana's early musical experiences in Tijuana with [[Bo Diddley]]'s \"Who Do You Love\" and the title cut, Chuck Berry's \"Havana Moon\".  The album's guests included [[Booker T. Jones]], [[The Fabulous Thunderbirds]], [[Willie Nelson]] and even Santana's father's mariachi orchestra. Santana again paid tribute to his early rock roots by doing the film score to ''[[La Bamba (film)|La Bamba]]'', which was based on the tragically short life of rock and roll legend [[Ritchie Valens]] and starred [[Lou Diamond Phillips]].\n\nAlthough the band had concentrated on trying to produce albums with commercial appeal during the 1980s, changing tastes in [[popular culture]] began to reflect in the band's sagging record sales of their latest effort ''[[Beyond Appearances]]''. In 1985, Bill Graham had to once again pull strings for Santana to convince principal [[Live Aid]] concert organizer [[Bob Geldof]] to allow the band to appear at the festival.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} The group's high-energy performance proved they were still a top concert draw the world over despite their poor performance on the charts. Santana regained a great deal of respect in both jazz and rock circles, with [[Prince (musician)|Prince]] and guitarist [[Kirk Hammett]] of [[Metallica]] citing him as an influence.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}\n\nThe band ''Santana'' returned in 1987 with a new album ''[[Freedom (Santana album)|Freedom]]''.\n\n[[File:Dylan-Baez-Santana.jpg|thumb|220px|left|L to R: [[Bob Dylan]], [[Joan Baez]], and Santana in Hamburg, May 1984]]\nGrowing weary of trying to appease record company executives with formulaic hit records, Santana took great pleasure in jamming and making guest appearances with notables such as the jazz fusion group [[Weather Report]], jazz pianist [[McCoy Tyner]], Blues legend [[John Lee Hooker]], Frank Franklin, [[Living Colour]] guitarist [[Vernon Reid]], and West African singer [[Salif Keita]]. He and [[Mickey Hart]] of the [[Grateful Dead]] later recorded and performed with [[Nigeria]]n drummer [[Babatunde Olatunji]], who conceived one of Santana's famous 1960s drum jams, \"[[Drums of Passion (album)#.22Jin-Go-Lo-Ba.22|Jingo]]\". In 1988 Santana organized a reunion with past members from the Santana band for a series of concert dates. CBS records released a 20-year retrospective of the band's accomplishments with ''[[Viva Santana!]]''.\n\nThat same year Santana formed an all-instrumental group featuring jazz legend [[Wayne Shorter]] on tenor and soprano saxophone. The group also included [[Patrice Rushen]] on keyboards, [[Alphonso Johnson]] on bass, [[Armando Peraza]] and Chepito Areas on percussion, and [[Leon \"Ndugu\" Chancler]] on drums. They toured briefly and received much acclaim from the music press, who compared the effort with the era of ''Caravanserai''.  Santana released another solo record, ''[[Blues for Salvador]]'', which won a [[Grammy Award for Best Rock Instrumental Performance]].\n\nIn 1990 Santana left Columbia Records after twenty-two years and signed with [[Polygram Records|Polygram]]. The following year he made a guest appearance on [[Ottmar Liebert]]'s album, ''Solo Para Ti'', on the songs \"Reaching out 2 U\" and on a cover of his own song, \"Samba Pa Ti\". In 1992\nSantana hired [[jam band]] [[Phish]] as his opening act.\n\n===Return to commercial success===\n[[Image:Carlos Santana crop right.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Santana performing in 2000]]\nSantana kicked off the 1990s with a new album ''[[Spirits Dancing in the Flesh]]'' in 1990. This was followed by ''[[Milagro (Santana album)|Milagro]]'' in 1992, a live album ''[[Sacred Fire: Live in South America|Sacred Fire]]'' in 1993 and ''[[Santana Brothers|Brothers]]'' (a collaboration with his brother Jorge and nephew Carlos Hernandez) in 1994. But sales were relatively poor. Santana toured widely over the next few years but there were no further new album releases, and eventually he was even without a recording contract. However, [[Arista Records]]' [[Clive Davis]], who had worked with Santana at [[Columbia Records]], signed him and encouraged him to record a star-studded album with mostly younger artists. The result was 1999's ''[[Supernatural (Santana album)|Supernatural]]'', which included collaborations with [[Everlast (musician)|Everlast]], [[Rob Thomas (musician)|Rob Thomas]] of [[Matchbox Twenty]], [[Eric Clapton]], [[Lauryn Hill]], [[Wyclef Jean]], [[Cee Lo Green]], [[Man\u00e1]], [[Dave Matthews]], [[K. C. Porter]], [[J. B. Eckl]], and others.\n\nHowever, the lead single was what grabbed the attention of both fans and the music industry. \"[[Smooth (song)|Smooth]]\", a dynamic [[cha-cha-cha (music)|cha-cha]] stop-start number co-written and sung by [[Rob Thomas (musician)|Rob Thomas]] of [[Matchbox Twenty]], was laced throughout with Santana's [[fill (music)|guitar fills]] and runs. The track's energy was immediately apparent on radio, and it was played on a wide variety of station formats. \"Smooth\" spent twelve weeks at number one on the Billboard Hot 100, becoming in the process the last #1 single of the 1990s. The music video, set on a hot [[barrio]] street, was also very popular. ''Supernatural'' reached number one on the US album charts and the follow-up single, \"[[Maria Maria]]\", featuring the [[R&B]] duo [[The Product G&B]], also hit number one, spending ten weeks there in the spring of 2000. ''Supernatural'' eventually sold over 15 million copies in the United States, making it Santana's biggest sales success by far.\n\nCarlos Santana, alongside the classic ''Santana'' lineup of their first two albums, was inducted as an individual, into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 1998. He performed \"Black Magic Woman\" with the writer of the song, Fleetwood Mac's founder [[Peter Green (musician)|Peter Green]]. Green was inducted the same night.\n\nIn 2000 ''Supernatural'' won nine [[Grammy Award]]s (eight for Santana personally), including [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year|Album of the Year]], [[Grammy Award for Record of the Year|Record of the Year]] for \"Smooth\", and [[Grammy Award for Song of the Year|Song of the Year]] for Thomas and [[Itaal Shur]]. Santana's acceptance speeches described his feelings about music's place in one's spiritual existence. Later that year at the [[Latin Grammy Awards]] he won three awards including [[Latin Grammy Award for Record of the Year|Record of the Year]]. In 2001, Santana's guitar skills were featured in [[Michael Jackson]]'s song \"Whatever Happens\", from the album ''[[Invincible (Michael Jackson album)|Invincible]]''.\n\nIn 2002, Santana released ''[[Shaman (album)|Shaman]]'', revisiting the ''Supernatural'' format of guest artists including [[P.O.D.]] and [[Seal (musician)|Seal]]. Although the album was not the runaway success its predecessor had been, it produced two radio-friendly hits. \"[[The Game of Love (song)|The Game of Love]]\" featuring [[Michelle Branch]], rose to number five on the [[Billboard Hot 100]] and spent many weeks at the top of the Billboard Adult Contemporary chart, and \"[[Why Don't You & I]]\" written by and featuring [[Chad Kroeger]] from the group [[Nickelback]] (the original and a remix with [[Alex Band]] from the group [[The Calling]] were combined towards chart performance) which reached number eight on the Billboard Hot 100. \"The Game of Love\" went on to win the [[Grammy Award for Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals]].\n\nIn early August 2003, Santana was named fifteenth on ''Rolling Stone'' magazine's list of the \"100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time\".\n\nOn April 21, 2005, Santana was honored as a [[Broadcast Music Incorporated|BMI]] Icon at the 12th annual BMI Latin Awards.  Santana was the first songwriter designated a BMI Icon at the company's Latin Awards. The honor is given to a creator who has been \"a unique and indelible influence on generations of music makers.\" <ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.bmi.com/news/entry/234386 |title=Artists Announced for Tribute to Carlos Santana at BMI Latin Awards in Las Vegas|publisher=bmi.com|accessdate=2010-09-15}}</ref>\n[[Image:Carlos Santana 2005.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Carlos Santana during a concert in 2005]]\n\nIn 2005, [[Herbie Hancock]] approached Santana to collaborate on an album again using the  ''Supernatural'' formula. ''[[Possibilities (album)|Possibilities]]'' was released on August 30, 2005, featuring Carlos Santana and [[Ang\u00e9lique Kidjo]] on \"Safiatou\". Also, in 2005, fellow Latin star [[Shakira]] invited Santana to play the [[soft rock]] guitar ballad \"[[Illegal (song)|Illegal]]\" on her second English-language studio album ''[[Oral Fixation Vol. 2]]''.\n\nSantana's 2005 album ''[[All That I Am (Santana album)|All That I Am]]'' consists primarily of collaborations with other artists; the first single, the peppy \"[[I'm Feeling You]]\", was again with [[Michelle Branch]] and [[The Wreckers]]. Other musicians joining the mix this time included [[Steven Tyler]] of [[Aerosmith]], [[Kirk Hammett]] from [[Metallica]], hip-hop/reggae star [[Sean Paul]] and R&B singer [[Joss Stone]]. In April and May 2006, Santana toured Europe, where he promoted his son [[Salvador Santana]]'s band as his opening act.\n\nIn 2007, Santana appeared, along with [[Sheila E.]] and [[Jos\u00e9 Feliciano]], on [[Gloria Estefan]]'s album ''[[90 Millas]],'' on the single \"[[No Llores]]\". He also teamed again with Chad Kroeger for the hit single \"[[Into the Night (Santana song)|Into the Night]]\".\n\nIn 2008, Santana was reported to be working with his longtime friend, Marcelo Vieira, on his solo album ''Acoustic Demos'', which was released at the end of the year. It features tracks such as \"For Flavia\" and \"Across the Grave\", the latter said to feature heavy melodic riffs by Santana.\n\nCarlos Santana performed at the 2009 [[American Idol]] Finale with the top 13 finalists, which starred many acts such as KISS, Queen and Rod Stewart. On July 8, 2009, Carlos Santana appeared at the [[Athens Olympic Stadium]] in Athens with his 10-member all-star band as part of his \"Supernatural Santana \u2013 A Trip through the Hits\" European tour. On July 10, 2009, he also appeared at [[Philip II Arena|Philip II Stadium]] in [[Skopje]], [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]]. With a 2.5 hour long concert and 20 000 people, Santana appeared for the first time in that region. \"Supernatural Santana \u2013 A Trip through the Hits\" was played at The Hard Rock hotel in Las Vegas, where it was played through 2011.\n\nSantana is featured as a playable character in the music video game [[Guitar Hero 5]]. A live recording of his song \"No One To Depend On\" is included in game, which was released on September 1, 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.idiomag.com/peek/92605/carlos_santana|title=Carlos Santana Grooves in Guitar Hero 5, which included the song black magic woman|accessdate=2009-07-24|date=2009-07-21|publisher=[[idiomag]]}}</ref> More recently, in 2011, three Santana songs were offered as downloadable content (DLC) for guitar learning software [[Rocksmith]]: \"Oye Como Va,\" \"Smooth,\" and \"Black Magic Woman/Gypsy Queen.\"\n\nCarlos recently opened a chain of upscale [[Mexican cuisine|Mexican restaurants]] called \"Maria Maria\".

King]], Javier B\u00e1tiz, and [[John Lee Hooker]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nndb.com/people/555/000022489/ |title=Carlos Santana |publisher=Nndb.com |accessdate=2010-03-13}}</ref> [[G\u00e1bor Szab\u00f3]]'s mid-1960s jazz/gypsy guitar work also strongly influenced Santana's playing. Indeed, Szab\u00f3's composition \"Gypsy Queen\" was used as the second part of Santana's 1970 treatment of Peter Green's composition \"[[Black Magic Woman]]\", almost down to identical guitar licks. Santana's 2012 instrumental album ''[[Shape Shifter (album)|Shape Shifter]]'' includes a song called \"Mr. Szabo\", played in tribute in the style of G\u00e1bor Szab\u00f3. Santana also credits [[Jimi Hendrix]], [[Mike Bloomfield]], [[Hank Marvin]] and [[Peter Green (musician)|Peter Green]] as important influences; he considered Bloomfield a direct mentor, writing of a key meeting with Bloomfield in San Francisco in the foreword he wrote to a biography of Bloomfield, ''Michael Bloomfield: If You Love These Blues-An Oral History'' in 2000.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dougpayne.com/carlos.htm |title=Carlos Santana Influences |publisher=Dougpayne.com |date=1977-04-23 |accessdate=2010-03-13}}</ref>\n\n==Equipment==\n\n===Guitars and effects===\n[[File:Yamaha SG2000 Devadip, Carlos Santana.png|thumb|65px|Santana's Yamaha SG2000 Devadip  (1976, with inlay) on exhibit in the [[Berlin Musical Instrument Museum]]]]\nSantana played a red Gibson SG Special with P-90 pickups at the Woodstock festival. During the time between the release of Abraxas and Santana III (1970\u20131972), he used different Gibson Les Pauls and a Black Gibson SG Special. From 1976 until 1982 his main guitar was a Yamaha SG 175B, and sometimes a white Gibson SG Custom with 3 single coil pick-ups. In 1982 he started to use a custom made PRS Custom 24 guitar. In 1988 [[PRS Guitars]] began making Santana signature model guitars, which Santana has played through its various iterations ever since (see below).\n\nSantana currently uses a Santana II model guitar fitted with PRS Santana III nickel covered pickups, a tremolo bar, and .009-.042 gauge [[D'Addario]] strings. He also plays a PRS Santana Multidimensional (MD)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://santana.com/musicianscorner/guitars/blue.html |title=Santana \u2013 Musician's Corner \u2013 Blue Guitar |publisher=Santana.com |accessdate=2010-03-13}}</ref>\nThe Santana guitars feature necks made of a single piece of mahogany topped with Rosewood fretboards (some feature highly sought-after [[Brazil]]ian [[Rosewood]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://santana.com/musicianscorner/guitars/red.html |title=Santana \u2013 Musician's Corner \u2013 Red Guitar |publisher=Santana.com |accessdate=2010-03-13}}</ref>).

His PRS guitar is connected to a [[Mu-Tron]] [[wah wah pedal]] (or, more recently, a Dunlop 535Q wah<ref>[http://www.guitarplayer.com/story.asp?storycode=8531 guitarplayer.com]</ref> and a [[T-Rex Engineering|T-Rex]] Replica [[Delay (audio effect)|delay pedal]].<ref>His rig can be seen in a magazine article cited at [http://t-rex-engineering.com/default.asp?show=page&id=2363 T-Rex's website]</ref><ref>[http://www.guitarplayer.com/story.asp?storycode=8531 \"Carlos Santana Spreads the Gospel of Tone\"] by Darrin Fox, Guitar Player Magazine, June edition 2005.</ref> then through a customized [[Jim Dunlop]] amp switcher which in turn is connected to the different amps or cabinets.\n\nPrevious setups include an [[Ibanez Tube Screamer]]<ref>[http://www.santana.com/musicianscorner/layout/index.html Overview of Santana's old effects setup].</ref> right after the guitar.\nHe is also to have been known to use an [[Electro Harmonix]] [[Big Muff]] distortion for his famous sustain. In the song \"Stand Up\" from the album ''[[Marathon (Santana album)|Marathon]]'', Santana uses a Heil [[talk box]] in the guitar solo. He has also used the Audiotech Guitar Products 1x6 Rack Mount Audio Switcher in rehearsals for the 2008 \"Live Your Light\" tour.\n\nSantana uses two different guitar picks: the large triangular Dunlop he has used for so many years, and the [[V-Picks Guitar Picks|V-Pick]] Freakishly Large Round.\n\n===Amplifiers===\nCarlos Santana's distinctive guitar tone is produced by PRS Santana signature guitars plugged into multiple amplifiers. The amps consist of a [[Mesa Boogie]] Mark I, Dumble [[Distortion (music)|Overdrive]] Reverb and more recently a Bludotone amplifier. Santana compares the tonal qualities of each amplifier to that of a singer producing head/nasal tones, chest tones, and belly tones. A three-way amp switcher is employed on Carlos's pedal board to enable him to switch between amps. Often the unique tones of each amplifier are blended together, complementing each other producing a richer tone.\n\nHe also put the \"Boogie\" in Mesa Boogie. Santana is credited with coining the popular Mesa amplifier name when he tried one and exclaimed, \"That little thing really Boogies!\"<ref>[http://www.mesaboogie.com/US/Smith/our_story.html Quote] from Mesa Boogie web site</ref>\n\nSpecifically, Santana combines a Mesa/Boogie Mark I head running through a Boogie cabinet with [[Altec]] 417-8H (or recently [[JBL]] E120s) speakers, and a [[Dumble]] Overdrive Reverb and/or a Dumble Overdrive Special running through a Brown or [[Marshall Amplification|Marshall]] 4x12 cabinet with [[Celestion]] G12M \"Greenback\" speakers, depending on the desired sound. [[Shure]] KSM-32 microphones are used to pick up the sound, going to the [[Public address|PA]]. Additionally, a [[Fender Musical Instruments Corporation|Fender]] Cyber-Twin Amp is mostly used at home.\n\nDuring his early career Santana used a GMT transistor amplifier stack and a silverface Fender Twin. The GMT 226A rig was used at the Woodstock concert as well as during recording Santana's debut album. During this era Santana had also began to use the Fender Twin, which was also used on the debut and proceedingly at the recording sessions of Abraxas.\n\n==Personal life==\nCarlos Santana became a naturalized US citizen in 1965.<ref name = natural>{{cite web |url=http://learn.pacificcoastimmigration.org/notable/profiles/csantana.html |title=Welcome to the Pacific Coast Immigration Museum |publisher=learn.pacificcoastimmigration.org |accessdate=2010-10-19 }}</ref>\n\nOn October 19, 2007, his wife of 34 years, Deborah Santana, filed for divorce citing \"irreconcilable differences\".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE66B6QG20100712 |title=Carlos Santana proposes onstage to girlfriend |author=Dean Goodman |date=July 12, 2010 |agency=Reuters   |accessdate=November 8, 2010}}</ref>\n\nCarlos Santana became engaged to drummer [[Cindy Blackman]], after proposing to her during a concert of the Universal Tone Tour at Tinley Park in Chicago, Illinois on July 9, 2010.
