He is best noted for the tracks \"Blues At Midnight\" and \"I'm Gonna Walk Your Log\".<ref name=\"Dead\"/>\n\n== Life and career ==\nLeonard Caston Sr. was born in [[Sumrall, Mississippi]], [[United States]],<ref name=\"Dead\"/> and raised in [[Meadville, Mississippi]] from age eight. He lived in [[Chicago]] from 1934 to 1936 but then moved back to Mississippi after his family relocated to [[Natchez, Mississippi|Natchez]]. He learned to play piano under the influence of [[Leroy Carr]] and [[Art Tatum]]; he has also credited [[Andy Kirk (musician)|Andy Kirk]] and [[Jimmy Rogers]], as well as his relative [[Kim Weathersby]], as stylistic influences.\n\nIn 1938 he returned to Chicago, where he met with [[Mayo Williams]], a [[record producer|producer]] for [[Decca Records]]. Williams recorded him in a trio with [[Eugene Gilmore]] and [[Arthur Dixon (musician)|Arthur Dixon]]; Dixon introduced him to his brother, [[Willie Dixon]]. Willie and Caston then formed the Five Breezes, along with [[Jimmy Gilmore]], [[Joe Bell]], and [[Willie Hawthorne]], a group in the style of [[The Ink Spots]]. In 1940, Caston recorded his first solo record for Decca, \"The Death of Walter Barnes\", which also included [[Robert Nighthawk]] on [[harmonica]].\n\nThe Five Breezes disbanded in 1941, and Caston began playing in the Rhythm Rascals Trio with [[Alfred Elkins]] and [[Ollie Crawford]]. The group did [[USO]] tours, and in 1945 performed at a conference for [[Dwight Eisenhower]], [[Bernard Montgomery]], and [[Georgy Zhukov]]. After the war, he recorded under his own name as well as for [[Roosevelt Sykes]] and [[Walter Davis]], and did myriad studio sessions. He also recorded again with Dixon as the Four Jumps of Jive and the Big Three Trio, playing in both groups with [[Bernardo Dennis]] as well. Ollie Crawford joined this group soon after Dennis's departure. The Big Three Trio recorded for [[Columbia Records]] and [[Okeh Records]].\n\nThe Big Three Trio's last sides were recorded in 1952, but the group did not officially break up until 1956. Caston continued performing for decades afterwards, returning to perform with Dixon in 1984.\n\nCaston also released an album, ''Baby Doo's House Party'', shortly before his death of [[heart disease]] in [[Minneapolis]], [[Minnesota]], in 1987.<ref name=\"Dead\"/>\n\nHis son, [[Leonard Caston, Jr.]], is an [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]] singer and songwriter who sang with [[The Radiants]] among other endeavors.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n*Bruce Eder, [{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p63195/biography|pure_url=yes}} Leonard Caston] at [[Allmusic]]\n\n{{Authority control|VIAF=17411216}}\n{{Persondata <!-- Metadata: see [[Wikipedia:Persondata]]. -->\n| NAME              = Caston, Leonard\n| ALTERNATIVE NAMES =\n| SHORT DESCRIPTION = [[United States|American]] blues pianist and guitarist\n| DATE OF BIRTH     = June 2, 1917\n| PLACE OF BIRTH    = [[Sumrall, Mississippi]], [[United States]]\n| DATE OF DEATH     = August 22, 1987\n| PLACE OF DEATH    = [[Minneapolis]], [[Minnesota]], United States\n}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Caston, Leonard}}\n[[Category:1917 births]]\n[[Category:1987 deaths]]\n[[Category:American blues guitarists]]\n[[Category:American blues pianists]]\n[[Category:Cardiovascular disease deaths in Minnesota]]\n[[Category:Musicians from Mississippi]]\n[[Category:People from Franklin County, Mississippi]]\n[[Category:People from Lamar County, Mississippi]]"}]}}}}
