J. Brooks, who abandoned the family not long after Robert's birth. Robert later acquired the name \"Bland\" from his stepfather, Leroy Bridgeforth, who was also called Leroy Bland.<ref name=NYTobit/> Bobby Bland never went to school, and remained illiterate throughout his life.<ref name=telegraph>{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/10139852/Bobby-Bland.html |title=Bobby Bland |newspaper=The Telegraph|date=June 24, 2013}}. Retrieved 26 June 2013</ref>\n\nAfter moving to [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]] with his mother in 1947, Bland started singing with local [[Gospel music|gospel]] groups there, including amongst others The Miniatures. Eager to expand his interests, he began frequenting the city's famous [[Beale Street]] where he became associated with an ad hoc circle of aspiring musicians including [[B.B. King]], [[Rosco Gordon]], [[Junior Parker]] and [[Johnny Ace]], who collectively took the name of the Beale Streeters.<ref name=Livinblues /><ref name=guardian>{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2013/jun/24/bobby-blue-bland |title=Bobby 'Blue' Bland obituary |newspaper=The Guardian|date=June 24, 2013 |first=Tony |last=Russell}}. Retrieved 26 June 2013</ref><ref name=bobbybluebland>[http://www.bobbybluebland.com/  Biography at BobbyBlueBland.com]. Retrieved 26 June 2013</ref>\n\n===Early career===\nBetween 1950 and 1952, he recorded unsuccessful singles for [[Modern Records]] and, at [[Ike Turner]]'s suggestion, for [[Sun Records]] &mdash; who licensed their recordings to the [[Chess Records|Chess]] label &mdash; before signing for [[Duke Records]].<ref name=telegraph/>  Bland's recordings from the early 1950s show him striving for individuality, but any progress was halted by a two year spell in the [[U.S. Army]], during which time he performed in a band with singer [[Eddie Fisher (singer)|Eddie Fisher]].<ref>{{cite web | title = Bobby Blue Bland: November 1973 interview | publisher = SoulMusic.com| url = http://www.soulmusic.com/index.asp?S=1&T=38&ART=2919| accessdate = 2013-06-28}}</ref>\n\nWhen Bland returned to Memphis in 1954 he found several of his former associates, including Johnny Ace, enjoying considerable success.  He joined Ace's revue, and returned to Duke Records, which by that time had started to be run by [[Houston]] entrepreneur [[Don Robey]].  According to biographer Charles Farley, \"Robey handed Bobby a new contract, which Bobby could not read, and helped Bobby sign his name on it\".  The deal gave Bland just half a cent per record sold, instead of the industry standard of 2 cents.<ref name=telegraph/>\n\nBland released his first single for Duke in 1955.<ref name=bobbybluebland/>  In 1956 he began touring on the \"[[chitlin' circuit]]\" with Junior Parker in a revue called Blues Consolidated, initially doubling as Parker's valet and driver, roles he also reportedly fulfilled for B.B. King and Rosco Gordon.<ref>\n{{cite web\n  | title = Bobby Blue Bland\n  | publisher = Pbase, soulful impressions\n  | url = http://www.pbase.com/soulfulimpressions/bobby_bland\n  | accessdate = 2007-08-09\n}}</ref>  He began recording for Duke with bandleader Bill Harvey and arranger Joe Scott, asserting his characteristic vocal style and, with Harvey and Scott, beginning to craft the melodic big band blues singles for which he became famous, often accompanied by guitarist [[Wayne Bennett (blues guitarist)|Wayne Bennett]].<ref name=telegraph/>  Unlike many blues musicians, Bland played no instrument.<ref name=\"bbc obit\"/>\n\n===Commercial success===\nHis first chart success came in 1957 with the [[R&B chart]] no. 1 hit \"[[Farther Up the Road]]\", which also reached no.43 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot 100]], and followed it up with a series of hits on the R&B chart including \"Little Boy Blue\" (1958).<ref name=\"whitburnr&b\"/>  He also shared an album with Parker, ''Blues Consolidated'', in 1958.<ref name=guardian/> Bland's craft was most clearly heard on a series of early 1960s releases including \"Cry Cry Cry\", \"[[I Pity The Fool]]\" &mdash; an R&B chart no.1 in 1961 &mdash; and \"[[Turn On Your Love Light]]\", which became a much-covered standard. Despite credits to the contrary &mdash; often claimed by Robey&mdash; many such classic works were written by Joe Scott.<ref name=Livinblues />  Bland also recorded a hit version of [[T-Bone Walker]]'s \"[[Call It Stormy Monday (But Tuesday Is Just as Bad)]]\", which was wrongly given the title of a different song, \"[[Stormy Monday Blues]]\".<ref name=guardian/>\n\nHis final R&B No.1 came with \"[[That's the Way Love Is (Bobby Bland song)|That's The Way Love Is]]\" in 1963.<ref name=\"whitburnr&b\"/>  However, he continued to enjoy a consistent run of R&B chart entries throughout the mid-1960s. Never truly breaking into the mainstream market, Bland's highest charting song on the pop chart, \"Ain't Nothing You Can Do\" peaked at #20 in the same week in 1964 that [[the Beatles]] held down the top five spots. Bland's records mostly sold on the R&B market rather than achieving [[Crossover (music)|crossover]] success. He had 23 Top Ten hits on the [[Billboard R&B chart]]s, and in the 1996 Top R&B book by [[Joel Whitburn]], Bland was ranked the #13 all-time top charting artist.<ref name=\"whitburnr&b\"/>\n\n===Later career===\nFinancial pressures forced the singer to cut his touring band and in 1968 the group broke up. He suffered from [[Depression (mood)|depression]] and became increasingly dependent on alcohol,<ref name=Livinblues/> but stopped drinking in 1971.  His record company Duke Records was sold by owner Don Robey to the larger [[ABC Records]] group. This resulted in several successful and critically acclaimed contemporary blues/soul albums including ''His California Album'' and ''Dreamer'', arranged by [[Michael Omartian]] and produced by ABC staff man [[Steve Barri]]. The albums, including the later \"follow-up\" in 1977 ''Reflections in Blue'', were all recorded in Los Angeles and featured many of the city's top session musicians at the time.\n\nThe first single released from ''His California Album'', \"This Time I'm Gone For Good\" took Bland back into the pop Top 50 for the first time since 1964 and made the R&B top 10 in late 1973. The lead-off track from ''Dreamer'', \"[[Ain't No Love In the Heart of the City]]\", was a strong R&B hit. Later it would surface again in 1978 by the hard rock band [[Whitesnake]] featuring singer [[David Coverdale]]. Much later it was sampled by [[Kanye West]] on [[Jay-Z]]'s hip hop album ''[[The Blueprint]]'' (2001). The song is also featured on the soundtrack of the crime drama ''[[The Lincoln Lawyer (film)|The Lincoln Lawyer]]'' (2011) starring [[Matthew McConaughey]].<ref name=blogs.indiewire.com>{{cite web | title=The Lincoln Lawyer (Soundtrack) | publisher=blogs.indiewire.com | url=http://blogs.indiewire.com/theplaylist/archives/the_lincoln_lawyer_soundtrack_features_erik_b._rakim_gang_starr_deadmau5_mo/ | accessdate=2011-03-24}}</ref> The follow-up, \"I Wouldn't Treat A Dog\" was his biggest R&B hit for some years, climbing to #3 in late 1974, but as usual his strength was never the pop chart (where it hit #88). Subsequent attempts at adding a [[disco]]/[[Barry White]] flavor were mostly unsuccessful. A return to his roots in 1980 for a [[tribute album]] to his mentor Joe Scott, produced by music veterans Monk Higgins and [[Al Bell]], resulted in the album ''Sweet Vibrations'', but it failed to sell well outside of his traditional \"[[chitlin circuit]]\" base.\n\nIn 1985, Bland was signed by [[Malaco Records]], specialists in traditional Southern black music for whom he made a series of albums while continuing to tour and appear at concerts with fellow blues singer [[B. B. King]]. The two had collaborated for two albums in the 1970s. Despite occasional age-related ill health, Bland continued to record new albums for Malaco and perform occasional tours alone, with guitarist/producer [[Angelo Earl]] and also with B.B. King, plus appearances at blues and soul festivals worldwide. Bland was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 1992. The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame described him as \"second in stature only to B. B. King as a product of Memphis's Beale Street blues scene\".<ref name=\"bbc obit\"/>\n\n===Collaborations and tributes===\nThe Irish singer-songwriter [[Van Morrison]] was an early adherent of Bland, covering \"Turn On Your Love Light\" while with the band [[Them (band)|Them]] (he later covered \"Ain't Nothing You Can't Do\" on his 1974 live album ''[[It's Too Late to Stop Now]]'') and has on occasion had Bland as a guest singer at his concerts. He also included a previously unreleased version of a March 2000 duet of Morrison and Bland singing \"[[Tupelo Honey (Van Morrison song)|Tupelo Honey]]\" on his 2007 compilation album, ''[[The Best of Van Morrison Volume 3]]''.\n\nIn 2008 the British singer and lead vocalist of [[Simply Red]], [[Mick Hucknall]], released an album, ''[[Tribute to Bobby]]'', containing songs associated with Bland. The album reached 18 in the [[UK Albums Chart]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/music/reviews/5h54 | title=Mick Hucknall Tribute To Bobby Review | publisher=BBC | accessdate=2013-06-24}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.officialcharts.com/artist/_/simply%20red/ | title=UK Official Charts - Simply Red | publisher=www.officialcharts.com | accessdate=2013-06-24}}</ref>\n\n===Death===\nBland continued performing until shortly before his death. He died on June 23, 2013, at his home in [[Germantown, Tennessee]], a suburb of [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]], after what family members described as \"an ongoing illness\". He was 83.<ref name=NYTobit>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/25/arts/music/bobby-blue-bland-soul-and-blues-balladeer-dies-at-83.html |title=Bobby (Blue) Bland, Soul and Blues Balladeer, Dies at 83 |newspaper=New York Times|date=June 24, 2013 |first=Bill |last=Friskics-Warren}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Marshall|first=Matt|title=BREAKING: Bobby \"Blue\" Bland Passes Away|url=http://www.americanbluesscene.com/2013/06/bobby-blue-bland/|accessdate=25 June 2013|newspaper=American Blues Scene Magazine|date=23 June 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Adrian Sainz, The Associated Press |url=http://www.windsorstar.com/entertainment/Singer+Bobby+Blue+Bland+dies+known+Further+Road+Turn+Your+Love/8568124/story.html |title=Bobby 'Blue' Bland, known for 'Further On Up the Road' and 'Turn on Your Love Light,' dies |publisher=Windsorstar.com |date=1992-01-15 |accessdate=2013-06-24}}{{dead link|date=March 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://wreg.com/013/06/23/blues-legend-bobby-blue-bland-dies/|title=Blues legend Bobby \"Blue\" Bland dies|publisher=[[WREG-TV]]|accessdate=2013-06-24}}</ref> After his death, his son told news media that Bland had recently discovered that musician [[James Cotton]] was his half-brother.<ref name=NYTobit/>\n\n==Discography==\n\n===Studio albums===\n*''[[Two Steps from the Blues]]'' (Duke 1961/MCA 2002)\n*''[[Here's the Man!]]'' - 1962 (Duke Records)\n*''Call On Me/That's The Way Love Is'' - 1963 (Duke Records)\n*''Ain't Nothing You Can Do'' - 1964 (Duke Records)\n*''The Soul of The Man'' - 1966 (Duke Records)\n*''Touch of The Blues'' - 1967 (Duke Records)\n*''Spotlighting The Man'' - 1969 (Duke Records)\n*''His California Album'' - 1973 (Dunhill Records)\n*''Dreamer'' - 1974 (Dunhill Records)\n*''Get On Down'' - 1975 (ABC Records)\n*''Reflections In Blue'' - 1977 (ABC Records)\n*''Come Fly With Me'' - 1978  (ABC Records)\n*''I Feel Good, I Feel Fine'' - 1979  ([[MCA Records]])\n*''Sweet Vibrations'' - 1980 (MCA 27076) (tribute to [[Joe Scott]])\n*''Try Me, I'm Real'' - 1981 (MCA 5233)\n*''Here We Go Again'' - 1982 (MCA 5297)\n*''Tell Mr Bland'' - 1983 (MCA 5425)\n*''You've Got Me Loving You'' - 1984 (MCA 52436)\n*''Members Only'' - 1985  ([[Malaco Records]])\n*''After All'' - 1986  (Malaco Records)\n*''Blues You Can Use'' - 1987 (Malaco Records)\n*''Midnight Run'' - 1989 (Malaco Records)\n*''Portrait of the Blues'' - 1991 (Malaco Records)\n*''Years of Tears'' - 1993 (Malaco Records)\n*''Sad Street'' - 1995 (Malaco Records)\n*''Memphis Monday Morning'' - 1998 (Malaco Records)\n*''Blues At Midnight'' - 2003 (Malaco Records)\n\n===Live albums===\n*''[[Together for the First Time]]'' (with B.B.
