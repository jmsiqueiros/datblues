His father, James Coleman, was from [[Banada]] in County Roscommon, and a respected [[flute]] player. Michael was the seventh child of James and Beatrice, and the surviving half of a pair of twins.\n\nAs a child he learned [[step dancing]] and [[fiddle]] playing, and performed at local houses. His elder brother Jim had a high reputation but was never recorded. In his formative years Michael was influenced by [[Uilleann]] pipers (a type of [[bagpipe]]), including [[Johnny Gorman (musician)|Johnny Gorman]].\n\nHe left school in 1908, at the age of 17. He competed at the Sligo Feis Ceoil in 1909 and again in 1910, and was placed joint third on both occasions. In 1914 he moved to [[Manchester, England]] to live with his older brother Pat, but returned home after several months.\n\n==Emigration to the United States==\nIn October 1914, at the age of twenty-three, Coleman sailed to [[United States|America]] with his friend [[John Hunt]]. Initially he stayed with his aunt in [[Lowell, Massachusetts]] and joined the [[Keith Theatres]] [[vaudeville]] circuit playing the fiddle while dancing at the same time. In 1917, he settled in [[New York City]], and married Marie Fanning, originally from County [[Monaghan]], Ireland. They had one child, Mary.\n\nBetween 1921 and 1936 he recorded roughly eighty 78-[[rpm]] [[gramophone record|record]]s for many [[record label]]s, including: Shannon, [[Vocalion Records]], [[Columbia Records]], [[Okeh Records]], New Republic, Pathe, O'Beirne de Witt, [[Victor Talking Machine Company|Victor Records]], [[Brunswick Records]], and [[Decca Records]]. Some of these were re-issued under the Intrepid, [[Coral Records]], and Ace of Hearts labels. He was mainly accompanied by [[pianist]]s, but on some recordings he used [[guitarist]]s.\n\nColeman was one of the most famous exponents of what is today known as [[the Sligo style]]. The Sligo fiddle style is fast and flamboyant, and heavily ornamented with rolls and triplets. [[James Morrison (fiddler)|James Morrison]] is another exponent of this style, although there are some noticeable differences. Coleman in particular used variations to enhance the melody of the tune, and his settings of tunes such as Boys of the Lough, Bonny Kate, and Lord Gordon's have become part of the standard repertoire. Michael's records reached County Sligo, and influenced a new generation. He died in [[New York City]], and is buried in St. Raymond's Cemetery, in the [[Bronx]].\n\n==Legacy==\nColeman's influence on traditional fiddle playing is substantial. Every generation since has been influenced by his recordings either directly or indirectly. Most notably, he has influenced fiddle players such as Andy McGann, John Carty, Martin Byrnes and many others.\n\nIn 1974, a monument was erected by the [[Coleman Traditional Society]]. It is close to his birthplace, on the [[Tubbercurry]] to [[Gurteen]] road. Nearby is the [[Coleman Heritage Centre]], a music archive and a replica of the house where he lived. The monument bears this inscription:\n\n:''\"Michael Coleman. Master of the fiddle. Saviour of Irish traditional music. Born near this spot in 1891. Died in exile 1945.\"''\n\n==Discography==\n* ''Irish Jigs and Reels - Coral LP CRL 57369''\n* ''The Enduring Magic'' (2004)\n* ''Michael Coleman 1889&ndash;1945''\n* (Various Artists) ''Past Masters of Irish Fiddle Music''\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.comhaltas.com/archive/billeog/mcoleman.htm Comhaltas Archive]\n* [http://www.colemanirishmusic.com/ Michael Coleman Heritage Centre]\n\n{{Authority control|VIAF=54283289}}\n\n{{Persondata <!-- Metadata: see [[Wikipedia:Persondata]]. -->\n| NAME              = Coleman, Michael\n| ALTERNATIVE NAMES =\n| SHORT DESCRIPTION = Irish musician\n| DATE OF BIRTH     = January 31, 1891\n| PLACE OF BIRTH    =\n| DATE OF DEATH     = January 4, 1945\n| PLACE OF DEATH    =\n}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Coleman, Michael}}\n[[Category:Irish folk musicians]]\n[[Category:1891 births]]\n[[Category:1945 deaths]]\n[[Category:Irish fiddlers]]\n[[Category:Musicians from County Sligo]]\n[[Category:Vaudeville performers]]\n[[Category:Date of birth missing]]"}]}}}}
