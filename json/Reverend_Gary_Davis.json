His [[Fingerstyle guitar|finger-picking]] guitar style influenced many other artists and his students in [[New York City|New York]] included [[Stefan Grossman]], [[David Bromberg]], [[Roy Book Binder]], [[Larry Johnson (musician)|Larry Johnson]], [[Woody Mann]], [[Nick Katzman]], [[Dave Van Ronk]], [[Tom Winslow]], [[Rory Block]], and [[Ernie Hawkins]].<ref name=\"russell\">{{cite book\n| first= Tony\n| last= Russell\n| year= 1997\n| title= The Blues - From Robert Johnson to Robert Cray\n| edition= \n| publisher=Carlton Books Limited \n| location= Dubai\n| page= 105\n| isbn= 1-85868-255-X}}</ref> \n\nHe has influenced [[Bob Dylan]], [[Grateful Dead]], [[Jackson Browne]], [[Townes van Zandt]], [[Dave Van Ronk]], [[Wizz Jones]], [[Jorma Kaukonen]], [[Keb' Mo']], [[Ollabelle]], [[Godspeed You Black Emperor!]], [[Resurrection Band]], and [[John Sebastian]] of [[The Lovin' Spoonful]].\n\n==Biography==\nGary Davis was born in [[Laurens, South Carolina|Laurens]], [[South Carolina]], and was the only one of eight children his mother bore who survived to adulthood. He became blind as an infant. Davis reported that his father was killed in [[Birmingham, Alabama]], when Davis was ten, and Davis later said that he had been told that his father had been shot by the Birmingham [[High Sheriff]]. He recalled being poorly treated by his mother and that before his death his father had given him into the care of his paternal grandmother.<ref>[http://www.arbiterrecords.com/notes/2008notes.html ]{{dead link|date=May 2014}}</ref> \n\nHe took to the guitar and assumed a unique multi-voice style produced solely with his thumb and index finger, playing not only [[ragtime]] and blues tunes, but also traditional and original tunes in four-part harmony.\n[[File:Bullcityblues.jpg|thumb|left||Bull City Blues, [[Durham, North Carolina|Durham]], [[North Carolina]]]]\nIn the mid-1920s, Davis migrated to [[Durham, North Carolina|Durham]], [[North Carolina]], a major center for [[African American culture|black culture]] at the time. There he collaborated with a number of other [[musician|artists]] in the [[Piedmont blues]] scene including [[Blind Boy Fuller]] and [[Bull City Red]].<ref name=\"russell\"/>  In 1935, [[J. B. Long]], a store manager with a reputation for supporting local artists, introduced Davis, Fuller and Red to the [[American Record Company]].  The subsequent [[sound recording and reproduction|recording]] sessions marked the real beginning of Davis' career.  During his time in Durham, Davis converted to Christianity; in 1937 he would be [[ordination|ordained]] as a [[Baptists|Baptist]] [[minister of religion|minister]].<ref name=\"russell\"/><ref>{{cite AV media notes |title= Meet You at the Station: The Vintage Recordings (1935-1949) | others= Reverend Gary Davis |year= 2003 | origyear = Signed 1991 |first= Chris |last= Smith |publisher= [[Document Records]] |location= United Kingdom | url = http://musicbrainz.org/release/fdee45ea-3fab-440a-986a-c8766ae1ec46/cover-art | accessdate = 2013-02-11 | oclc = 489027245}}</ref>  Following his conversion and especially his ordination, Davis began to express a preference for inspirational gospel music.  \n\nIn the 1940s, the blues scene in Durham began to decline and Davis migrated to New York.<ref name=\"russell\"/> In 1951, well before his 'rediscovery', Davis's oral history was recorded by [[Elizabeth Lyttleton Harold]] (the wife of [[Alan Lomax]]) who transcribed their conversations into a 300+-page typescript.\n\nThe [[Roots revival|folk revival]] of the 1960s re-invigorated Davis' career, culminating in a performance at the [[Newport Folk Festival]] and the recording by [[Peter, Paul and Mary]] of \"[[Samson and Delilah (song)|Samson and Delilah]]\", also known as \"If I Had My Way\", originally a [[Blind Willie Johnson]] recording that Davis had popularized. Blues Hall of Fame singer and harmonica player [[Darrell Mansfield]] has also recorded several of Rev. Davis song's. Bob Dylan famously covered Rev.
