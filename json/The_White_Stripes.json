Jack has stated on numerous occasions that the blues is the dominant influence on his songwriting and the roots of the band's music, stating that he feels it is so sacred that playing it does not do it justice. Of The Gun Club's music in particular, Jack White has said, \"[[Fire of Love|'Sex Beat', 'She's Like Heroin To Me', and 'For The Love Of Ivy']]...why are these songs not taught in schools?\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/music/2007/07/why_the_white_stripes_want_to.html |title=Why the White Stripes want to join the Gun Club |author=Owen Adams |publisher=Guardian Music Blogs |date=July 18, 2007 |accessdate=August 30, 2008 | location=London}}</ref> Heavy [[blues rock]] bands such as the [[Rolling Stones]] and [[AC/DC]] have also influenced the band, particularly [[Led Zeppelin]], as Jack has claimed that he \"can't trust anybody who doesn't like Led Zeppelin.\" <ref>[http://www.mirror.co.uk/celebs/news/2007/11/08/led-zep-celeb-addicts-115875-20079000/ mirror.co.uk]</ref>\n\n[[Country music|Traditional country music]] such as [[Hank Williams]] and [[Loretta Lynn]], [[rockabilly]] acts like the [[Flat Duo Jets]], [[Wanda Jackson]] and [[Gene Vincent]], the [[surf rock]] of [[Dick Dale]], and [[folk music]] like [[Lead Belly]] and [[Bob Dylan]] have also influenced the band's sound.<ref>[http://www.plume-noire.com/music/live/thewhitestripes.html Plume Noir]\"The White Stripes Concert at Manchester\", (accessed June 20, 2008) Thorpe, Greg (April 8, 2003).</ref> Meg White has said one of her all-time favorite musicians is Bob Dylan;<ref>[http://editthis.info/stripespedia/Meg_White Stripespedia] Meg White entry.

He ends the demonstration with the memorable quote, \"Who says you need to buy a guitar?\"\n\n===Instruments and equipment===\n:''Main articles: [[Jack White (musician)#Musical equipment and sound|Jack White's musical equipment]] and [[Meg White#Equipment|Meg White's musical equipment]].''\nThe White Stripes are notable for having only two musicians, limiting the instruments played live.<ref name=FM>Hickman, Christopher (2005).

Also, while playing live, he used an MXR Micro-Amp, Electro-Harmonix [[Big Muff Pi]] distortion/[[sustain]]er, and an Electro-Harmonix POG (a polyphonic octave generator). He also used a Boss TU-2 tuner pedal. He plugged this setup into a 1970s [[Fender Musical Instruments Corporation|Fender]] Twin Reverb, and two 100-Watt [[Sears, Roebuck and Company|Sears]] [[Silvertone (instruments)|Silvertone]] 1485 amplifiers paired with two 6x10 Silvertone cabinets.<ref name=\"bb1\"/> In addition to standard [[guitar tuning]], Jack White also used several [[open tuning]]s.\n\nWhite also played other instruments such as a black F-Style Gibson [[mandolin]], Rhodes bass keys, and a Steinway piano.

I get [criticism] sometimes, and I go through periods where it really bothers me. But then I think about it, and I realize that this is what is really needed for this band. And I just try to have as much fun with it as possible ... I just know the way [Jack] plays so well at this point that I always know kind of what he's going to do. I can always sense where he's going with things just by the mood he's in or the attitude or how the song is going. Once in a while, he throws me for a loop, but I can usually keep him where I want him.\"<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" /></blockquote>\n\nWhile Jack was the lead vocalist, Meg did sing lead vocals on four of the band's songs: \"In the Cold, Cold Night\" (from [[Elephant (album)|''Elephant'']]),<ref name=\"NYT\"/> \"Passive Manipulation\" (from ''[[Get Behind Me Satan]]''), \"Who's a Big Baby?\" (released on the \"[[Blue Orchid]]\" single), and \"St. Andrew (This Battle Is in the Air)\" (from ''[[Icky Thump]]''). She also accompanied Jack on the songs \"Your Southern Can Is Mine\" from their album ''[[De Stijl (album)|De Stijl]]'', \"Hotel Yorba\" and \"This Protector\" from their album ''[[White Blood Cells (album)|White Blood Cells]]'', on \"You Don't Know What Love Is \"(You Just Do as You're Told)\" and \"Rag & Bone\" from their album ''Icky Thump'', \"[[Hotel Yorba|Rated X]]\" and also sang alongside Jack and [[Holly Golightly (singer)|Holly Golightly]] on the song \"It's True That We Love One Another\", from the album ''Elephant''.\n\n===Recording sessions and live performances===\n[[Image:Bigdayout whitestripes.jpg|thumb|The White Stripes playing at the Big Day Out in Melbourne 2006]]\nSeveral White Stripes recordings were completed rapidly. For example, ''Elephant'' was recorded in about two weeks in London's [[Toe Rag Studio]].<ref name=\"amg\"/> Their 2005 follow-up, ''Get Behind Me Satan'', was likewise recorded in just two weeks.\n\nFor live shows, the White Stripes was known for Jack's employment of heavy [[distortion (guitar)|distortion]], as well as [[audio feedback]] and [[overdrive (music)|overdrive]]. The duo performed considerably more recklessly and unstructured live, never preparing [[set list]]s for their shows, believing that planning too closely would ruin the spontaneity of their performances.<ref>Frampton, Scott (July 2007), [http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=afh&AN=25432724&loginpage=Login.asp&site=ehost-live \"Jack & Meg White\"].

Three of these songs, \"The Hardest Button To Button\", \"Aluminium\" and \"Blue Orchid\", were first played to the band as a surprise in Cincinnati Music Hall, Ohio. McGregor heard the orchestral versions and decided to create a ballet using the music. Talbot re-orchestrated the music for the Royal Opera House orchestra, also writing three additional pieces of his own composition. The world premiere of the ballet took place on November 16, 2006 at the [[Royal Opera House]] in [[Covent Garden]], London. The ballet subsequently won the 2007 [[Laurence Olivier Award]] for [[Laurence Olivier Award for Best New Dance Production|Best New Dance Production]].\n\n===Red, White and Black===\n\nThe White Stripes made exclusive use of a red, white and black color scheme when conducting virtually all professional duties, from album art to the clothes worn during live performances:\n\n{{quotation|\n[[Rolling Stone|Rolling Stone Magazine]]: Were red, black and white your favorite colors as a kid?<br /><br />\n[[Jack White (musician)|Jack White]]: After I apprenticed as an upholsterer for a few years, I opened my own shop, Third Man Upholstery. Everything was yellow, black and white. All my power tools were yellow and black. I had a yellow van. I ran my business like a cartoon. I was making out bills in crayon and writing poetry inside people's furniture. I didn't care if I made any money. I was so happy to pull up in front of someone's house wearing a yellow-and-black uniform, with a yellow clipboard. But the White Stripes' colors were always red, white and black. It came from peppermint candy. I also think '''they are the most powerful color combination of all time''', from a Coca-Cola can to a Nazi banner. Those colors strike chords with people. In Japan, they are honorable colors. When you see a bride in a white gown, you immediately see innocence in that. Red is anger and passion. It is also sexual. And black is the absence of all that.\n|Rolling Stone Magazine: September 8, 2005.<ref>[http://www.whitestripes.net/articles-show.php?id=21 ''Rolling Stone'' Magazine: September 8, 2005.
