L.\" Burnside''' (November 23, 1926 \u2013 September 1, 2005) was an American [[blues]] singer, songwriter, and guitarist who lived much of his life in and around [[Holly Springs, Mississippi]]. He played music for much of his life, but did not receive much attention until the early 1990s.<ref name=\"amg\"/> In the latter half of the 1990s, Burnside repeatedly recorded with [[Jon Spencer]], garnering crossover appeal and introducing his music to a new fanbase within the [[underground music|underground]] [[garage rock]] scene.\n\nOne commentator noted that Burnside, [[Big Jack Johnson]], [[Paul \"Wine\" Jones]], [[Roosevelt \"Booba\" Barnes]] and [[Super Chikan|James \"Super Chikan\" Johnson]] were \"present-day exponents of an edgier, electrified version of the raw, uncut Delta blues sound.\"<ref name=\"Music\">{{cite book| first= Paul| last= Du Noyer| year= 2003| title= The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Music| edition= 1st| publisher= Flame Tree Publishing | location= Fulham, London| isbn= 1-904041-96-5| page= 160}}</ref>\n\n==Early life and career==\nBurnside was born in 1926<ref name=\"amg\">{{cite web |url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p33736|pure_url=yes}} |title=R.L.

Burnside learned music largely from [[Mississippi Fred McDowell]], who lived nearby in an adjoining county. He also cited his cousin-in-law, [[Muddy Waters]], as an influence.<ref name=\"amg\"/>\n\nBurnside grew tired of sharecropping and moved to [[Chicago]] in 1944 in the hope of finding better economic opportunities.<ref name = theindep>{{cite news| last=Leigh |first=Spencer |title =R.

Within the span of one year his father, two brothers, and uncle were all murdered in the city, a tragedy that Burnside would later draw upon in his work, particularly in his interpretation of [[Skip James]]'s \"Hard Time Killing Floor\" and the [[talking blues]] \"R.L.'s Story\", the opening and closing tracks on Burnside's 2000 [[album]], ''Wish I Was In Heaven Sitting Down''.\n\nAround 1959, he left Chicago and went back to Mississippi to work the farms and raise a family. He killed a man at a dice game and was convicted of [[murder]] and sentenced to six months' [[incarceration]] (in [[Mississippi State Penitentiary|Parchman Prison]]).<ref name=\"Jay\">McInerney, Jay. \"White Man at the Door: One Man's Mission to Record the 'Dirty Blues' - before Everyone Dies.\" ''[[The New Yorker]]'' (February 4, 2002): page 55</ref> Burnside's boss at the time reputedly pulled strings to keep the murder sentence short, due to having need of Burnside's skills as a tractor driver.

Another album of acoustic material was recorded that year and little else was released before ''Hill Country Blues,'' in the early 1980s. Recorded between 1980 and 1984 by Leo Bruin in Groningen, Netherlands. An album's worth of [[single (music)|singles]] followed, released on [[ethnomusicology]] professor Dr. David Evans' [[High Water Recording Company|High Water]] [[record label]] in [[Memphis, Tennessee]].\n\n==Later life and career==\n[[Image:Liri Blues R. L. Burnside 1992.jpg|thumb|left|180px|R. L. Burnside at the [[Liri Blues Festival]], Italy, in 1992]]\nIn the 1990s, Burnside appeared in the [[documentary]] ''[[Deep Blues]]'' and began recording for the [[Oxford, Mississippi]] label [[Fat Possum Records]].<ref name=\"amg\"/> Founded by ''[[Living Blues]]'' [[magazine]] editor Peter Redvers-Lee and Matthew Johnson, the label was dedicated to recording aging North Mississippi bluesmen such as Burnside and [[Junior Kimbrough]].\n\nBurnside remained with Fat Possum from that time until his death, and he usually performed with [[drum]]mer Cedric Burnside, his grandson, and with his friend and understudy, the [[slide guitar]]ist [[Kenny Brown (guitarist)|Kenny Brown]], with whom he began playing in 1971 and claimed as his \"adopted son.\"\n\nIn the mid 1990s, Burnside attracted the attention of [[Jon Spencer]], the leader of the [[Jon Spencer Blues Explosion]], touring and recording with this group and gaining a new audience in the process.\n\nBurnside's 1996 album ''[[A Ass Pocket of Whiskey]]'' (recorded with Jon Spencer) gained critical acclaim, earning praise from [[Bono]] and [[Iggy Pop]]. During this time he also provided entertainment at private events such as [[Richard Gere]]'s birthday party.\n\nAfter the death of Kimbrough and the burning of Kimbrough's juke joint in [[Chulahoma, Mississippi]], Burnside quit recording studio material for Fat Possum, though he did continue to tour. The label produced a series of albums in which previously recorded materials were [[remix]]ed, with an eye to [[techno]], [[downtempo]] and [[hip-hop]] listeners. Notably, ''Come On In'' (1998), ''Wish I Was In Heaven Sitting Down'' (2000) and ''A Bothered Mind'' (2004), the first of which includes collaborations with [[Kid Rock]] and [[Lyrics Born]]. These albums received mixed reviews, some describing the results as \"unnatural\"<ref>''[http://www.allmusic.com/album/wish-i-was-in-heaven-sitting-down-mw0000101901 Wish I Was in Heaven Sitting Down]'', review by Alex Henderson</ref> while others lauded the playful spirit,<ref>''[http://www.allmusic.com/album/a-bothered-mind-mw0000165294 A Bothered Mind]'', review by Steve Leggett</ref> or \"the way it yokes authentic blues feeling to new technology\".<ref>{{Cite news| last = Andy Gill| title = Album: RL Burnside| work = The Independent| accessdate = 2014-01-22| date = 2004-10-08| url = http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/reviews/album-rl-burnside-542948.html}}</ref> Commercially, the remixes were successful, and two tracks from ''Come On In'' were included in [[Music on The Sopranos|''The Sopranos{{'}}'' soundtrack]]. In Between, Fat Possum released more traditional albums, drawing from previously unreleased material, both of their own sessions and from before their time. After a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] in 2001, Burnside's doctor advised him to stop drinking; Burnside did, but he reported that change left him unable to play. [[Image:R.L.

L. Burnside''). Youngest son Garry Burnside used to play bass guitar with Junior Kimbrough and in 2006 released an album with Cedric. In 2013 Duwayne Burnside and business partner Adrian Pinson opened up Alice Mae's caf\u00e9, named after Alice Mae Burnside on the square in Holly Springs, where the Burnsides and Kimbrough sons perform when they are not touring and on the road.\n\n==Style==\n[[Image:RL Burnside.jpg|thumb|left|200px|R. L. Burnside performing at the [[Crystal Ballroom (Portland, Oregon)|Crystal Ballroom]] in [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]], [[Oregon]] in January 2004]]\n{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2009}}\nBurnside had a powerful, expressive voice and played both [[electric guitar|electric]] and [[acoustic guitar]], with and without a slide. His drone-heavy style was more characteristic of [[North Mississippi hill country blues]] than [[Delta blues]].  Like other country blues musicians, he did not always adhere to strict [[twelve bar blues|12]]- or [[sixteen bar blues|16]]-bar blues patterns, often adding extra [[beat (music)|beats]] to a measure as he saw fit. He referred to this rhythmic eccentricity as \"Burnside style\" and recommended that backing musicians familiarize themselves with his style before playing along.\n\nAs was the case with his first role model [[John Lee Hooker]], Burnside's earliest recordings sound quite similar to one another, even repetitive, in vocal and instrumental styling. Many of these songs eschew traditional [[chord progression|chord changes]] in favor of a single [[chord (music)|chord]] or a simple [[bassline]] pattern that repeats throughout. Burnside played the guitar fingerstyle\u2014without a pick\u2014and often in open-G tuning. His vocal style is characterized by a tendency to \"break\" briefly into [[falsetto]], usually at the end of long notes.\n\nLike his contemporary [[T-Model Ford]], Burnside favored a stripped-down approach to the blues, marked by a quality of rawness, and portrayed himself as a lifelong hard-drinking man singing songs of swagger and rebellion. Burnside collaborated in the late 1990s with [[The Jon Spencer Blues Explosion]] on the album ''[[A Ass Pocket of Whiskey]]''; he consequently gained the attention of the alternative rock audience and was later cited as an influence by [[Hillstomp]]<ref name=amg /> and covered on record by [[The Immortal Lee County Killers]]. Burnside's fellow Fat Possum musicians [[The Black Keys]] also credit him as an influence and interpolated his \"Skinny Woman\" into their track \"[[The Big Come Up|Busted]]\" .\n\nBurnside knew many [[Deejay (Jamaican)|toasts]]\u2014African American narrative folk poems such as \"[[Signifying monkey]]\" and \"Tojo Told Hitler\"\u2014and fondly recited them between songs at his concerts and on recordings.\n\n==Selected albums==\n[[File:RL Burnside 1984.jpg|thumb|right|In Knoxville, Tenn, 1982]]\n* ''First Recordings'' (recorded in the late 1960s by George Mitchell; re-released by Fat Possum Records in 2003)\n* ''Plays and Sings the Mississippi Delta Blues'' (released 1981 by Swingmaster) (Live 1980 in the Netherlands)\n* ''Mississippi Hill Country Blues (released 1984 by Swingmaster)\n* ''Bad Luck City (1992)\n* ''Too Bad Jim'' (1994, produced by [[Robert Palmer (author/producer)|Robert Palmer]])\n* ''Well, Well, Well'' (songs and interviews from 1986\u20131993, released in 2001 on MC Records)\n* ''[[A Ass Pocket of Whiskey]]'' (1996, featuring the [[Jon Spencer Blues Explosion]])\n* ''Mr. Wizard'' (1997)\n* ''Acoustic Stories'' (1997, recorded 1988)\n* ''Sound Machine Groove'' (1997) (recordings from 1979-1980)\n* ''Mississippi Blues'' (1997) (live recordings from 1983-1984)\n* ''Going Down South'' (1998) (split album with Johnny Woods and Ranie Burnette, recordings from 1988)\n* ''My Black Name A-Ringin''' (1999) (recordings from 1969)\n* ''Burnside on Burnside'' (a critically acclaimed 2001 [[live album]] recorded in the [[Crystal Ballroom (Portland, Oregon)|Crystal Ballroom]] on [[Portland, Oregon]]'s Burnside Street)\n* ''Come On In''  (1998) (remixed material)\n* ''Wish I Was in Heaven Sitting Down'' (2000) (remixed material)\n* ''Burnside's Darker Blues'' (2003) (remixed material)\n* ''No Monkeys on This Train'' (2003) (compilation of songs from Sound Machine Groove, live material and stories)\n* ''A Bothered Mind'' (2004) (remixed material)\n* ''Raw Electric'' (2005) (Posthumous compilation of recordings from 1979-1980)\n* ''The King of Hill Country Blues: Rollin' & Tumblin''' (2010)(Posthumous compilation of recordings from 1975, 1989 and 1991.)\n\n==Films==\n*''[[Deep Blues: A Musical Pilgrimage to the Crossroads]]'' (1991).
