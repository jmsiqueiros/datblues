He had an elder brother named Glyn, and the family is believed to have come from [[Wales]].\n\nCyril Davies began his career in the early 1950s first within Steve Lane's Southern Stompers, then in 1955 formed an acoustic [[skiffle]] and blues group with [[Alexis Korner]].<ref name=\"Newman\">Newman, Richard. ''John Mayall: Blues Breaker''. Castle Communications, 1995. ISBN 1-86074-129-0. p. 70 et seq</ref> He began as a [[banjo]] and 12-string guitar player before becoming a [[Chicago blues|Chicago]]-style blues harmonica player after hearing [[Little Walter]].<ref name=\"Newman\" /> Working by day as a [[panel beater]], he ran an unsuccessful skiffle club before meeting Korner, then Davies and Korner opened a London Rhythm and Blues club 'England's Firstest and Bestest Skiffle Club', later known as the 'London Blues and Barrelhouse Club'. Popular with other musicians, the club hosted gigs by blues musicians such as [[Muddy Waters]], [[Sonny Terry]] and [[Brownie McGhee]] and [[Memphis Slim]].<ref name=\"Newman\" /> \n\nDuring this period Davies and Korner worked as session musicians, and often backed [[Ottilie Patterson]] during her featured set with husband [[Chris Barber| Chris Barber's]] band, using amplified instruments for the first time - which did not go down well with their blues purist audience and many fellow musicians.<ref name=\"Newman\" /> After closing the blues club, Davies and Korner went their separate ways, and, influenced by Muddy Waters electric sound, Davies formed his own electric blues band.<ref name=\"Newman\" /> \n\nIn 1962 Davies and Korner hooked up again, and on 17 March 1962 opened the [[Ealing Jazz Club|Ealing Club]] in London.<ref name=\"Newman\" /> The club became a platform for their band, to which they added bassist [[Jack Bruce]], saxophonist [[Dick Heckstall-Smith]] and drummer [[Charlie Watts]] and renamed themselves [[Blues Incorporated]]. [[Long John Baldry]] and Art Woods (brother of [[Ronnie Wood]]) also played in the band at some time. In June 1962 they recorded ''[[R&B from the Marquee]]'',<ref name=\"R&B\">{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r88999|pure_url=yes}}|title=Allmusic ((( Alexis Korner's Blues Incorporated > R&B from the Marquee > Overview )))}}</ref> actually recorded in [[Decca Records]] studio. Many young musicians visited the Ealing Club and 'guested' with Blues Incorporated, including [[Rod Stewart]], [[Paul Jones (singer)|Paul Jones]], [[Keith Richards]], [[Eric Burdon]], [[Mick Jagger]], [[Brian Jones]] and [[Ginger Baker]]. Jagger was in the audience for the second night at the club and got up to sing \"Got My Mojo Working\".<ref name=\"Newman\" />\n\nAfter touring the UK and headlining a residency at [[The Marquee]],<ref name=\"Newman\" /> by October 1962 there was musical tension in the band as some members wanted to play crowd pleasers like [[Chuck Berry]] and [[Bo Diddley]] songs while Cyril Davies and others members were blues [[purist]]s who wanted to play what they saw as only genuine Chicago-style [[rhythm & blues|R&B]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cyrildavies.com |title=A full account of Cyril's life and contribution to the development of the UK blues boom |publisher=Cyrildavies.com |date=2011-07-20 |accessdate=2011-10-21}}</ref><ref>but note that Alexis Korner recalls the split was because he, Heckstall-Smith, Baker and Jack Bruce were moving in a more jazz-based direction - Newman, Richard.
