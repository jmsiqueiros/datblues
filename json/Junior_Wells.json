I got a job on a soda truck... played hookey from school ... worked all week and on Saturday the man gave me a dollar and a half. A dollar and a half! For a whole week of work. I went to the pawnshop and the man said the price was two dollars. I told him I '''had''' to have that harp. He walked away from the counter -- left the harp there. So I laid my dollar-and-a-half on the counter and picked up the harp. When my trial came up, the judge asked my why I did it. I told him I '''had''' to have that harp. The judge asked me to play it and when I did he gave the man the 50 cents and hollered \"Case dismissed!\" (1948) \n\nWells began to have serious health problems, including cancer and a [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]], in 1997.<ref name=\"AMG\"/> He died in Chicago on January 15, 1998, and was interred in the [[Oak Woods Cemetery, Chicago]].<ref name=\"Dead\"/>\n\nWells was mentioned in the Steppenwolf song, \"Tighten Up Your Wig\", in which the lyrics explicitly state that they copied the music from Junior Wells' tune, \"Messing with the Kid\".\n\n==Album discography==\n{\u2020 Albums that feature Buddy Guy) \n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n*''[[Hoodoo Man Blues]]'' \u2020 (1965)\n*''It's My Life, Baby!'' \u2020 (1966)\n*''Chicago/The Blues/Today!'' vol. 1 \u2020 (1966)\n*''On Tap'' (1974)\n*''You're Tuff Enough'' (1968)\n*''Coming at You'' \u2020 (1968)\n*''Live at the Golden Bear'' (1969)\n*''Southside Blues Jam'' \u2020 (1969)\n*''Buddy and the Juniors'' \u2020 (1970)\n*''In My Younger Days'' (1972)\n*''Buddy Guy & Junior Wells Play the Blues'' \u2020 (1972)\n*''Live At Montreux'' \u2020 (1977)\n*''Blues Hit Big Town'' (1977)\n*''Pleading the Blues'' \u2020 (1979)\n*''Got To Use Your Head'' (1979)\n*''Drinkin' TNT 'n' Smokin' Dynamite'' \u2020 (1982)\n*''The Original Blues Brothers'' (1983)\n*''Messin\u2019 With The Kid, Vol 1'' (1986)\n*''Universal Rock'' (1986)\n*''Chiefly Wells'' (1986)\n{{col-2}}\n*''Harp Attack!''
