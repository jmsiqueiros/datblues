He was a regional star, had a high pompadour, a gold tooth smile with a tiny guitar inlaid. He had a few records out and some explosive licks with funky edges, rockabilly tremolo-influenced, wrote songs, too, said that he'd hung around libraries reading Rimbaud and Baudelaire to get his language down. He also told me that as a teenager he had played with Memphis Slim. I thought I had something in common with him there. I'd played with Big Joe Williams when I was coming up. Mason had some fine songs. One of them had the line, ''\"You do good things for people and it just makes them bad.\"''  I would have thought about recording it if I didn't have my own originals.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cdbaby.com/cd/masonruffner6 |title=Mason Ruffner &#124; Mason Ruffner &#124; CD Baby Music Store |publisher=Cdbaby.com |date= |accessdate=2013-05-22}}</ref>\n\nQuoted in ''[[The Dallas Morning News]]'' in 1986, Ruffner noted \"You buy some dark sunglasses.
