He played [[Americana (music)|Americana]], [[blues-rock]], [[Southern rock]] and [[rockabilly]] music.\n\n==Blues roots==\n\n[[File:Gene Kelton's headstone in Pine Valley Cemetery, Pine Valley, Texas.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Mean Gene Kelton's Grave stone]]\nBorn '''Sidney Eugene Kelton''',<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/metropolitan/7358430.html |title=Remembering 'Mean' Gene Kelton: Before his death in Crosby crash, guitarist and singer made his mark with 'biker blues' |publisher=Houston Chronicle |author=Joey Guerra |date=30 December 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6AKkBaqOi |archivedate=31 August 2012 |accessdate=2012-08-31}}</ref> in [[Booneville, Mississippi]], United States,<ref name=\"Dead\"/> his mother sang [[gospel music]] on the radio. She divorced his ne'er-do-well father when he was six. Afterward they lived with his grandfather, a cotton plantation share cropper. On weekends he listened to down-home blues in a dirt-floored juke joint. His step father, Bob Allbritton, who played [[rock and roll]] guitar then in a manner, as it can be said that Conway Twitty, sang country songs, exposed Kelton to all types of music. His mother bought him a Sears Silvertone guitar at the age of ten, and they moved to Texas where he formed his first band, The Moven Shadows. Following a serious motorcycle accident, he played with several cover bands until \"giving up\" music after his first marriage. It took years of moving through various jobs, getting back into music after a divorce, and trying for a few years to get together a band, going through what he called \"the worst of the worst\" musicians, before he finally formed The Gene Kelton Band with bass player A. J. Fee and drummer Russel Shelby, around the time of a national blues revival sparked by [[Stevie Ray Vaughan]].<ref name=\"northborder\">{{cite web |url=http://www.genekelton.com/press/northborder.html |title=Mean Gene Kelton |publisher=genekelton.com |author=Dave Miller |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070918235344/http://www.genekelton.com/press/northborder.html |archivedate= 18 September 2007 |accessdate=2012-08-31}}</ref> Kelton has been a full-time musician since 1983, when he began playing for tips in bars after losing his DJ job while newlywed in his second marriage and, in desperate straits, trying to support his unemployed bride and two sons from his previous marriage.<ref name=\"fullthrottle\">{{cite web |url=http://www.genekelton.com/press/fullthrottlearticle.html |title=Band On The Run |publisher=Full Throttle Magazine |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070918235317/http://www.genekelton.com/press/fullthrottlearticle.html |archivedate=18 September 2007 |accessdate=2012-08-31}}</ref> While publishing ''Texas Blues'' magazine in the early 1990s, he lost everything but the rights to his songs in his second divorce. The band went through another name, The Love Buzzards, before fans called them \"die hards\" for playing long sessions in the hot sun suggesting their final revision. Finally, a demo tape played on KPFT helped Kelton raise enough money to release his first album. Another musician saying, \"Gene you play a really mean guitar,\" led to his nickname and the title of the group's second album.<ref name=\"northborder\" />\n\n==Die Hard career==\nIn 1992 he named his current band The Die Hards, under which name they have been playing ever since. At the time of his death Kelton was playing with drummer Ted McCumber and bass guitarist Ed Starkey( who has played with such names as the [[Dottie West]] Band).<ref name=\"fullthrottle\" />\n\nIn December 1999, he released his first blues CD (Jambone Records), ''[[Most Requested]]''. The album was quickly picked up by several Houston Radio stations, occupying the No.&nbsp;1 call-in request on some of these stations.  In addition to radio coverage, which garnered him mainly local attention, his popularity spread online through such sites as [[mp3.com]] where various songs from ''Most Requested'' remained at the top 10 for two years. Kelton's making his music available for download on the internet has resulted in a listener base spanning the globe with over 150 radio stations around the world carrying his music and an average of over 150,000 hits per month on his website.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}  In 2003, he released his second blues CD ''[[Mean Guitar]]''. In 2007, Kelton released ''[[Going Back To Memphis: A Biker Band Tribute To Elvis]]'', a tribute to the [[Elvis Presley]], recorded in [[Sun Studios]].\n\n==Style==\nKelton's songs are most notable for powerful guitar and lyrics that range from emotional to raunchy.  His raunchier songs often use [[innuendo]], with lyrics that taken literally are perfectly benign. Such songs include: \"The [[Avon Products, Inc.|Avon]] Man\", \"Let Me Pump Your Gas\",<ref name=\"Dead\"/> and \"Two Thangs\". Others are a little more overt in their sexuality, such as \"The Texas City Dyke\", \"My Blow Up Lover\", and, his most well-known tune, \"My Baby Don't Wear No Panties\",<ref name=\"Dead\"/> which Kelton began improvising to the tune of \"Mean Mistreater\" in 1988 when, after a drunken girl jumped up on a bar table, ripped off her shirt and began dancing, a guy yelled out, \"That ain't nothing, my baby don't wear no panties.\" Eventually it evolved into the current audience participation version with fans shouting, \"How do you know?\" after each chorus. Discovering how audiences respond to songs with sexual innuendos, Kelton really caught their attention by beginning \"The Texas City Dyke\", ''\"She's got tattoos on her titties.\"'' Gradually he developed this into his song by using all the jokes he had heard about this landmark fishing dike.<ref name=\"northborder\" />\n\nSome of his songs have a more pained or melancholy feeling to them.  Examples are the nostalgic songs \"Cruisin' Texas Avenue\" and \"Leaving Paradise\". Another common theme in several of his songs is the power of the blues. Songs like \"Sweet Mother Blues\" and \"If Everybody Loved The Blues\", extol blues music as having remarkable properties, like being able to end war and having \"almighty healin' powers\".\n\nMany of his songs use [[alliteration]] in their lyrics. Some alliterative lines include \"Sweetest song we ever sang was in each others arms\" and \"Sowed my seeds in search of truth\". His songs also contain lots of [[image]]ry.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}\n\nSelf-described as a performing \"black leather blues and redneck rock 'n roll,\"<ref name=\"website\">{{cite web |url=http://www.meangenekelton.com/ |title=Official website |deadurl=no |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6AKl8UxzE |archivedate=31 August 2012 |accessdate=2012-08-31}}</ref> Mean Gene Kelton & The Die Hards have been called by ''[[ReverbNation]]'' \"one of the top Biker Rally and Blues Festival headliner acts.\"<ref name=\"Reverb\">{{cite web |url=http://www.reverbnation.com/meangenekelton |title=Mean Gene Kelton & The Die Hards |publisher=ReverbNation.coman online music marketing platform |deadurl=no |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6AKlSSs01 |archivedate=31 August 2012 |accessdate=2012-08-31}}</ref>\n\n==Death==\nKelton was killed on 28 December 2010,<ref name=\"Dead\">{{cite web |url=http://www.thedeadrockstarsclub.com/2010b.html |title=The Dead Rock Stars Club |deadurl=no |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6AKkSzcNW |archivedate=31 August 2012 |accessdate=2012-08-31}}</ref> when his [[SUV]] collided head-on with a [[school bus]] in [[Crosby, Texas]], two days before he was due to perform on [[New Years Eve]] at Rowdy Buck's in [[Crosby, Texas]].\n\n==Discography==\n* ''[[Most Requested]]'' (1999)\n* ''[[Mean Guitar]]'' (2003)\n* ''[[Going Back To Memphis: A Biker Band Tribute To Elvis]]'' (2007)\n* ''The Lost Sessions'' - unpublished but available at shows<ref name=\"northborder\" />\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.genekelton.com Listen to over a dozen of Mean Gene Kelton & The Die Hards songs]\n* [http://www.reverbnation.com/meangenekelton Listen to over twenty of Mean Gene Kelton & The Die Hards songs]\n* [http://genekelton.com/blog/ Gene Kelton's co-starring role in ''Marfa Red'']\n* [http://www.khou.com/news/-1-killed-in-wreck-involving-school-bus--112582489.html Crosby: Fans remember blues guitarist killed in crash]\n\n{{Authority control|VIAF=170280035}}\n\n{{Persondata <!-- Metadata: see [[Wikipedia:Persondata]]. -->\n| NAME              = Kelton, Sidney Eugene\n| ALTERNATIVE NAMES = Kelton, Gene\n| SHORT DESCRIPTION = American guitarist, harmonica player and singer-songwriter\n| DATE OF BIRTH     = 10 April 1953\n| PLACE OF BIRTH    = [[Booneville, Mississippi]], United States\n| DATE OF DEATH     = 28 December 2010\n| PLACE OF DEATH    = [[Crosby, Texas]], United States\n}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Kelton, Gene}}\n[[Category:1953 births]]\n[[Category:2010 deaths]]\n[[Category:American singer-songwriters]]\n[[Category:American rockabilly musicians]]\n[[Category:American harmonica players]]\n[[Category:Blues rock musicians]]\n[[Category:People from Prentiss County, Mississippi]]\n[[Category:Musicians from Mississippi]]\n[[Category:Road accident deaths in Texas]]\n[[Category:Accidental deaths in Texas]]\n[[Category:Musicians from Houston, Texas]]"}]}}}}
