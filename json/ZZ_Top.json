The band consists of [[guitarist]] and [[lead vocalist]] [[Billy Gibbons]], [[bassist]] and co-lead vocalist [[Dusty Hill]], and [[drummer]] [[Frank Beard (musician)|Frank Beard]]. One of the few [[major label]] recording groups to have consisted of the same lineup for more than forty years, ZZ Top has been praised by critics and fellow musicians alike for their technical mastery. Of the group, music writer [[Cub Koda]] said \"As genuine roots musicians, they have few peers; Gibbons is one of America's finest blues guitarists working in the arena rock idiom... while Hill and Beard provide the ultimate rhythm section support.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/zz-top-mn0000690254/biography|title=All Music Guide Artist Biography}}</ref>\n\nSince the release of the band's [[ZZ Top's First Album|debut album]] in January 1971, ZZ Top has become known for its strong [[blues]] roots and humorous lyrical motifs, relying heavily on [[double entendre]]s and [[innuendo]]. ZZ Top's musical style has changed over the years, beginning with blues-inspired rock on their early albums, then incorporating [[New wave music|new wave]], [[punk rock]] and [[dance-rock]], with heavy use of [[synthesizer]]s.\n\nZZ Top was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 2004. As a group, ZZ Top possesses 11 [[Music recording sales certification|gold records]] and 7 platinum (13 multi-platinum) records; their 1983 album, ''[[Eliminator (album)|Eliminator]]'', remains the group's most commercially successful record, selling over 10 million units. ZZ Top also ranks 80th in U.S. album sales, with 25 million units. ZZ Top has sold over 50 million albums worldwide.\n\n==History==\n\n===Early years (1969\u20131972)===\nThe original line-up formed in [[Houston]], by Billy Gibbons, organist Lanier Greig (died February 2013)<ref>''[[Houston Chronicle]]'', February 16, 2013</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thedeadrockstarsclub.com/2013.html#sthash.DtdEh0NS.dpbs|title=The Dead Rock Stars Club - January to June 2013|publisher=Thedeadrockstarsclub.com|accessdate=2013-08-14}}</ref> and drummer Dan Mitchell. On The Tonight Show, [[Jimi Hendrix]] stated that [[Billy Gibbons]] would be the next hottest guitarist.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.paulgabriel.net/id25.html|title=The Legend of the Pink Stratocaster|accessdate=2012-04-15}}</ref> There were longstanding rumors that, at the end of a tour, Hendrix gave Gibbons the pink Stratocaster he had been playing as token of his appreciation for Gibbons' level of talent. ZZ Top was managed by [[Waxahachie, Texas|Waxahachie]]-native [[Bill Ham]], who had befriended Gibbons a year earlier. They released their first single, \"Salt Lick\", in 1969, and side B contained the song \"Miller's Farm\"; both songs were credited to Gibbons. Immediately after the recording of \"Salt Lick\", Greig was replaced by bassist Billy Ethridge, a band mate of [[Stevie Ray Vaughan]], and Mitchell was replaced by [[Frank Beard (musician)|Frank Beard]] of the [[American Blues]]. Due to lack of interest from record companies, ZZ Top was presented with a record deal from [[London Records]].{{Clarify| reason = 'Due to...' doesn't make any sense in this sentence.| date = June 2013}} Unwilling to sign a recording contract, Ethridge quit the band and [[Dusty Hill]] was selected as his replacement. After Hill moved from [[Dallas]] to Houston, ZZ Top signed with London in 1970. They performed their first concert together at the Knights of Columbus Hall in [[Beaumont, Texas|Beaumont]] on February 10.\n\nIn addition to assuming the role as the band's leader, Gibbons became the main lyricist and musical arranger. With the assistance of Ham and engineer Robin Hood Brians, ''[[ZZ Top's First Album]]'' (1971) was released and saw the inclusion of the band's humor, with \"barrelhouse\" rhythms, distorted guitars, double entendres and innuendo. The music and songs  reflected ZZ Top's [[blues]] influences. Following their debut album, the band released ''[[Rio Grande Mud]]'' (1972), which failed commercially and the promotional tour consisted of mostly empty auditoriums.\n\n===First decade and signature sound (1973\u20131982)===\nZZ Top released ''[[Tres Hombres]]'' in 1973. The album's earthy and infectious sound was the result of the propulsive support provided by Hill and Beard, and Gibbons' \"growling\" guitar tone. Dan Erlewine wrote that the album \"brought ZZ Top their first Top Ten record, making them stars in the process\". The album included the boogie-driven \"[[La Grange (song)|La Grange]]\", which was written about a [[brothel]] in [[La Grange, Texas]]. On the subsequent tour, the band performed sold-out concerts in the US. ZZ Top recorded the live tracks for their 1975 album, ''[[Fandango!]]'', during this tour; the album showcased their prowess in exciting live audiences. ''Fandango!'' was a top ten album and its single, \"[[Tush (ZZ Top song)|Tush]]\", peaked at number 20 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100. ''[[Tejas (album)|Tejas]]'', released in 1976, was not as successful or as positively received as their previous efforts, although the album went to No.17 on ''Billboard'''s Pop Albums chart.<ref>{{cite web\n  | title = Tejas Billboard Albums Chart\n  |publisher=allmusic\n  |work=Billboard\n  | year = 2009\n  | url = http://allmusic.com/album/tejas-r22731/charts-awards/billboard-album\n  | accessdate =December 19, 2010}}</ref> ZZ Top continued the Worldwide Texas Tour in support of ''Tejas'', though they had been touring for seven years.\n\nThe band went on what was supposed to be a 90-day break from public appearances. Gibbons traveled to Europe, Beard went to [[Jamaica]], and Hill went to [[Mexico]].<ref>{{cite web\n  | last = di Perna\n  | first = Alan\n  | title = The Long Hiatus: ZZ Top Explore the Globetrotters\n  | work=Guitar World\n  | publisher=Future US\n  | date = July 2, 2008\n  | url = http://www.guitarworld.com/article/zz_top_cars_guitars_three_unlikely_rock_stars?page=0,8\n  | accessdate =December 19, 2010}}</ref> The break extended to two years, during which Gibbons and Hill grew chest-length [[beard]]s.<ref>Tom Vickers, sleeve notes for ''[[Rancho Texicano]] (Warner Bros Records Inc., 2004).</ref>\n\nIn 1979, ZZ Top signed with [[Warner Bros.

In April 1980, ZZ Top made their first appearance in Europe, performing for the German music television show ''[[Rockpalast]]''. The next album, ''[[El Loco]]'', was released in October 1981, featuring three singles (\"[[Tube Snake Boogie]]\", \"[[Pearl Necklace (song)|Pearl Necklace]]\", and \"Leila\").<ref>{{cite web\n  | title = El Loco Billboard Singles Chart\n  |publisher=allmusic\n  |work=Billboard\n  | year = 2009\n  | url = http://allmusic.com/album/el-loco-r22735/charts-awards/billboard-single\n  | accessdate =December 19, 2010}}</ref>\n\n===Synthesizer period (1983\u20131991)===\n[[File:ZZTop.jpg|thumb|230px|right|Dusty Hill and Billy F.

''[[Eliminator (album)|Eliminator]]'', released in March 1983, featured two Top 40 singles (\"[[Gimme All Your Lovin']]\" and \"[[Legs (song)|Legs]]\"), four Mainstream Rock hits (including \"[[Got Me Under Pressure]]\" and \"[[Sharp Dressed Man]]\"), and \"Legs\" peaking at No.13 on the [[Hot Dance Club Songs|Club Play Singles]] chart.<ref>{{cite web\n  | title = Eliminator Billboard Singles Chart\n  |publisher=allmusic\n  |work=Billboard\n  | year = 2009\n  | url = http://allmusic.com/album/eliminator-r22736/charts-awards/billboard-single\n  | accessdate =December 19, 2010}}</ref> ''Eliminator'' was a critical and commercial success, selling more than 10 million copies,<ref name=\"riaa2\">{{cite web\n  | title = RIAA \u2013 Gold & Platinum\n  | publisher=RIAA\n  | url = http://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?resultpage=2&table=SEARCH_RESULTS&action=&title=&artist=zz%20top&format=&debutLP=&category=&sex=&releaseDate=&requestNo=&type=&level=&label=&company=&certificationDate=&awardDescription=&catalogNo=&aSex=&rec_id=&charField=&gold=&platinum=&multiPlat=&level2=&certDate=&album=&id=&after=&before=&startMonth=1&endMonth=1&startYear=1958&endYear=2010&sort=Artist&perPage=25\n  | accessdate =December 19, 2010}}</ref> and several music videos were in regular rotation on MTV. The band also won their first [[MTV Video Music Award]]s in the categories of [[MTV Video Music Award for Best Group Video|Best Group Video]] for \"Legs,\" and [[MTV Video Music Award for Best Direction|Best Direction]] for \"Sharp Dressed Man\". The music videos were included in their ''[[Greatest Hits (ZZ Top DVD)|Greatest Hits]]'' video, which has been released on DVD ever since and quickly went multi-platinum.<ref name=\"riaa2\"/>\n\nBilly Gibbons, breaking three decades of silence on the subject, stated reasons for a change in their direction as he discussed a fellow named Linden Hudson to a journalist (Joe Bosso) in June 3, 2013, Gibbons said: \u201cHe (Linden) brought some elements to the forefront that helped reshape what ZZ Top were doing, starting in the studio and eventually to the live stage. Linden had no fear and was eager to experiment in ways that would frighten most bands. But we followed suit, and the synthesizers started to show up on record.\"<ref>{{cite web|author=Joe Bosso |url=http://www.musicradar.com/news/guitars/billy-gibbons-talks-zz-top-the-complete-studio-albums-1970-1990-575728/8 |title=Billy Gibbons talks ZZ Top: The Complete Studio Albums (1970-1990) &#124; El Loco (1981) |publisher=MusicRadar |date= |accessdate=2013-08-14}}</ref> However, the Eliminator album was not without controversy. According to former stage manager David Blayney (15 years as ZZ Top's stage manager) in his book, Sharp Dressed Men (Hyperion Books), sound engineer Linden Hudson co-wrote much of the material on the album (Eliminator) as a live-in high-tech music teacher to Beard and Gibbons. And, despite continued denials by the band, it settled a five-year legal battle with Hudson, paying him $600,000 after he proved he held the copyright to the song \"Thug\" which appeared on Eliminator.<ref>^ Blayney, David (1994).

The albums ''ZZ Top's First Album'', ''Rio Grande Mud'', ''Tres Hombres'', ''Fandango'' and ''Tejas'' were remixed with the result that the sound of the material from the first five albums was changed to sound like they had been recorded in the 1980s, with echo and drum machines, and very unlike their original album sound.<ref name=\"sixpack\">{{Cite book |author=Bob Merlis and Jim Bessman|title=ZZ on CD: Meeting The Digital Challenge Head On |location=ZZ Top Six Pack CD Booklet | publisher=Warner Bros Records|year=1987|page=2}}</ref> Many of the original mixes were used on the 2003-CD box set ''[[Chrome, Smoke & BBQ]]'', and its companion piece ''[[Rancho Texicano]]''. Also, remastered versions of ''[[Tres Hombres]]'' and ''[[Fandango!]]'' were eventually released on CD in 2006 with the original mixes intact. In 2013, [[Warner Brothers]] released [[The Complete Studio Albums 1970-1990]], a 10-CD box set which contained the original mixes of ''[[ZZ Top's First Album]]'', ''[[Rio Grande Mud]]'', and ''[[Tejas (album)|Tejas]]'' for the first time on CD.\n\n''[[Recycler (album)|Recycler]]'', released in 1990, was ZZ Top's last studio album under contract with Warner Records. ''Recycler'' was also the last of a distinct sonic trilogy in the ZZ Top catalogue. The collection actually marked a return towards the earlier, simpler guitar-driven blues sound with less synthesizer and pop bounce of the previous two albums. This move did not entirely suit the fan base that ''Eliminator'' and ''Afterburner'' had built up, and while ''Recycler'' did achieve platinum status, it never matched the sales of ''Eliminator'' and ''Afterburner''. The cartoonish and sexy-ZZ-girl videos continued in singles like \"My Head's in Mississippi\", \"Give It Up\", and \"Burger Man\".\n\n===Return to guitar-driven sound (1992\u20132003)===\nIn 1992, Warner released ''ZZ Top's Greatest Hits'', along with a new [[Rolling Stones]]-style cut, \"Gun Love\", and an [[Elvis]]-inflected video, \"Viva Las Vegas\". In 1993, ZZ Top inducted a major influence, [[Cream (band)|Cream]], into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]].\n\nIn 1994 the band signed to a $35&nbsp;million deal with [[RCA Records]],<ref name=\"rockhonors\">{{cite web\n  | title = VH1 Rock Honors 2007 \u2013 Honorees\n  | publisher=[[VH1]]\n  | year = 2007\n  | url = http://www.vh1.com/shows/events/rock_honors/_2007/honorees.jhtml\n  | accessdate =December 19, 2010}}</ref> releasing the million-selling ''[[Antenna (ZZ Top album)|Antenna]]'' in 1994. Subsequent RCA albums, ''[[Rhythmeen]]'' (1996) and 1999's ''[[XXX (ZZ Top album)|XXX]]'' (the second album to feature live tracks) sold well, but did not reach the levels enjoyed previously. ZZ Top, however, continued to play to enthusiastic live audiences. In 2003 ZZ Top released a final RCA album, ''[[Mescalero (album)|Mescalero]]'', an album thick with harsh Gibbons guitar and featuring a [[hidden track]] \u2013 a cover version of \"[[As Time Goes By (song)|As Time Goes By]]\". RCA impresario Clive Davis wanted to do a collaboration record (in the mode of [[Carlos Santana]]'s successful ''Supernatural'') for this album. In an interview in ''Goldmine'' magazine, artists [[Pink (singer)|Pink]], [[Dave Matthews]], and [[Wilco]] were among the artists slated for the project.\nZZ Top performed \"[[Tush (ZZ Top song)|Tush]]\" and \"[[Legs (song)|Legs]]\" as part of the [[Super Bowl XXXI]] halftime show in 1997.\n\nA comprehensive four-CD collection of recordings from the London and Warner Bros. years, ''[[Chrome, Smoke & BBQ]]'', was released in 2003. It featured the band's first single (A- and B-side), several rare B-side tracks as well as a radio promotion from 1979, a live track and several extended dance mix versions of their biggest MTV hits. Three tracks from Billy Gibbons' pre-ZZ band, The Moving Sidewalks, were also included.\n\n===Critical acclaim and retrospective releases (2004\u20132011)===\nIn 2004, ZZ Top was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]]. [[Keith Richards]] of [[The Rolling Stones]] gave the induction speech. ZZ Top gave a brief performance, playing \"La Grange\" and \"Tush\".\n\nExpanded and remastered versions of the original studio albums from the 1970s and '80s are currently in production. Marketed as \"Remastered and Expanded\", these releases include additional live tracks which were not present on the original recordings. Three such CDs have been released to date (''Tres Hombres'', ''Fandango!'', and ''Eliminator''). The first two were released in 2006 and use the original mixes free from echo and drum machines, while ''Eliminator'' was released in 2008. The ''Eliminator'' re-release also features a collector's edition version containing a DVD featuring several videos and additional live tracks.<ref>[http://www.zztop.com/index.php?module=news_item&news_item_id=116 ZZ Top | news_item]{{dead link|date=October 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe ''Eliminator Collector's Edition'' CD/DVD, celebrating the 25th anniversary of the band's iconic RIAA Diamond Certified album, was released September 10, 2008.
