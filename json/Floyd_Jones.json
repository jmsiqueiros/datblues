A number of Jones' [[sound recording and reproduction|recordings]] are regarded as classics of the [[Chicago blues]] idiom,<ref>{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p401|pure_url=yes}}|title=allmusic ((( Floyd Jones > Overview )))|publisher=www.allmusic.com|accessdate=2008-04-16}}</ref> and his song \"[[On the Road Again (Canned Heat song)|On The Road Again]]\" was a top ten [[hit record|hit]] for [[Canned Heat]] in 1968.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oldiesloon.com/il/wls093068.htm|title=wls093068|publisher=www.oldiesloon.com|accessdate=2008-04-28}}\n</ref>  Notably for a blues artist of his era, several of his songs have economic or social themes, such as \"Stockyard Blues\" (which refers to a strike at the Union Stockyards), \"Hard Times\" or \"Schooldays\".<ref>Rowe, M. ''Chicago Blues: the city and the music'', New York: Da Capo Press 1981, p. 97</ref>\n\n==Life and career==\nJones was born in [[Marianna, Arkansas|Marianna]], [[Arkansas]].  He started playing [[guitar]] seriously after being given a guitar by [[Howlin' Wolf]], and worked as an itinerant musician in the Arkansas and [[Mississippi]] area in the 1930s and early 1940s, before settling in [[Chicago]] in 1945.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hubcap.clemson.edu/~campber/planetmarvel.html|title=Planet and Marvel|publisher=hubcap.clemson.edu|accessdate=2008-05-02}}</ref>  \n\nIn Chicago, Jones took up the [[electric guitar]], and was one of a number of musicians playing on [[Maxwell Street]] and in non-union venues in the late 1940s who played an important role in the development of the post-war Chicago Blues sound.  This group included [[Little Walter]] and [[Jimmy Rogers]], both of who went on to become mainstays of the [[Muddy Waters]] band, and also [[Snooky Pryor]], Floyd's cousin [[Moody Jones]] and [[mandolin]] player [[Johnny 'Man' Young|Johnny Young]].  His first recording session in 1947, with Snooky on [[harmonica]] and Moody on guitar, produced the sides \"Stockyard Blues\" and \"Keep What You Got\", which formed one of the two records released by the Marvel Label, and was one of the first examples of the new style on record.  A second session in 1949 resulted in a release on the similarly short-lived Tempo-Tone label.  During the 1950s Jones also had records released on [[J.O.B. Records|JOB]], [[Chess Records|Chess]] and [[Vee-Jay]], and in 1966 he recorded for the [[Testament Records (USA)|Testament]] label's ''Masters of Modern Blues'' series.<ref>Leadbitter, M. and Slaven, N., ''Blues Records 1943 to 1970 Vol. 1'', London: Record Information services 2nd Ed. 1987</ref>\n\nJones continued performing in Chicago for the rest of his life, although he had few further recording opportunities.  Later in his career the [[bass guitar|electric bass]] became his main instrument.<ref>{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p401|pure_url=yes}}|title=allmusic ((( Floyd Jones > Overview )))|publisher=www.allmusic.com|accessdate=2008-04-16}}</ref>  He died in Chicago in December 1989.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.wirz.de/music/jonesfl.htm Illustrated Floyd Jones discography]\n\n{{Authority control|VIAF=14521632}}\n{{Persondata <!-- Metadata: see [[Wikipedia:Persondata]]. -->\n| NAME              = Jones, Floyd\n| ALTERNATIVE NAMES =\n| SHORT DESCRIPTION = [[United States|American]] [[Chicago blues]] singer, guitarist and songwriter\n| DATE OF BIRTH     = July 21, 1917\n| PLACE OF BIRTH    = [[Marianna, Arkansas|Marianna]], [[Arkansas]], [[United States]]\n| DATE OF DEATH     = December 19, 1989\n| PLACE OF DEATH    = [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]], United States\n}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Jones, Floyd}}\n[[Category:1917 births]]\n[[Category:1989 deaths]]\n[[Category:Chicago blues musicians]]\n[[Category:American blues musicians]]\n[[Category:American blues guitarists]]\n[[Category:American blues singers]]\n[[Category:People from Lee County, Arkansas]]\n[[Category:American buskers]]\n[[Category:Chess Records artists]]"}]}}}}
