He partnered with other notable blues musicians such as [[Son House]] and [[Charlie Patton]], and had a great influence on [[Robert Johnson]] and [[Muddy Waters]].<ref name=\"Grossman\">{{cite book | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ykHtup92Er0C&dq=&source=gbs_navlinks_s | title=Delta Blues Guitar | publisher=[[Alfred Music Publishing]] | author=Stefan Grossman | year=2007 | pages=16 | isbn=0739042807}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/artists/robert-johnson/biography | title=Robert Johnson Biography | publisher=[[Rolling Stone]] | date=date unknown | accessdate=30 March 2014}}</ref> Brown is considered one of the main pioneering musicians of the [[Delta blues]] genre.<ref name=\"PBS\"/>\n\nBorn in [[Clarksdale, Mississippi]], he learned the guitar as a teenager. During his music career he was best known as a side player performing mostly with bluesmen Son House, Charlie Patton, and Robert Johnson. He had recorded four sides for [[Paramount Records]] in [[Grafton, Wisconsin]] in the 1930s, which were subsequently released on [[78rpm]] discs. The second time he recorded was with Son House accompanying him in three 1941 [[Library of Congress]] recordings. Brown briefly joined House in 1952 in [[Rochester, New York]], but soon returned to [[Tunica, Mississippi]] where he died the same year.\n\nHe was mostly known as an accompanist rather than a soloist, although he did record three high rated solo performances. His recorder songs were \"M & O Blues,\" \"Make Me a Pallet on the Floor,\" and \"Future Blues\". He disappeared from the music scene during the 1940s together with Son House, and died before the first [[blues revival]] started.\n\n== Life and career ==\nBorn Willie Lee Brown<ref name=\"Dead\"/> in [[Clarksdale, Mississippi]],<ref name=\"amg\">[{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p60172/biography|pure_url=yes}} Allmusic biography]</ref> Brown played with such notables as [[Charlie Patton|Charley Patton]] and [[Robert Johnson (musician)|Robert Johnson]]. He was not known to be a self-promoting frontman, preferring to \"second\" other musicians. Little is known for certain of the man whom Robert Johnson called \"You can run, you can run, tell my friend Willie Brown\" (in his \"[[Cross Road Blues]]\") and whom Johnson once indicated should be notified in event of his death. In an alternate take of the song, Johnson introduced a [[Neologism]] with \"tell my friend boy Willie Brown.\" Brown is heard with Patton on the [[Paramount Records|Paramount]] sessions of 1930, playing \"M & O Blues,\" and \"Future Blues.\"<ref>[http://www.lala.com/#album/937030197521418407 Lala.com]</ref> Apart from playing with [[Son House]] and Charlie Patton it has also been said that he played with artists such as Luke Thomson and Thomas \"Clubfoot\" Coles. At least four other songs he recorded for Paramount have never been found.\n\n\"Rowdy Blues\", a 1929 song credited to [[Kid Bailey]], is disputed to have Brown on backup, or Brown himself using the name of Kid Bailey. Both \"M & O Blues\" and \"Future Blues\" appear on the album ''Son House & The Great Delta Blues Singers'' ([[1994 in music|1994]]), recorded between [[1928 in music|1928]] and 1930, on the Document Records label.  They also appear on JSP's Charlie Patton box set.\n\n[[David Evans (musicologist)|David Evans]] has reconstructed the early biography of a Willie Brown living in [[Drew, Mississippi]], until 1929. He was married by 1911, meaning he was 10 or 11, to a proficient guitarist named Josie Mills. He is recalled as singing and playing guitar with [[Charley Patton]] and others in the neighbourhood of Drew.<ref>Evans, David. ''Big Road Blues. Tradition & Creativity in the Folk Blues''. Da Capo (1982). ISBN 0-306-80300-3</ref> Informants with conflicting memories led [[Gayle Dean Wardlow]] and Steve Calt to conclude that this was a different Willie Brown.<ref>Wardlow, Gayle Dean. ''Chasin' that Devil Music. Searching for the Blues.'' Miller Freeman Books (1998). ISBN 0-87930-552-5</ref>\nEvans rejects this, believing that the singing and guitar style of the 1931 recordings is clearly in the tradition of other performers from Drew such as Charley Patton, [[Tommy Johnson (blues musician)|Tommy Johnson]], Kid Bailey, [[Howling Wolf]] and artists recorded non-commercially.\n\n[[Alan Lomax]] added further confusion in 1993, suggesting that the William Brown he recorded in Arkansas in 1942  was the same man as the Paramount artist.<ref>Lomax, Alan. ''The Land Where the Blues Began''. Methuen (1993). ISBN 0-413-67850-4</ref> The recording was for a joint project between [[Fisk University]] and the [[Library of Congress]] documenting the music of [[Coahoma County, Mississippi]] in 1941 and 1942.  Writing over fifty years later, Lomax forgot that he had actually recorded Willie the previous summer with [[Son House]], [[Fiddlin' Joe Martin]] and Leroy Williams. Brown played second guitar on three performances by the whole band, and recorded one solo, \"[[Make Me a Pallet on the Floor]]\". \n\nThe later biography is clear. Willie Brown, the Paramount artist, lived in [[Robinsonville, Mississippi]] from 1929 and moved to Lake Cormorant, Mississippi by 1935. He performed occasionally with Charley Patton, and continually with [[Son House]] until his death. \n\nBrown died of [[heart disease]] in [[Tunica, Mississippi]] in 1952, at the age of 52.<ref name=\"Dead\">[http://thedeadrockstarsclub.com/1950.html Thedeadrockstarsclub.com]</ref>\n\n== Discography ==\nBrown recorded six sides at a 1930 recording session in Grafton, WI.
