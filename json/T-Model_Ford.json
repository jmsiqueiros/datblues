At this time, Ford was sentenced to ten years on a [[chain gang]] for murder. Allegedly, Ford was able to reduce his sentence to two years.<ref name=fatpossum.com/> He spent many of his years following his release in conflicts with law enforcement.\n\nFord lived in [[Greenville, Mississippi]] and for a time wrote an advice column for ''[[Arthur (magazine)|Arthur]]'' magazine. Reportedly, he had twenty six children.<ref name = deltaforce /><ref name = nyorker />\n\nAccording to music writer [[Will Hodgkinson]], who met and interviewed Ford for his book ''Guitar Man'', Ford took up the guitar when his fifth wife left him and gave him a guitar as a leaving present. Ford trained himself without being able to read music or guitar tabs. Hodgkinson observed that Ford could not explain his technique. He simply worked out a way of playing that sounded like the guitarists he admired&nbsp;\u2014 [[Muddy Waters]] and [[Howlin' Wolf]].\n\nFord toured [[juke joint]]s and other venues, for a while opening for [[Buddy Guy]].<ref name=\"AMG\"/> In 1995, he was discovered by Matthew Johnson of [[Fat Possum Records]],<ref name=nyorker>McInerney, Jay. \"White man at the door; one man's mission to record the 'dirty blues'&nbsp;\u2014 before everyone dies.\" ''[[The New Yorker]]'', February 4, 2002: 54+.

The project began as a single event, with Ford needing assistance to play the [[Deep Blues Festival]] in [[Minnesota]] in July 2008.  GravelRoad, longtime fans of Ford and performers already scheduled for the festival, agreed to provide support for a ten-show United States [[concert tour|tour]] for Ford through July.\n\nFord had a [[pacemaker]] inserted at the end of that tour, but appeared on stage again with GravelRoad in 2008, 2009 and 2010. He suffered a [[stroke]] in early 2010, but despite difficulty with right-hand mobility, managed to complete a successful tour with GravelRoad. This tour concluded with an  appearance at [[Pickathon Festival]]. Ford and GravelRoad opened the third day of the [[All Tomorrow's Parties (music festival)|All Tomorrow's Parties Festival]], in New York over [[Labor Day]] weekend, 2010, curated by American independent film-maker [[Jim Jarmusch]].\n\nGravelRoad backed Ford on his 2010 and 2011 albums, ''The Ladies Man'' and ''Taledragger'', both released by [[Alive Naturalsound Records]].\n\nFord suffered a second stroke in the summer of 2012 that limited his public appearances.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cathead.biz/CatHead/Music_Calendar.html |title=Music Calendar |publisher=Cathead.biz |date= |accessdate=2013-03-17}}</ref>  However, he was able to perform at that year's [[King Biscuit Blues Festival]] in October.\n\nOn July 16, 2013, Fat Possum announced that Ford died at home in Greenville of respiratory failure after a prolonged illness.<ref name=fatpossumdeath>{{cite web|url=http://www.fatpossum.com/news/333 |title=R.I.P.
