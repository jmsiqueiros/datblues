He has appeared in over 40 films and is best known for his role as Elliott Taylor in [[Steven Spielberg]]'s ''[[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial]]'' (1982), ''[[Cloak & Dagger (1984 film)|Cloak & Dagger]]'' (1984), ''[[Gangs of New York]]'' (2002) and as a young [[Norman Bates]] in ''[[Psycho IV: The Beginning]]'' (1990).\n\n==Personal life==\nThomas was born an only child in [[San Antonio, Texas]], the son of Carolyn L. ([[married and maiden names|n\u00e9e]] Davis), a homemaker, and Henry Jackson Thomas, a hydraulic machinist.<ref>[http://www.filmreference.com/film/82/Henry-Thomas.html Henry Thomas profile at FilmReference.com]</ref> He attended [[East Central High School (Texas)|East Central High School]] in San Antonio and [[Blinn College]] in [[Brenham, Texas|Brenham]].<ref>[http://www.hs.ecisd.net/index.htm East Central High School website]</ref>\n\n==Career==\n===Acting career===\nAfter ''E.T.'', Thomas returned to Texas and only occasionally acted (''[[Cloak & Dagger (1984 film)|Cloak & Dagger]]'' and on TV) while attending school. He returned to film in the late 1980s and early 1990s and began to prove himself in adult roles, most notably as the younger version of Anthony Perkins' Norman Bates character in ''[[Psycho IV: The Beginning]]''. His most prominent adult role to date was as \"Samuel Ludlow\" in ''[[Legends of the Fall]]'' (1994). In 2002, he starred as supporting character Johnny Sirocco in the [[Martin Scorsese]] historical fiction film ''[[Gangs of New York]]''. He is currently both an actor and musician and starred in the 2011 film ''[[The Last Ride (2011 film)|The Last Ride]]'' (2011) as musician [[Hank Williams Sr.]]\nIn the ABC drama, \"Betrayal,\" Thomas plays T.J. Karsten, the brain-damaged son of a powerful Chicago businessman (2013).\n\n===Music===\nThomas wrote songs, sang, and played guitar for the [[San Antonio, Texas]] band The Blue Heelers from the mid to late '90s. Although the band was never signed to a record label, its self-produced album ''Twister'' was warmly received and enjoyed statewide radio play. Moving to Los Angeles in 1998, the band dissolved, but Thomas continued to write and record songs. In 1998, his song \"Truckstop Coffee\" (recorded with the Blue Heelers) appeared on V2's soundtrack to the film ''[[Niagara, Niagara]]'' in which Thomas appeared. {{Citation needed|date=June 2012}} In 2003, Thomas worked with [[Nikki Sudden]] on the music for [[Mika Kaurism\u00e4ki]]'s film ''Honey Baby'', which featured four original songs written and performed by Thomas as the fictitious musician Tom Brackett. An album was in the works, but their collaboration ended when Sudden died in 2006. {{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}\n\n==Awards and honors==\n* [[VH1]]'s \"100 Greatest Kid Stars\"\n* 2005, ranked #4, [[E!]]'s \"50 Cutest Child Stars All Grown-up\"\n\n==Filmography==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+Film\n|-\n!
