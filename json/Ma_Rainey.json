April 26, 1886 \u2013 December 22, 1939)<ref name=OMO/> was one of the earliest known [[United States|American]] professional [[blues]] [[singers]] and one of the first generation of such singers to record.<ref name=southern>{{cite book|last=Southern|first=Eileen|authorlink=Eileen Southern|year=1997|title=The Music of Black Americans: A History|edition=3rd edition|publisher=W. W. Norton & Company|isbn=0-393-97141-4}}</ref> She was billed as [[List of people known as the father or mother of something|The Mother of the Blues]].\n\nShe began performing as a young teenager (between the ages of 12 and 14), and performed under the name Ma Rainey after she and Will Rainey were married in 1904. They toured with F.S. Wolcott's [[The Rabbit's Foot Company|Rabbit Foot Minstrels]] and later formed their own group called Rainey and Rainey, Assassinators of the Blues. From the time of her first recording in 1923 to five years later, Ma Rainey made over 100 recordings, including \"[[Boll Weevil (song)|Bo-weevil Blues]]\" (1923), \"Moonshine Blues\" (1923), \"[[See See Rider]]\" (1924), \"Black Bottom\" (1927), and \"Soon This Morning\" (1927).<ref name=Lieb>{{cite book|last=Lieb|first=Sandra|year=1983|title=Mother of the Blues: A Study of Ma Rainey|edition=3rd|publisher=University of Massachusetts Press|isbn=0-87023-394-7}}</ref>\n\nMa Rainey was known for her very powerful vocal abilities, energetic disposition, majestic phrasing, and a \u2018moaning\u2019 style of singing similar to folk tradition. Her powerful voice was never adequately captured on her records, due to her recording exclusively for [[Paramount Records|Paramount]], which was at the time known for its below-average recording techniques and poor shellac quality. However, Rainey's other qualities are present and most evident in her early recordings, ''Bo-weevil Blues'' and ''Moonshine Blues''. \n\nRainey recorded with Louis Armstrong in addition to touring and recording with the Georgia Jazz Band. She continued to tour until 1935 when she retired to her hometown.<ref name=OMO />\n\n==Biography==\n'''Gertrude Pridgett''' claimed to have been born on April 26, 1886 in [[Columbus, Georgia]].<ref name=Lieb2/> (This can be questioned, however, as the 1900 census listing indicates she may have been born in September 1882 in [[Alabama]].<ref name=1900Census/>) She was the second of five children of Thomas and Ella (n\u00e9e Allen) Pridgett, from [[Alabama]]. She had at least two brothers and a sister named Malissa, with whom Gertrude was later confused in some sources.<ref name=Lieb2/> \n\nShe came onto the performance scene at a talent show in [[Columbus, Georgia]] when she was 12\u201314 years old.<ref name=OMO/><ref name=Lieb3/> A member of the [[First African Baptist Church (Columbus, Georgia)|First African Baptist Church]], she began performing in show tents. They sang and danced together in Black [[minstrel show]]s, and for several years toured with F.S. Wolcott's [[The Rabbit's Foot Company|Rabbit Foot Minstrels]].<ref name=OMO/> Around 1902 she was first exposed to blues music. From 1914, the Raineys were billed as Rainey and Rainey, Assassinators of the Blues. Wintering in [[New Orleans]], she met musicians including [[Joe \"King\" Oliver]], [[Louis Armstrong]], [[Sidney Bechet]] and [[Pops Foster]]. Blues music increased in popularity and Ma Rainey became well known.<ref name=Lieb5/>\n\nAround this time, Rainey met [[Bessie Smith]], a young blues singer who was also making a name for herself.{{Cref2|A}} A story later developed that Rainey kidnapped Smith, making her join the Rabbit Foot Minstrels, and teaching her to sing the blues. This was disputed by Smith's sister-in-law Maud Smith.<ref name=Lieb15/> From the late 1910s, there was an increasing demand for recordings by black musicians.<ref name=Lieb19/> In 1920, [[Mamie Smith]] was the first black woman to record a record.<ref name=Lieb20/> In 1923, Rainey was discovered by [[Paramount Records]] producer [[J. Mayo Williams]]. She signed a recording contract with Paramount, and in December she made her first eight recordings in [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]].<ref name=Lieb21/> These included the songs \"Bad Luck Blues\", \"Bo-Weevil Blues\" and \"Moonshine Blues\". She made more than 100 more over the next five years, which brought her fame beyond the South.<ref name=OMO/><ref name=Lieb23/>\n\nParamount marketed her extensively, calling her \"the Mother of the Blues\", \"the Songbird of the South\", \"the Gold-Neck Woman of the Blues\" and \"the Paramount Wildcat\".<ref name=Lieb25/> In 1924 she made some recordings with [[Louis Armstrong]], including \"Jelly Bean Blues\", \"Countin' the Blues\" and \"See, See Rider\".<ref name=Lieb26/> In 1924 she embarked on a tour of the [[Theater Owners Booking Association]] (TOBA) throughout the South and [[Midwestern United States]], singing both for black and white audiences.<ref name=Lieb27/> She was accompanied by bandleader and pianist [[Thomas A. Dorsey|Thomas Dorsey]], and the band he assembled called the Wildcats Jazz Band.<ref name=Lieb28/> They began their tour with an appearance in Chicago in April 1924 and continued, on and off, until 1928.<ref name=Lieb35/> Dorsey left the group in 1926 due to ill health and was replaced as pianist by Lillian Hardaway Henderson, the wife of Rainey's [[cornet]]ist Fletcher Henderson, who became the band's leader.<ref name=Lieb37/>\n\nSome of Rainey's lyrics contain open references to lesbianism or bisexuality. For example, a 1928 song, \"Prove It on Me\", states:<blockquote>''They said I do it, ain't nobody caught me. Sure got to prove it on me. Went out last night with a crowd of my friends. They must've been women, cause I don't like no men.''<ref>{{cite book|title=Sexuality and the Sacred: Sources for Theological Reflection|page=54|author=Kelly Brown Douglas|editor=Marvin Mahan Ellison}}</ref></blockquote> \n\nAccording to the website queerculturalcenter.org, the lyrics refer to an incident in 1925 in which Rainey was ''\"arrested for taking part in an orgy at [her] home involving women in her chorus.\"''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.queerculturalcenter.org/Pages/Bentley/QueersinJazz.html|publisher=queerculturalcenter.org|title=Gladys Bentley|accessdate=December 22, 2013}}</ref> \"Prove It on Me\" further alludes to presumed lesbian behavior, ''\"It's true I wear a collar and a tie...
