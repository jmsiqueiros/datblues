He began to perform at local nightclubs  with musicians such as [[Memphis Minnie]], [[Big Maceo Merriweather]], and [[Muddy Waters]], and became an important part of the city's blues scene.<ref name=lunet /><ref name=jazz>{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.allaboutjazz.com/php/musician.php?id=8690 |title=J.B.

He became an influential electric guitarist and songwriter, and his penchant for social commentary distinguished him from many other bluesmen of the time.<ref name=amg /> His most commercially successful and enduring release was \"Mamma Talk To Your Daughter\", recorded for Parrot in 1954 which reached #11 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs|R&B]] chart and was later recorded by many other blues and rock musicians.<ref name=Williamson /> In the later 1950s (recording on the Checker label), he wrote several more blues standards including; \"Don't Dog Your Woman\", and \"Don't Touch My Head!!!\" (1956). \n\nIn 1963, Lenoir recorded for USA Records as 'J. B. Lenoir and his African Hunch Rhythm', developing an interest in African percussion.<ref name=amg/>  However, he struggled to work as a professional musician and for a time took menial jobs, including working in the kitchen at the [[University of Illinois]] in [[Champaign, Illinois|Champaign]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} Lenoir was rediscovered by [[Willie Dixon]], who recorded him with drummer [[Fred Below]] on the albums ''Alabama Blues'' and ''Down In Mississippi'' (inspired by the [[African-American Civil Rights Movement (1955-1968)|Civil Rights]] and [[Free Speech Movement|Free Speech]] movements).<ref name=amg/> Lenoir toured Europe, and performed in 1965 with the [[American Folk Blues Festival]] in the United Kingdom.<ref name=\"russell\">{{cite book\n| first= Tony\n| last= Russell\n| year= 1997\n| title= The Blues: From Robert Johnson to Robert Cray\n| edition= \n| publisher= Carlton Books Limited \n| location= Dubai\n| pages= 133\u2013134\n| isbn= 1-85868-255-X}}</ref>\n\nLenoir's work had direct political content relating to racism and the [[Vietnam War]].\n\n{{Rquote|right|I never will go back to Alabama, that is not the place for me,\nI never will go back to Alabama, that is not the place for me,<br/>\nYou know they killed my sister and my brother,<br/>\nAnd the whole world let them peoples go down there free.|\"Alabama Blues\", by J.
