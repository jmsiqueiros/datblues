Synthesising influences from [[Chicago blues]] and leading blues guitarists such as [[Buddy Guy]], [[Freddie King]], and [[B. B. King]], Clapton forged a distinctive style and rapidly became one of the most talked-about guitarists in the British music scene.<ref name=\"unuhsh\">Romanowski, Patricia (2003)</ref> The band initially played [[Chess Records|Chess]]/[[Checker Records|Checker]]/[[Vee-Jay Records|Vee-Jay]] blues numbers and began to attract a large [[cult following]] when they took over the [[Rolling Stones]]' residency at the [[Crawdaddy Club]] in [[Richmond, London|Richmond]]. They toured England with American bluesman [[Sonny Boy Williamson II]]; a joint LP album, recorded in December 1963, was issued in 1965.\n\n[[File:Royal Albert Hall, London.jpg|thumb|Since appearing at the [[Royal Albert Hall]] for the first time in 1964, Clapton has performed at the venue almost 200 times.]]\nIt was during this time period that Clapton's Yardbirds rhythm guitarist, [[Chris Dreja]], recalled that whenever Clapton broke a guitar string during a concert, he would stay on stage and replace it. The English audiences would wait out the delay by doing what is called a \"[[Slow clap|slow handclap]]\". Clapton told his official biographer, Ray Coleman, that, \"My nickname of 'Slowhand' came from [[Giorgio Gomelsky]]. He coined it as a good pun. He kept saying I was a fast player, so he put together the slow handclap phrase into Slowhand as a play on words\".<ref>{{cite web|title= Where's Eric?|accessdate=11 October 2007|url=http://www.whereseric.com/ecfaq/biography-ecs-life-career/slowhand-nickname.html |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070927223253/http://www.whereseric.com/ecfaq/biography-ecs-life-career/slowhand-nickname.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 27 September 2007}}</ref> In December 1964, Clapton made his first appearance at the [[Royal Albert Hall]], London with The Yardbirds.

The Yardbirds elected to move toward a pop-oriented sound, in part because of the success of \"For Your Love\", written by pop songwriter-for-hire [[Graham Gouldman]] (who would achieve success as a member of [[10cc]]), who had also written hit songs for [[Herman's Hermits]] and [[The Hollies]]. Still musically devoted to the blues, Clapton was opposed to the move, and left the band. He recommended fellow guitarist [[Jimmy Page]] as his replacement, but Page declined out of loyalty to Clapton,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iem.ac.ru/zeppelin/docs/interviews/page_77.trp |title=Trouser Press : Jimmy Page interview transcript |publisher=Iem.ac.ru |accessdate=2014-04-17}}</ref> putting [[Jeff Beck]] forward.<ref name=\"unuhsh\"/> While Beck and Page played together in the Yardbirds, the trio of Beck, Page, and Clapton were never in the group together. However, the trio did appear on the 12-date benefit tour for ''Action for Research into [[Multiple Sclerosis]]'' in 1983.\n\nClapton joined [[John Mayall & the Bluesbreakers]] in April 1965, only to quit a few months later. In the summer of 1965 he left for Greece with a band called The Glands, which included his old friend Ben Palmer on piano. In November 1965 he rejoined John Mayall. During his second Bluesbreakers stint, Clapton gained a reputation as the best blues guitarist on the club circuit. Although Clapton gained world fame for his playing on the influential album, ''[[Blues Breakers with Eric Clapton|Blues Breakers \u2013 John Mayall \u2013 With Eric Clapton]]'', this album was not released until he had left the band for the last time. Having swapped his [[Fender Telecaster]] and [[Vox AC30]] amplifier for a 1960 [[Gibson Les Paul|Gibson Les Paul Standard]] guitar and [[Marshall Amplification|Marshall amplifier]], Clapton's sound and playing inspired a well-publicised [[graffiti|graffito]] that [[Honorific nicknames in popular music|deified him]] with the famous [[slogan]] \"Clapton is God\". The phrase was spray-painted by an admirer on a wall in an [[London Borough of Islington|Islington]] [[London Underground|Underground]] station in the autumn of 1967. The graffiti was captured in a now-famous photograph, in which a dog is [[Urinating dog|urinating on the wall]]. Clapton is reported to have been embarrassed by the slogan, saying in his ''[[The South Bank Show]]'' profile in 1987, \"I never accepted that I was the greatest guitar player in the world. I always ''wanted'' to be the greatest guitar player in the world, but that's an ideal, and I accept it as an ideal\". The phrase began to appear in other areas of Islington throughout the mid-1960s.<ref>{{cite web|title=Where's Eric Website: Nickname|accessdate=17 February 2007|url=http://www.whereseric.com/ecfaq/biography-ecs-life-career/clapton-is-god-graffiti-nickname.html |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070126080239/http://www.whereseric.com/ecfaq/biography-ecs-life-career/clapton-is-god-graffiti-nickname.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 26 January 2007}}</ref>\n\n===Cream===\n{{Main|Cream (band)}}\n\nClapton left the Bluesbreakers in July 1966 (to be replaced by [[Peter Green (musician)|Peter Green]]) and was invited by drummer [[Ginger Baker]] to play in his newly formed band Cream, one of the earliest [[Supergroup (bands)|supergroups]], with [[Jack Bruce]] on bass (previously of the Bluesbreakers, the [[Graham Bond|Graham Bond Organisation]] and [[Manfred Mann]]). Before the formation of Cream, Clapton was not well known in the United States; he left the Yardbirds before \"For Your Love\" hit the [[Billboard Hot 100|American Top Ten]], and had yet to perform there.<ref>{{cite web|last=Unterberger |first=Richie |url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p3983|pure_url=yes}} |title=Cream |publisher=Allmusic |accessdate=22 August 2010}}</ref> During his time with Cream, Clapton began to develop as a singer, songwriter, and guitarist, though Bruce took most of the lead vocals and wrote the majority of the material with lyricist [[Pete Brown]].<ref name=\"unuhsh\"/> Cream's first gig was an unofficial performance at the [[Twisted Wheel Club]] in Manchester on {{j|29 July}} 1966 before their full debut two nights later at the [[National Jazz and Blues Festival]] in [[Windsor, Berkshire|Windsor]]. Cream established its enduring legend with the high-volume blues jamming and extended solos of their live shows.\n\n[[File:Cream Clapton Bruce Baker 1960s.jpg|thumb|left|Clapton (right) with Cream]]\nBy early 1967, as fans of the emerging blues-rock sound in Britain had begun to portray Clapton as Britain's top guitarist; however, he found himself rivalled by the emergence of [[Jimi Hendrix]], an [[acid rock]]-infused guitarist who used wailing [[audio feedback|feedback]] and [[Effects unit|effects pedals]] to create new sounds for the instrument. Hendrix attended a performance of the newly formed Cream at the [[University of Westminster|Central London Polytechnic]] on {{j|1 October}} 1966, during which Hendrix sat in on a double-timed version of \"[[Killing Floor (Howlin' Wolf song)|Killing Floor]]\". Top UK stars, including Clapton, [[Pete Townshend]], and members of [[The Rolling Stones]] and [[The Beatles]], avidly attended Hendrix's early club performances. Hendrix's arrival had an immediate and major effect on the next phase of Clapton's career, although Clapton continued to be recognised in UK music polls as the premier guitarist.\n\nClapton first visited the United States while touring with Cream. In March 1967, Cream performed a nine-show stand at the RKO Theater in New York. They recorded ''[[Disraeli Gears]]'' in New York from {{j|11\u201315 May}} 1967. Cream's repertoire varied from hard rock (\"[[I Feel Free]]\") to lengthy blues-based instrumental jams (\"[[Spoonful]]\"). ''Disraeli Gears'' featured Clapton's searing guitar lines, Bruce's soaring vocals and prominent, fluid bass playing, and Baker's powerful, polyrhythmic jazz-influenced drumming. Together, Cream's talents secured them as an influential [[power trio]].\n\n[[Image:The Fool guitar (replica).jpg|thumb|upright=.65|Clapton's [[The Fool (guitar)|The Fool guitar]] ''(replica shown)'', with its bright artwork and famous \"woman tone\", was symbolic of the 1960s psychedelic rock era.]]\n\nIn 28 months, Cream had become a commercial success, selling millions of records and playing throughout the U.S. and Europe. They redefined the instrumentalist's role in rock and were one of the first blues-rock bands to emphasise musical virtuosity and lengthy jazz-style improvisation sessions. Their U.S. hit singles include \"[[Sunshine of Your Love]]\" (#5, 1968), \"[[White Room]]\" (#6, 1968) and \"[[Crossroads (song)|Crossroads]]\" (#28, 1969) \u2013 a live version of [[Robert Johnson (musician)|Robert Johnson]]'s \"Cross Road Blues\". Though Cream was hailed as one of the greatest groups of its day, and the adulation of Clapton as a guitar legend reached new heights, the [[supergroup (music)|supergroup]] was short-lived. Drug and alcohol use escalated tension between the three members, and conflicts between Bruce and Baker eventually led to Cream's demise. A strongly critical ''Rolling Stone'' review of a concert of the group's second headlining U.S. tour was another significant factor in the trio's demise, and it affected Clapton profoundly.<ref>Welch, Chris: \"Cream\" (2000), page 131</ref>\n\nCream's farewell album, ''[[Goodbye (Cream album)|Goodbye]]'', featuring live performances recorded at [[The Forum (Inglewood, California)|The Forum]], Los Angeles, {{j|19 October}} 1968, was released shortly after Cream disbanded; it also featured the studio single \"[[Badge (song)|Badge]]\", co-written by Clapton and [[George Harrison]]. Clapton met Harrison and became friends with him after the Beatles shared a bill with the Clapton-era Yardbirds at the [[London Palladium]]. The close friendship between Clapton and Harrison resulted in Clapton playing on Harrison's \"[[While My Guitar Gently Weeps]]\" from the Beatles' ''[[The Beatles (album)|White Album]]'' (1968). Harrison also released his solo debut album, ''[[Wonderwall Music]]'', in 1968. It became the first of many Harrison solo records to feature Clapton on guitar. Clapton would go largely uncredited for his contributions to Harrison's albums due to contractual restraints. The pair would often play live together as each other's guest. A year after Harrison's death in 2001, Clapton helped organise a [[Concert for George|tribute concert]], for which he was musical director.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/3138096.stm Ex-Beatles at Harrison film tribute] BBC News (25 September 2003)</ref> In 1969, when The Beatles were recording/filming what became ''[[Let It Be (film)|Let It Be]]'', tensions became so acute that Harrison quit the group for several days, prompting the others to consider replacing him with Clapton, an idea that particularly appealed to [[John Lennon]], who was captured on tape saying that if: \"George doesn\u2019t come back by Monday or Tuesday, we ask Eric Clapton to play\", and that this would be congenial to Clapton in that The Beatles, unlike Cream, \"would give him full scope to play his guitar\".<ref name=\"wheres eric\">{{cite web|title=Eric Clapton and The Beatles: Was Clapton ever invited to join The Fab Four?|url=http://www.whereseric.com/the-vault/band-history-and-lineups/eric-clapton-and-beatles-was-clapton-ever-invited-join-fab-four|publisher=Where's Eric! Magazine|accessdate=4 October 2013}}</ref> Years later, Clapton commented on the absurdity of this idea: \"There may have been [a suggestion that I would be asked to join The Beatles in January 1969]. The problem with that was I had bonded or was developing a relationship with George, exclusive of them. I think it fitted a need of his and mine, that he could elevate himself by having this guy that could be like a gunslinger to them. Lennon would use my name every now and then for clout, as if I was the fastest gun. So, I don\u2019t think I could have been brought into the whole thing because I was too much a mate of George\u2019s\".<ref name=\"wheres eric\" />\n\nCream briefly reunited in 1993 to perform at the ceremony inducting them into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]]; a full reunion took place in May 2005, with Clapton, Bruce, and Baker playing four sold-out concerts at London's [[Royal Albert Hall]],<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=rRQEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA62&dq=cream+2005+royal+albert+hall&hl=en&ei=6lgcTfznBaKShAe9uv22Dg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=9&ved=0CFMQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&q=cream%202005%20royal%20albert%20hall&f=false Billboard 23 July 2005] ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' Retrieved 30 December 2010</ref> and three shows at New York's [[Madison Square Garden]] that October.<ref>[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/10/25/AR2005102501667.html Cream, Rising to the Occasion at Madison Square Garden] ''[[The Washington Post]]'' Retrieved 30 December 2010</ref> Recordings from the London shows, ''[[Royal Albert Hall London May 2-3-5-6, 2005]]'', were released on CD, LP, and DVD in September/December 2005.<ref>{{cite web |url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=royal-albert-hall-london-may-2-3-5-6-2005-main-entry-r794100|pure_url=yes}} |title=Royal Albert Hall: London May&nbsp;2\u20133\u20135\u20136 2005 |author=Stephen Thomas Erlewine |authorlink=Stephen Thomas Erlewine |publisher=[[Allmusic]]  |accessdate=30 December 2010 }}</ref>\n\n===Blind Faith, and Delaney and Bonnie and Friends===\n{{Main|Blind Faith|Delaney and Bonnie and Friends}}\nClapton's next group, [[Blind Faith]] (1969), was composed of Cream drummer [[Ginger Baker]], [[Steve Winwood]] of [[Traffic (band)|Traffic]], and [[Ric Grech]] of [[Family (band)|Family]], and yielded one LP and one arena-circuit tour.

During this busy period, Clapton also recorded with other artists including Dr. John, [[Leon Russell]], Plastic Ono Band, [[Billy Preston]], [[Stephen Stills]], [[Ringo Starr]] and [[Dave Mason]].\n\nOther notable recordings from this period include Clapton's guitar work on \"Go Back Home\" from [[Stephen Stills]]' [[Stephen Stills (album)|self-titled first solo album]].\n\n==\"Layla\" and solo career==\n\n===Derek and the Dominos===\n{{Main|Derek and the Dominos}}\n{{listen\n | filename = Layla sample 1.ogg\n | title = \"Layla\"\n | description = 27-second sample of the song \"[[Layla]]\", as performed by Derek and the Dominos\n | format = [[Ogg]]\n}}\nWith the intention of counteracting the \"star\" cult faction that had begun to form around him, Clapton assembled a new band composed of Delaney and Bonnie's former [[rhythm section]], [[Bobby Whitlock]] as keyboardist and vocalist, [[Carl Radle]] as the bassist, and drummer [[Jim Gordon (musician)|Jim Gordon]], with Clapton playing guitar. It was his intention to show that he need not fill a starring role, and functioned well as a member of an ensemble.<ref>''[[The Layla Sessions]]'' liner notes, page 4.</ref> During this period, Clapton was increasingly influenced by [[The Band]] and their album ''[[Music from Big Pink]]'', saying, \"What I appreciated about The Band was that they were more concerned with songs and singing. They would have three- and four-part harmonies, and the guitar was put back into perspective as being accompaniment. That suited me well, because I had gotten so tired of the virtuosity\u2014or ''pseudo''-virtuosity\u2014thing of long, boring guitar solos just because they were expected. The Band brought things back into perspective. The priority was the song\".<ref>{{cite journal|last=Fox|first=Darrin|title=Guitar Player magazine|date=June 2001|page=108}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Derek and the Dominos.png|thumb|left|Clapton (right) with Derek and the Dominos]]\nThe band was originally called \"Eric Clapton and Friends\". The name \"Derek and the Dominos\" was a fluke that occurred when the band's provisional name of \"Del and the Dynamos\" was misread as Derek and the Dominos.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.artistfacts.com/detail.php?id=100|work=Artistfacts | title =Derek And The Dominoes|accessdate=17 February 2007}}</ref> Clapton's biography states that Tony Ashton of [[Ashton, Gardner and Dyke]] told Clapton to call the band \"Del and the Dominos\", since \"Del\" was his nickname for Eric Clapton. Del and Eric were combined and the final name became \"Derek and the Dominos\".<ref name = \"nxfddy\">Schumacher, Michael (1992)</ref>\n\nClapton's close friendship with George Harrison brought him into contact with Harrison's wife, [[Pattie Boyd]], with whom he became deeply infatuated. When she spurned his advances, Clapton's unrequited affections prompted most of the material for the Dominos' album, ''[[Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs]]'' (1970). Heavily blues-influenced, the album features the twin lead guitars of Duane Allman and Clapton, with Allman's [[slide guitar]] as a key ingredient of the sound. Working at [[Criteria Studios]] in Miami with [[Atlantic Records]] producer [[Tom Dowd]], who had worked with Clapton on Cream's ''Disraeli Gears'', the band recorded a double album.\n\nThe album features the hit love song \"[[Layla]]\", inspired by the classical poet of [[Persian literature]], [[Nizami Ganjavi]]'s ''[[Layla and Majnun|The Story of Layla and Majnun]]'', a copy of which [[Ian Dallas]] had given to Clapton. The book moved Clapton profoundly, as it was the tale of a young man who fell hopelessly in love with a beautiful, unavailable woman and who went crazy because he could not marry her.<ref>{{Cite book|first=William |last=McKeen |title=Rock and roll is here to stay: an anthology |publisher=W.

A few days into the Layla sessions, Dowd\u2014who was also producing the Allmans\u2014invited Clapton to an Allman Brothers outdoor concert in Miami. The two guitarists met first on stage, then played all night in the studio, and became friends. Duane first added his [[slide guitar]] to \"[[Tell the Truth (song)|Tell the Truth]]\" and \"[[Nobody Knows You When You're Down and Out]]\". In four days, the five-piece Dominos recorded \"[[Key to the Highway]]\", \"[[Have You Ever Loved a Woman]]\" (a [[blues standard]] popularised by [[Freddie King]] and others), and \"Why Does Love Got to be So Sad\". In September, Duane briefly left the sessions for gigs with his own band, and the four-piece Dominos recorded \"I Looked Away\", \"[[Bell Bottom Blues (Derek and the Dominos song)|Bell Bottom Blues]]\", and \"Keep on Growing\". Duane returned to record \"I am Yours\", \"Anyday\", and \"It's Too Late\". On 9 September, they recorded Hendrix's \"[[Little Wing]]\" and the title track. The following day, the final track, \"It's Too Late\", was recorded.<ref>\"[[The Layla Sessions]]\" CD liner notes.</ref>\n\n[[File:Eric \"slowhand\" Clapton.jpg|thumb|right|Eric Clapton in [[Barcelona]], 1974]]\nTragedy dogged the group throughout its brief career. During the sessions, Clapton was devastated by news of the death of Jimi Hendrix; eight days previously the band had cut a cover of \"Little Wing\" as a tribute to Hendrix. On {{j|17 September}} 1970, one day before Hendrix's death, Clapton had purchased a [[Left-handedness|left-handed]] [[Fender Stratocaster]] that he had planned to give to Hendrix as a birthday gift. Adding to Clapton's woes, the ''Layla'' album received only lukewarm reviews upon release. The shaken group undertook a U.S. tour without Allman, who had returned to the Allman Brothers Band. Despite Clapton's later admission that the tour took place amidst a veritable blizzard of drugs and alcohol, it resulted in the live double album ''[[In Concert (Derek and the Dominos album)|In Concert]]''.<ref>''[[The Layla Sessions]]'' liner notes, page 12.</ref> The band had recorded several tracks for a second album in London during the spring of 1971 (five of which were released on the Eric Clapton box-set ''Crossroads''), but the results were mediocre.\n\nA second record was in the works when a clashing of egos took place and Clapton walked, thus disbanding the group. Allman was killed in a motorcycle accident on {{j|29 October}} 1971. Clapton wrote later in his autobiography that he and Allman were inseparable during the sessions in Florida; he talked about Allman as the \"musical brother I'd never had but wished I did\".<ref>Clapton, ''The Autobiography'', 128.</ref> Although Radle would remain Clapton's bass player until the summer of 1979 (Radle died in May 1980 from the effects of alcohol and narcotics), it would be 2003 before Clapton and Whitlock appeared together again (Clapton guested on Whitlock's appearance on the ''[[Later with Jools Holland]]'' show). Another tragic footnote to the Dominos story was the fate of drummer [[Jim Gordon (musician)|Jim Gordon]], who was an undiagnosed [[schizophrenia|schizophrenic]] and years later murdered his mother during a [[Psychosis|psychotic episode]]. Gordon was confined to 16-years-to-life imprisonment, later being moved to a mental institution, where he remains today.<ref name=\"unuhsh\"/>\n\n===Personal challenges and early solo success===\nClapton's career successes in the 1970s were in stark contrast with the struggles he coped with in his personal life, which was troubled by romantic longings and drug and alcohol addiction.<ref>Marc Roberty, Chris Charlesworth (1995) [http://books.google.com/books?id=qpvlUrpH_xoC&pg=PA67&dq=eric+clapton+DRUGS+1970s&hl=en&ei=0K0aTdy1DMiAhQeRqaC4Dg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=4&ved=0CDwQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&q&f=false The complete guide to the music of Eric Clapton] p.67. Omnibus Press, 1995</ref> He became infatuated with Pattie Boyd, who at the time was married to close friend [[George Harrison]], he withdrew from recording and touring as the band broke up to isolation in his Surrey, England, residence. There he nursed a [[Substance abuse|heroin addiction]], which resulted in a lengthy career hiatus interrupted only by the [[Concert for Bangladesh]] in August 1971 (where he passed out on stage, was revived, and managed to finish his performance).<ref name=\"unuhsh\"/> In January 1973, [[The Who]]'s [[Pete Townshend]] organised a comeback concert for Clapton at London's [[Rainbow Theatre]], aptly titled the \"[[Eric Clapton's Rainbow Concert|Rainbow Concert]]\", to help Clapton kick his addiction. Clapton would return the favour by playing 'The Preacher' in [[Tommy (1975 film)|Ken Russell's film version]] of The Who's ''[[Tommy (rock opera)|Tommy]]'' in 1975; his appearance in the film (performing \"Eyesight to the Blind\") is notable as he is clearly wearing a fake beard in some shots, the result of deciding to shave off his real beard after the initial takes in an attempt to force the director to remove his earlier scene from the movie and leave the set.<ref name = \"nxfddy\"/>\n\n[[File:Clapton and Elliman.jpg|thumb|[[Yvonne Elliman]] with Clapton promoting ''[[461 Ocean Boulevard]]'' in 1975]]\nIn 1974, Clapton was partnered with Pattie Boyd (they would not actually marry until 1979) and no longer using heroin (although he gradually began to drink heavily). He assembled a low-key touring band that included Radle, Miami guitarist [[George Terry]], keyboardist Dick Sims (who died in 2011<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gibson.com/en-us/Lifestyle/News/dick-sims-death-1209-2011/ |title=Longtime Eric Clapton Keyboardist Dick Sims Dies |publisher=Gibson.com |date=24 June 2008 |accessdate=30 December 2011}}</ref>), drummer [[Jamie Oldaker]], and vocalists [[Yvonne Elliman]] and [[Marcy Levy]] (also known as Marcella Detroit). With this band Clapton recorded ''[[461 Ocean Boulevard]]'' (1974), an album with an emphasis on more compact songs and fewer guitar solos; the cover version of \"[[I Shot The Sheriff]]\" was Clapton's first No.&nbsp;1 hit and was important in bringing [[reggae]] and the music of [[Bob Marley]] to a wider audience. The 1975 album ''[[There's One in Every Crowd]]'' continued this trend. The album's original title, ''The World's Greatest Guitar Player (There's One in Every Crowd)'', was changed before pressing, as it was felt its ironic intention would be misunderstood. The band toured the world and subsequently released the 1975 live LP, ''[[E.C. Was Here]]''.<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=60Jde3l7WNwC&pg=PA70&dq=E.C.+Was+Here+released+in+1975&hl=en&ei=0LIaTdPiGs2FhQfm4924Dg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CDAQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=E.C.%20Was%20Here%20released%20in%201975&f=false Legends of rock guitar: the essential reference of rock's greatest guitarists] p.70. Hal Leonard Corporation, 1997</ref> Clapton continued to release albums and toured regularly. Highlights of the period include ''[[No Reason to Cry]]'' (a collaboration with [[Bob Dylan]] and [[The Band]]); ''[[Slowhand]]'', which featured \"[[Wonderful Tonight]] and a second JJ Cale cover, \"[[Cocaine (song)|Cocaine]]\". In 1976 he performed, alongside a string of notable guests, to pay tribute to the farewell performance of The Band, filmed in a [[Martin Scorsese]] documentary called ''[[The Last Waltz]]''.\n\n==Continued success==\nIn 1981 Clapton was invited by producer [[Martin Lewis (humorist)|Martin Lewis]] to appear at the [[Amnesty International]] benefit ''[[The Secret Policeman's Other Ball]]''. Clapton accepted the invitation and teamed up with Jeff Beck to perform a series of duets\u2014reportedly their first-ever billed stage collaboration. Three of the performances were released on the album of the show, and one of the songs was featured in the film. The performances heralded a return to form and prominence for Clapton in the new decade. Many factors had influenced Clapton's comeback, including his \"deepening commitment to Christianity\", to which he had converted prior to his heroin addiction.<ref>Conversations with Eric Clapton, Steve Turner</ref><ref>Moritz, Charles (1987)</ref><ref name=\"amg\">{{cite web| url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p64692|pure_url=yes}} |publisher=Allmusic | accessdate=17 February 2007 | title = Eric Clapton | first = William | last = Ruhlmann}}</ref>\n\nAfter an embarrassing fishing incident, Clapton finally called his manager and admitted he was an alcoholic. In January 1982 Roger and Clapton flew to [[Minneapolis \u2013 St. Paul]]; Clapton would be checked in at [[Hazelden Foundation|Hazelden Treatment Center]], located in [[Center City, Minnesota]]. On the flight over, Clapton indulged in a large number of drinks, for fear he would never be able to drink again. Clapton is quoted as saying from his autobiography, \"In the lowest moments of my life, the only reason I didn't commit suicide was that I knew I wouldn't be able to drink any more if I was dead. It was the only thing I thought was worth living for, and the idea that people were about to try and remove me from alcohol was so terrible that I drank and drank and drank, and they had to practically carry me into the clinic\".<ref>{{cite book|author=Clapton, Eric|title = Clapton, The Autobiography|date= 2007 and 2008|publisher= Broadway Books|page=198}}</ref>\n\n[[File:TinaTurner&Clapton.jpg|thumb|[[Tina Turner]] and Eric Clapton at [[Wembley Arena]], {{j|18 June}} 1987]]\nAfter being discharged, it was recommended by doctors of Hazelden that Clapton not partake in any activities that would act as triggers for his alcoholism or stress, until he was fully situated back at Hurtwood. A few months after his discharge, Clapton began working on his next album, against the Hazelden doctors' orders. Working with Tom Dowd, Clapton produced what he thought as his \"most forced\" album to date, ''[[Money and Cigarettes]]''.\n\nIn 1984 he performed on [[Pink Floyd]] member [[Roger Waters]]' solo album, ''[[The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking]]'', and went on tour with Waters following the release of the album. Since then Waters and Clapton have had a close relationship. In 2005 they performed together for the Tsunami Relief Fund. In 2006 they performed at the Highclere Castle, in aid of the Countryside Alliance, playing two set pieces of \"[[Wish You Were Here (Pink Floyd song)|Wish You Were Here]]\" and \"[[Comfortably Numb]]\". Clapton, now a seasoned charity performer, played at the [[Live Aid]] concert on 13 July 1985.<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=60Jde3l7WNwC&pg=PA69&dq=eric+clapton+live+aid&hl=en&sa=X&ei=-LyWT5iJO6fB0QWP9cS6Dg&ved=0CGQQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&q=eric%20clapton%20live%20aid&f=false Legends of Rock Guitar: The Essential Reference of Rock's Greatest Guitarists] p.69. Hal Leonard Corporation, 1 March 1997</ref> When offered a slot close to peak viewing hours, he was apparently flattered. As Clapton recovered from his addictions, his album output continued in the 1980s, including two produced with [[Phil Collins]], 1985's ''[[Behind the Sun (Eric Clapton album)|Behind the Sun]]'', which produced the hits \"Forever Man\" and \"She's Waiting\", and 1986's ''[[August (Eric Clapton album)|August]]''.\n\n[[File:Harrison and Clapton.jpg|thumb|left|[[George Harrison]] and Clapton at the [[Prince's Trust]] Concert, [[Wembley Arena]], 1987]]\n''August'' was suffused with Collins's trademark drum and horn sound, and became Clapton's biggest seller in the UK to date, matching his highest chart position, number 3. The album's first track, the hit \"It's in the Way That You Use It\", was featured in the [[Tom Cruise]] \u2013 [[Paul Newman]] movie ''[[The Color of Money]].'' The horn-peppered \"Run\" echoed Collins' \"Sussudio\" and rest of the producer's Genesis/solo output, while \"Tearing Us Apart\" (with [[Tina Turner]]) and the unimpressed \"Miss You\" echoed Clapton's angry sound. This rebound kicked off Clapton's two-year period of touring with Collins and their ''August'' collaborates, bassist [[Nathan East]] and keyboard player/songwriter Greg Phillinganes. While on tour for ''August'', two concert videos were recorded of the four-man band, ''Eric Clapton Live from Montreux'' and ''Eric Clapton and Friends''. Clapton later remade \"After Midnight\" as a single and a promotional track for the [[Michelob]] beer brand, which had also marketed earlier songs by Collins and [[Steve Winwood]]. Clapton won a [[British Academy Television Award]] for his collaboration with [[Michael Kamen]] on the score for the 1985 [[BBC Television]] thriller serial ''[[Edge of Darkness]]''. In 1989, Clapton released ''[[Journeyman (album)|Journeyman]]'', an album which covered a wide range of styles including blues, jazz, soul and pop.

All proceeds from the auction were donated to Clapton's Crossroads drug and rehabilitation centre in Antigua.\n\n==Woman tone==\nThe \"woman tone\" is the informal term used by Clapton to refer to his distinctive mid- to late-1960s electric guitar sound, created using his [[Gibson SG]] solid body guitar (with [[Humbucker]] pick-ups) and a [[Marshall Amplifiers|Marshall]] [[vacuum tube|tube]] amplifier.<ref>{{cite web|title=How to Get Clapton's Classic 'Woman Tone'|author= Ted Drozdowski|date= 9 January 2009|work=Lifestyle|publisher=Gibson.com|accessdate=6 August 2010|url=http://www.gibson.com/en-us/Lifestyle/ProductSpotlight/Tone-Tips/how-to-get-claptons-classic/}}</ref> It is an overdriven sound that is articulate yet thick. It is characterised by being quite distorted (or even achieved with a fuzz) but muted, in contrast to the bright and twangy distortion that most guitarists were using at the time.\n\nAmong the techniques used to replicate Clapton's sound is a technique by which the amplifier's volume is turned up to full, while the guitar's tone knob is turned down to zero or one.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rq6r23-le5o |title=Eric Clapton Shows Some Guitar Skills |publisher=YouTube |accessdate=22 August 2010}}</ref>\n\nPerhaps the best example of the \"woman tone\" is Clapton's famous riff and solo from Cream's 1967 hit \"[[Sunshine of Your Love]]\". Clapton has explained that he obtained the tone with his Gibson's tone control rolled all the way down, switching the neck pick-up (closest to the fretboard) and the volume all the way up, with his distortion turned all the way up. The treble, mids and bass controls on the amplifier were also maxed out. Some versions of the \"woman tone\" may also have involved strategic positioning of Clapton's [[wah-wah pedal]]. {{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}\n\n==Other media appearances==\nClapton frequently appears as a guest on the albums of other musicians. For example, he is credited on [[Dire Straits]]{{'}}s ''[[Brothers in Arms (Dire Straits album)|Brothers in Arms]]'' album, as he lent [[Mark Knopfler]] one of his guitars. He played lead guitar and synthesiser on ''[[The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking]]'', [[Roger Waters]]' debut solo album. Other media appearances include the [[Toots & the Maytals]] album ''[[True Love (Toots & the Maytals album)|True Love]]'', where he played guitar on the track \"[[Pressure Drop (song)|Pressure Drop]]\". He played on [[Paul Brady]]'s 1985 album ''[[Back to the Centre]]'' on the track \"Deep in your Heart\". He can also be heard at the beginning of [[Frank Zappa]]'s album, ''[[We're Only in It for the Money]]'', repeating the phrase, \"Are you hung up?\" over and over again. In 1985, Clapton appeared on the charity concert [[Live Aid]] in [[Philadelphia]] with [[Phil Collins]], [[Tim Renwick]], [[Chris Stainton]], [[Jamie Oldaker]], [[Marcy Levy]], [[Shaun Murphy (singer)|Shaun Murphy]], and [[Donald 'Duck' Dunn]].
