D. \"Jay\" Miller]]. Miller, via the offices of [[Excello Records]], started Hogan's recording career, at a time when interest in variations of swamp blues was starting to wane. Hogan did nevertheless see the issue of several singles up to 1965, when Miller's disagreement with the record label's new owners brought the [[recording contract]] to a swift finale. On some of his recordings, Hogan was backed by the [[harmonica]] player, [[Moses \"Whispering\" Smith]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/trouble-mw0000850928/credits |title=Trouble - Silas Hogan &#124; Credits |publisher=AllMusic |date= |accessdate=2014-01-29}}</ref> Hogan had to disband the group, and returned to his full-time job at the [[ExxonMobile|Exxon]] [[oil refinery]].
