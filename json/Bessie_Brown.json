She sometimes recorded under the [[pseudonym]]s of Sadie Green, Caroline Lee, and possibly Helen Richards. Brown was active as a recording artist from 1925 to 1929. Her best known tracks were \"Ain't Much Good in the Best of Men Nowdays\" and \"Song from a Cotton Field\".\n\nShe should not be confused (although often is in both biographies and discographies) with her namesake, Bessie Brown, who recorded [[vaudeville]] and blues styled [[duet (music)|duets]] with George W. Williams, over a similar timespan.<ref>{{cite book\n| first= Colin\n| last= Larkin\n| year= 1995\n| title= The Guinness Encyclopedia of Popular Music, Volume 1\n| edition= 2nd\n| publisher= Guinness Publishing \n| location= London\n| isbn= 1-56159-176-9\n| page= 570}}</ref>\n\n==Life and career==\nBrown was born in [[Marysville, Ohio]], [[United States]]. She recorded between the dates of November 10, 1925 and April 1, 1929.  Her concurrent [[vaudeville]] career, saw her appear sometimes as a male impersonator.<ref name=\"Comp\"/> She also appeared in [[revue]]s including ''Moonshine Revue'', ''The Whirl Of Joy'' and ''Dark-Town Frolics''. In addition, Brown took to the stage as a cabaret performer, primarily on the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]].<ref name=\"Jazz\"/>  On her recordings she sang in a deepened tone, without any notable [[African American]] dialect.  Thus, to more than one commentator, her style was similar to [[Sophie Tucker]].<ref name=\"Comp\"/><ref>{{cite book\n| first= \u00c9lizabeth\n| last= Rechniewski\n| year= 2005\n| title= Sartre's Nausea: text, context, intertext\n| edition= 1st\n| publisher= Rodopi \n| location= New York, United States\n| isbn= 90-420-1928-X\n| page= 172}}</ref> \n\nHer recordings saw Brown backed by some of the best [[Harlem]] based musicians of the time.  These included [[Thomas Morris (musician)|Thomas Morris]] and [[Rex Stewart]] ([[cornet]]); [[Charlie Irvis]] and [[Charlie Green (musician)|Charlie Green]] ([[trombone]]); [[Coleman Hawkins]] and [[Buster Bailey]] ([[saxophone]]); Buddy Christian and [[Clarence Holiday]] ([[banjo]]); plus [[Porter Grainger]], [[Clarence Williams (musician)|Clarence Williams]] and [[Fletcher Henderson]] ([[piano]]).<ref name=\"Comp\"/>\n\nShe left the [[music industry]] in 1932,<ref name=\"Jazz\"/> and married Clarence Shaw in the early 1930s. She had three children, before dying of a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] in 1955.<ref name=\"Jazz\"/>\n\nThe bulk of her known recorded work, ''Complete Recorded Works (1925-29)'', was made available in 1996 by [[Document Records]]. Somewhat confusingly, the [[compilation album]] also included four October 1929 recordings by the unrelated comedienne, Eliza \"Liza\" Brown.<ref name=\"Comp\">{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r250577/credits|pure_url=yes}} |title=Allmusic ((( ''Complete Recorded Works (1925-29)'' > Review )))}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Persondata <!-- Metadata: see [[Wikipedia:Persondata]]. -->\n| NAME              = Brown, Bessie\n| ALTERNATIVE NAMES =\n| SHORT DESCRIPTION = [[United States|American]] [[classic female blues]], [[jazz]], and cabaret singer\n| DATE OF BIRTH     = 1890\n| PLACE OF BIRTH    = [[Cleveland, Ohio]], [[United States]]\n| DATE OF DEATH     = 1955\n| PLACE OF DEATH    =\n}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Brown, Bessie}}\n[[Category:1890 births]]\n[[Category:1955 deaths]]\n[[Category:Musicians from Cleveland, Ohio]]\n[[Category:African-American female singers]]\n[[Category:American blues singers]]\n[[Category:American jazz singers]]\n[[Category:Classic female blues singers]]\n[[Category:Deaths from myocardial infarction]]"}]}}}}
