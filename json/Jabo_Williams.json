However, this is based purely on references to that location, in his self-penned [[Sound recording and reproduction|recording]] of \"Pratt City Blues\".<ref name=\"AMG\"/> What is certain is that he relocated to [[St. Louis, Missouri]], and was recommended to [[Paramount Records]], by a  local [[record store]] owner and scout Jesse Johnson.<ref name=\"Blues\"/> In May 1932, Williams recorded eight tracks in a [[recording studio]] in [[Grafton, Wisconsin]], for the Paramount label. The timing was not fortuitous, as Paramount stopped recording that year, and went out of business in 1935. Consequently, Williams's output was limited in both national distribution and the number of issued [[Gramophone record|records]].<ref name=\"AMG\"/> His \"Kokomo Blues,\" followed previous recordings of a similar style with the same [[refrain]], but included the counting line;\n<blockquote>''One and two is three, four and five and six''<ref>\"Ko Ko Mo Blues\", Jabo Williams, Paramount PM 13127</ref></blockquote> This partly paved the way towards the better known song, \"[[Sweet Home Chicago]]\".\n\nBy the late 1940s and early 1950s, some of Williams tracks were re-issued on the [[American Music Records|American Music]] [[record label]], amongst others.  His playing style was somewhat unique, but such belated recognition failed to unearth Williams, whose life details remain a mystery.<ref name=\"AMG\"/>\n\nHe was recalled briefly by [[Henry Townsend (musician)|Henry Townsend]], who stated \"I knew him from down on Biddle Street and I played guitar behind him around town\". He added that Williams was \"an average guy and he was very entertaining... he disappeared from St. Louis and went down in Arkansas some place. I never knew what the hell happened to him.\"<ref>{{cite book\n| first= Henry\n| last= Townsend\n| year= 1999\n| title= A Blues Life\n| edition= 1st\n| publisher= University of Illinois Press \n| location= Urbana, Illinois\n| isbn=  0-252-02526-1\n| page= 62}}</ref> \n\n==Discography==\nHis total output consisted of the tracks, \"Fat Mama Blues\", \"House Lady Blues\", \"Jab's Blues\", \"Kokomo Blues\" Parts 1 and 2, \"My Woman Blues\", \"Polock Blues\", and \"Pratt City\tBlues\". All were included on the [[compilation album]], ''Boogie Woogie & Barrelhouse Piano, Vol. 1 (1928-1932)'', issued in 1992 by [[Document Records]].<ref>{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r163267/review|pure_url=yes}} |title=Allmusic ((( ''Boogie Woogie & Barrelhouse Piano, Vol. 1 (1928-1932)'' > Review )))}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of songs about Birmingham, Alabama]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.discogs.com/artist/Jabo+Williams Discography at Discogs.com]\n*[http://www.nme.com/nme-video/youtube/id/b8jETzJ8anQ/search/polack \"Polack Blues\" - 1932 single (Paramount 13130)]\n*[http://www.wirz.de/music/jamesfrm.htm Williams tracks on the Skip James discography at wirz.de]\n\n{{Persondata <!-- Metadata: see [[Wikipedia:Persondata]]. -->\n| NAME              = Williams, Jabo\n| ALTERNATIVE NAMES = \n| SHORT DESCRIPTION = American [[boogie-woogie]] style blues pianist\n| DATE OF BIRTH     = Unknown\n| PLACE OF BIRTH    = \n| DATE OF DEATH     = Unknown\n| PLACE OF DEATH    = \n}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Williams, Jabo}}\n[[Category:Year of birth missing]]\n[[Category:Place of birth missing]]\n[[Category:Year of death missing]]\n[[Category:Place of death missing]]\n[[Category:Boogie-woogie pianists]]\n[[Category:American blues pianists]]\n[[Category:African-American pianists]]\n[[Category:Songwriters from Alabama]]"}]}}}}
