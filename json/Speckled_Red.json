He was an [[United States|American]] [[blues]] and [[boogie-woogie]] [[pianist|piano player]] and [[singing|singer]],<ref name=\"Music\"/> most noted for his [[sound recording and reproduction|recordings]] of \"The [[Dirty Dozens]]\", with exchanges of insults and vulgar remarks that have long been a part of [[African American]] [[folklore]].\n\n:\"I want all you women to fall in line\"\n:\"And shake yo shimmy like i'm shakin' mine\"\n:\"You shake yo shimmy and you shake it fast\"\n:\"If you can't shake the shimmy, shake yo' yes yes yes\"\n\n:\"You a dirty mistreater, a robber and a cheater\"\n:\"Stick you in a dozens and yo pappy is yo cousin\"\n:\"And yo mama do the lawdylawd\"\n\nAlthough the lyrics were sung rather than spoken, with its elaborate [[word play]] and earthy subject matter, \"The Dirty Dozens\" is considered in some respects an ancestor to [[rap music]].\n\n==Life and career==\nSpeckled Red was the older brother of [[Piano Red]], their nicknames derived from both men being [[albino]]s.<ref>{{cite web | year=2005 | url=http://www.musicweb-international.com/encyclopaedia/s/S171.HTM| title=MusicWeb Encyclopaedia of Popular Music \u2013 Speckled Red| publisher=MusicWeb | accessdate=2008-03-27}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>  The brothers were separated by almost a generation and never recorded together.  Speckled Red and Piano Red both played in a raucous good time barrelhouse boogie-woogie style, although the elder Speckled Red played slow blues more often.  Both recorded versions of \"The Right String (But the Wrong Yo-Yo)\", Speckled Red first in 1930, and the younger scored a big hit with the song 20-years later.\n\nPrior to his birth the family had moved for brief periods to [[Detroit, Michigan]], then [[Atlanta, Georgia]] after his father violated Jim Crow laws, before settling in [[Hampton, Georgia]].  The family itself, consisting of Perryman and 7 brothers and sisters, had little musical background, though Speckled Red was a self-taught piano player<ref>{{cite web | year=0000 | url=http://www.learnlink.emory.edu/~libmlm/pianored.html| title=Piano Red | publisher=Leanlink | accessdate=2008-03-27}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> (influenced primarily by his idol Fishtail, along with [[Charlie Spand]], James Hemingway and [[William Ezell]], and inspired at his earliest point by Paul Seminole in a movie theatre) and also learned the organ at his local church.<ref>{{cite web | year=1997\u20132008 | url=http://www.artistdirect.com/nad/music/artist/bio/0,,495891,00.html#bio| title=Piano Red | publisher=artistdirect.com | accessdate=2008-03-27}}</ref>\n\nBy his mid-teens he was already playing house parties and juke joints, and moved back to Detroit in his mid-20s to play anywhere he could, including nightclubs and brothels, and was noticed by a Brunswick Records talent scout just before he left for [[Memphis, Tennessee]], where he was located by Jim Jackson.<ref>{{cite web | year=0000 | url=http://www.delmark.com/delmark.601.htm| title=Speckled Red \u2013 The Dirty Dozens | publisher=Delmark | accessdate=2008-03-27}}</ref>  It was here where he cut his first recording sessions, resulting in two classics for Brunswick in \"Wilkins Street Stomp\" and the hit \u201cThe Dirty Dozens\u201d.  The following year, 1930, he recorded again, this time in [[Chicago, Illinois]], resulting in most notably \u201cThe Dirty Dozens No. 2,\u201d which was not nearly as successful and the pianist was without a contract or label and again playing making the rounds at Memphis venues and St. Louis bars.\n\nHis 1938 session work in [[Aurora, Illinois]] with [[slide guitar]] player [[Robert Nighthawk]] and [[mandolinist]] Willie Hatcher for [[Bluebird Records]] was steady and long but also unsuccessful, and sometime after during the 1940s moved back to St. Louis and continued his career of playing taverns, as well working the public produce market doing manual labor until the servicemen returned home to heavy lifting jobs.\n\n==Revival and death==\nCharlie O'Brien, a St. Louis policeman and something of a blues aficionado who applied many of his professional investigative methods to track down old bluesmen during the 1950s, \"rediscovered\" Speckled Red on December 14, 1954, who subsequently was signed to [[Delmark Records]] as their first blues artist.  He experienced a small revival of interest in his music during the late 1950s and 1960s, his abilities still considerable, and worked around the St. Louis-area jazz scene, regularly as the intermission pianist for the Dixie Stompers, performing concerts with Dixie Mantinee and the St. Louis Jazz Club, played the University of Chicago Folk Festival in 1961, went to [[Dayton]], Ohio, with Gene Mayl's Dixieland Rhythm Kings, and toured Europe in 1959 with [[Chris Barber]].  Several recordings were made in 1956 and 1957 for Tone, Delmark, [[Folkways Records|Folkways]], and Storyville [[record label]]s.\n\nHis age, however, had become a factor, and the remainder of the 1960s saw scattered performances.  He died on January 2, 1973, of [[cancer]] in St. Louis, at the age of 80.<ref name=\"Dead\">[http://thedeadrockstarsclub.com/1970.html Thedeadrockstarsclub.com] - accessed October 25, 2011</ref>\n\n==Discography==\n*''The Dirty Dozens'' - Delmark Records\n*''The Barrel-House Blues of Speckled Red'' - [[Smithsonian Folkways Recordings]], 1961\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.answers.com/topic/speckled-red Answers.com page on Speckled Red]\n* [{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p7594/biography|pure_url=yes}} AllMusic biography]\n* [http://www.folkways.si.edu/albumdetails.aspx?itemid=420/ ''The Barrel-House Blues of Speckled Red'' Album Details] of [[Folkways Records]]\n* [http://www.allmusic.com/album/biddle-street-barrelhousin-r484687/review Biddle Street Barrelhousin'] review\n* [http://www.wirz.de/music/speckled.htm Illustrated Speckled Red discography]\n\n{{Authority control|VIAF=7579644}}\n\n{{Persondata <!-- Metadata: see [[Wikipedia:Persondata]]. -->\n| NAME              =Speckled Red\n| ALTERNATIVE NAMES =\n| SHORT DESCRIPTION =[[United States|American]] [[blues]] and [[boogie-woogie]] pianist and singer\n| DATE OF BIRTH     =October 23, 1892\n| PLACE OF BIRTH    =[[Monroe, Louisiana|Monroe]], [[Louisiana]], [[United States]]\n| DATE OF DEATH     =January 2, 1973\n| PLACE OF DEATH    =[[St. Louis, Missouri]], United States\n}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Speckled Red}}\n[[Category:1892 births]]\n[[Category:1973 deaths]]\n[[Category:People with albinism]]\n[[Category:American male singers]]\n[[Category:American blues singers]]\n[[Category:American blues musicians]]\n[[Category:American blues pianists]]\n[[Category:Boogie-woogie pianists]]\n[[Category:Jazz-blues pianists]]\n[[Category:People from Hampton, Georgia]]\n[[Category:Musicians from Georgia (U.S. state)]]\n[[Category:Cancer deaths in Missouri]]\n[[Category:St. Louis blues musicians]]\n[[Category:Delmark Records artists]]"}]}}}}
