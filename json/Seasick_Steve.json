It has an old [[Harmony Company|Harmony]] pickup added (with [[duct tape]]) and is [[Guitar tunings|tuned to G]], A and B using an E string in the A position, a D in the G position and a G in the B position. At his gigs, he often tells the story that he bought it for $75 in this condition in [[Como, Mississippi]], from a man named Sherman, who later told him he only paid $25 for it the day before. Wold vowed never to add another string, and that he would tour the world telling his story of how Sherman ripped him off.<ref name=\"Op de Beeck, p.159\"/> All in good fun as Sherman Cooper is a good buddy, who gave him the guitar having had it nailed to the wall as a decoration.<ref name = ObserverSept08/> A lot of the time he also adds (while picking up or putting away the guitar) that it is the \"...biggest piece of shit in the world, I swear.\"{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} On a BBC interview Steve claims that the guitar was found by a friend, just with the three strings on it. So he decided to keep it that way.\n\n====The One-Stringed Diddley Bow====\nThis is a one-stringed instrument played with a [[guitar slide|slide]] (he uses an old screwdriver for this purpose). It consists of a {{convert|2|ft|m|adj=mid|-long}} 2x4, with a semi-loose piece of broom wire nailed to it at both ends. It was made especially for him by [[Super Chikan|James \"Super Chikan\" Johnson]]. An instrument like this is known as a [[diddley bow]].\n\n====The Morris Minor Guitar====\nWhen on the TV show ''[[Top Gear (2002 TV series)|Top Gear]]'', presenter [[Jeremy Clarkson]] commented that Steve's car history of over 100 cars included a [[Morris Minor]]. Steve then presented a four-string guitar that his friend (davey) had made out of two old [[hubcap]]s from a Minor 1000 joined back-to-back and his wife's broomstick. Steve then played it a little in the episode. Clarkson replied that it was the best use of a Morris Minor he had ever seen.\n\nA similar guitar was made out of Hudson [[Terraplane]] hubcaps, one of them given to him by [[Jack White]],<ref>[http://www.sunshinecoastdaily.com.au/news/seasick-steve-performs-bluesfest/1310360/ Cassandra Tobi, \"Seasick Steve performs at Bluesfest\"], ''Sunshine Coast Daily'', March 19, 2012.</ref><ref>[http://www.gigwise.com/photos/68422/2/seasick-steve-interview Seasick Steve: Interview.]</ref> referring to \"[[Terraplane Blues]]\" by [[Robert Johnson]].\n\n====56 Dano====\nHe can be seen playing a '56 [[Danelectro]]/[[Silvertone (instruments)|Silvertone]] single cutaway (modified) on various gigs.\n\n====National Triolian====\nHe used a [[National String Instrument Corporation|National Triolian]] on some gigs and studio recordings. It has ''SEASICK'' etched on the body.\n\n====Four-String Cigar-Box Guitar====\nOften seen using this on gigs.\n\n====Acoustic Parlour Guitar====\nUnknown make.
