They are influenced by bands such as: [[The Brian Jonestown Massacre]], [[The Verve]], [[The Rolling Stones]], [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]], [[T. Rex (band)|T. Rex]], [[The Velvet Underground]], [[Love and Rockets]], [[Daniel Ash]], and [[The Jesus and Mary Chain]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/blackrebelmotorcycleclub |title= Black Rebel Motorcycle Club |accessdate=October 27, 2007 |work= Rolling Stone Artist Section}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n\n===Formation and early years (1998\u20132003)===\nThe band was formed in 1998, originally called The Elements. After discovering that another band had the same name, the members changed the name to Black Rebel Motorcycle Club, after [[Marlon Brando]]'s [[Outlaw motorcycle club|motorcycle gang]] in the 1953 film ''[[The Wild One]]''.\n\nBassist [[Robert Levon Been]] and guitarist [[Peter Hayes (musician)|Peter Hayes]] met at high school in the San Francisco Bay Area city of [[Lafayette, California|Lafayette]] and quickly formed a band; Hayes having recently left [[The Brian Jonestown Massacre]]. Robert has said in interviews that Peter had a turbulent home life and would park and sleep in his car outside the Been household. After about a year of doing this, Robert and his father Michael finally persuaded Peter to live with them. Later, the pair started looking for a drummer. They met Nick Jago, from [[Devon]], England, who had moved to California to be with his parents after spending some time at Winchester School of Art, where he was studying fine art. The vocals are shared between Been and Peter Hayes.\n\nThe band's first two records were indebted to classic [[hard rock]] influenced by [[Led Zeppelin]] and also encompassed slower paced [[psychedelic rock]], [[space rock]], and [[noise pop]] influences from bands such as [[The Verve]], [[Loop (band)|Loop]], [[Sonic Youth]], [[Dinosaur Jr]] and [[The Jesus and Mary Chain]]. Their second album ''[[Take Them On, On Your Own]]'' (recorded with Coldplay/Kasabian producer [[Rik Simpson]]) has several songs such as \"Generation\" and \"US Government\" that are critical of the United States government.\n\nBeen used the pseudonym 'Robert Turner' on the first two records, in an attempt not to be linked to his father ([[Michael Been]] of [[The Call (band)|The Call]]). He later dropped this identity when promoting ''Howl''. The senior Been later toured with Black Rebel Motorcycle Club as part of their sound crew.\n[[File:Leeds Rathaus.jpg|thumb|right|[[Leeds Town Hall]], the venue where Black Rebel Motorcycle Club 'broke the floor']]\nIn 2003, a concert in [[Leeds]], [[West Yorkshire]], England had to be cancelled half way through the set, after [[Leeds City Council]] officials suspected the 150-year old floor of [[Leeds Town Hall]] might collapse.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.leedsmusicscene.net/article/1583/ |title=B.R.M.C. gig stopped due to safety concerns at Leeds Town Hall |publisher=Leedsmusicscene.net |date=November 6, 2003 |accessdate=July 1, 2011}}</ref> This led to the band sometimes being referred to as 'the band who broke the floor'.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blackrebelmotorcycleclub.com/tourarchive/2004/02/14/?s=402 |title=Black Rebel Motorcycle Club |publisher=Black Rebel Motorcycle Club |date= |accessdate=July 1, 2011}}</ref> Problems with drummer [[Nick Jago]] began surfacing publicly at the 2003 [[NME Awards]], when Jago remained on stage for nine minutes, completely silent, while accepting an award.\n\n===''Howl'' era (2004\u20132006)===\nAt the 2004 [[V Festival]], Hayes walked out when asked to sign an inflatable penis. After conflict with their record label, the band was dropped by [[Virgin Records]] in 2004. Jago's conflicts came to a head in Scotland, when Jago and Hayes came to blows after a tense gig. Before long, Jago quit. As such, Jago did not take part in the sessions for the band's third album, ''[[Howl (album)|Howl]]''.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} Instead, he went through various rehab attempts, eventually rejoining the band in time to record one track, the ballad \"Promise\".\n\nIn 2005 the band signed to Echo in the UK, and RCA in the U.S. ''Howl'' was released to mostly favorable reviews. ''Howl'' had a stripped-down folk style, a departure from the earlier B.R.M.C. sound. Several of the songs on ''Howl'' are said to have been written long before the idea of B.R.M.C. was conceived.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} On tour for this album the band also employed a temporary fourth member, guitarist [[Spike Keating]].\n\n===''Baby 81'' and ''The Effects of 333'' (2007\u20132009)===\nBy 2007, Nick Jago had rejoined B.R.M.C. The band's fourth album, ''[[Baby 81 (album)|Baby 81]]'', was released on April 30, 2007 in the UK and Europe and May 1, 2007 in the U.S. The band posted several songs from ''Baby 81'' on their [[MySpace]] page. With ''Baby 81'', they developed a more concrete sound and style: encompassing [[blues]], [[Folk music|folk]], and rock, while remaining angst-ridden in theme.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}\n\nOn June 6, 2007, BRMC performed in a concert that was streamed live on the internet via [[MSN Music]].\n\nIn June 2008, Jago once again left BRMC's touring line-up, being replaced by [[The Raveonettes]]' touring drummer [[Leah Shapiro]].<ref name=\"nmejago2ndleave\">{{cite web |url= http://www.nme.com/news/black-rebel-motorcycle-club/37235 |title= Black Rebel Motorcycle Club's drummer leaves band |accessdate=June 10, 2008 |date=June 10, 2008 |publisher=[[NME]].com}}</ref> Jago stated he \"took it as I am fired again and to be honest with you I respect their decision\".<ref name=\"nmejago2ndleave\" /> However, Hayes and Been issued a statement reading: \"Nick won't be joining us for the upcoming European tour, but it's not true that he is fired. We just feel Nick needs time to sort out exactly what he wants right now. His heart and all his energy and attention is on his own solo project and he needs to see that through.\"<ref name=\"nmejago2ndleave\" />\n\nOn October 27, 2008, the band announced via a [[MySpace]] bulletin that they would release their newest album independently. The album would be their first release through their own \"Abstract Dragon\" label. The album, titled, ''[[The Effects of 333]]'' is completely instrumental and was made available as a digital download through their official music store on 3:33 A.M Pacific Time on November 1, 2008.\n\nOn November 10, 2009 BRMC released a live DVD through [[Vagrant Records]]. It was recorded in [[Glasgow]], Berlin, and [[Dublin]] during the Baby 81 world tour.\n\n===''Beat the Devil's Tattoo'' (2010\u20132011)===\nA song by B.R.M.C., \"Done All Wrong\", appeared on [[The Twilight Saga: New Moon (soundtrack)|the soundtrack]] to the 2009 film ''[[The Twilight Saga: New Moon|New Moon]]''.\n\nBRMC's sixth studio album, ''[[Beat the Devil's Tattoo]]'' was released March 8, 2010 in the UK & Europe and March 9, 2010 in North America. The band went on a world tour that lasted from February to December.\n\nOn August 19, 2010, after the band's performance at the Pukkelpop Festival in Belgium, Robert's father [[Michael Been]] died backstage of a heart attack.\n\nOn November 1, 2010, the band has released their second live DVD, called ''Live in London'', on their own website and at HMV stores in the UK. The DVD would also be for sale at the band's headlining shows throughout the tour. It was filmed in front of a sold-out London Forum on April 23, the same year. This is the last project Michael Been has worked on with the band, mixing it.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blackrebelmotorcycleclub.com/press/new-brmc-live-from-london-dvd-coming-soon.html |title=\u2018Live From London\u2019 DVD |publisher=Black Rebel Motorcycle Club |date=April 23, 2010 |accessdate=April 2, 2012}}</ref>\n\nAs of 2011, the band has started working on their 7th album, which was released in 2013. In between the recording sessions the band performed a South American tour and played their first shows in South Africa, as part of the Synergy Festival in Cape Town and China, in Beijing and Shanghai.\n\nThe band went on a brief, yet successful three-show tour of small clubs in California to promote the album. These shows were at Slim's in [[San Francisco]], The Catalyst in [[Santa Cruz, California|Santa Cruz]], and [[The Troubadour (Los Angeles)|The Troubador]] of [[Los Angeles]] on the December 19, 20 and 21, respectively. All three shows sold out and B.R.M.C. played to packed houses each night where the setlist ranged from classics to quite a bit of new material. Fans came from as far as China to see the band perform live after such a long period of seeming inactivity.\n\nAfter the success of these first shows, the band announced several more shows across Europe with stops in the United Kingdom, Germany, and Italy among other countries. The last announced show will  be at the Austin Psych Fest on April 26, 2013.\n\n===''Specter at the Feast'' (2013)===\nOn January 9, 2013, the band announced via Facebook the name of their seventh album called ''[[Specter at the Feast]]'' which was released on March 18 in the UK and Europe and on March 19 in USA, Canada and worldwide.\n\nIt received mostly positive reviews; many critics noting that despite the band having been together for some time the album showed a mellower and moodier side with songs such as opener `Firewalker'.\n\nThe band made the first single from the record available, a cover of [[The Call (band)|The Call]]'s 1989 hit \"Let the Day Begin\", for free download on their official website. The decision to record the song was a tribute to Robert's father Michael, who used his experience from The Call to help BRMC before his death in the last couple of years. The single became ''Q'' Magazine's track of the day.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blackrebelmotorcycleclub.com/ |title=Let the Day Begin |publisher=Black Rebel Motorcycle Club |date= |accessdate=February 18, 2013}}</ref> The band have also released the ''Let the Day Begin'' EP for free, consisting of the single and the album track \"Returning\", made available for streaming on the official website.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blackrebelmotorcycleclub.com/letthedaybegin/ |title=Black Rebel Motorcycle Club Let the Day Begin |publisher=Blackrebelmotorcycleclub.com |date= |accessdate=March 23, 2013}}</ref>\n\nOn April 8, 2013 it was announced that the band would play at [[Rock Werchter]], the largest rock festival in Belgium.\n\nThe band continues to show a willingness to tour despite the obstacles. During the 2013 tour, the organisers of the Harvest festival in Australia decided to abandon the multi-city event, of which BRMC were one of the lead acts, only a few months ahead of the performances. BRMC was the first band to announce it would still visit the country and play its own shows. Several sold out.\n\n==In popular culture==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2013}}\nThe songs of Black Rebel Motorcycle Club have been featured in several movies, TV series, TV commercials, and video games.
