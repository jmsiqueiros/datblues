''Jazz''. New York: W.W. Norton & Co, ISBN 978-0-393-06861-0</ref> His composition \"[[Jelly Roll Blues]]\" was the first published jazz composition, in 1915. Morton is also notable for naming and popularizing the \"[[Spanish Tinge]]\" ([[habanera (music)|habanera rhythm]] and [[tresillo (rhythm)|tresillo]]), and for writing such [[jazz standard|standards]] as \"[[King Porter Stomp]]\", \"[[Wolverine Blues (Jelly Roll Morton)|Wolverine Blues]]\", \"[[Black Bottom Stomp]]\", and \"I Thought I Heard [[Buddy Bolden]] Say\", the latter a tribute to New Orleans personalities from the turn of the 19th century to 20th century.\n\nReputed for his arrogance and self-promotion as often as recognized in his day for his musical talents, Morton claimed to have invented jazz outright in 1902\u2014much to the derision of later musicians and critics.<ref>Critic [{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p7181/biography|pure_url=yes}} Scott Yanow] writes, \"Jelly Roll Morton did himself a lot of harm posthumously by exaggerating his worth, claiming to have invented jazz in 1902.

Taylor and Francis, February 2013. {{doi|10.1080/03007766.2011.613225}}.</ref>\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early life and education===\nMorton was born into a [[Creole of Color]] family in the [[Faubourg Marigny]] neighborhood of [[Downtown New Orleans|downtown]] [[New Orleans]], [[Louisiana]]. Sources differ as to his birth date: a baptismal certificate issued in 1894 lists his date of birth as October 20, 1890; Morton and his half-sisters claimed he was born on September 20, 1885.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} His [[World War I]] draft registration card showed September 13, 1884, but his California death certificate listed his birth as September 20, 1889. He was born to F. P. Lamothe and Louise Monette (written as Lemott and Monett on his baptismal certificate). Eulaley Haco (Eulalie H\u00e9caud) was the godparent. H\u00e9caud helped choose his christening name of Ferdinand. His parents lived in a [[common-law marriage]] and were not legally married. No birth certificate has been found to date.\n\nFerdinand started playing music as a child, showing early talent. After his parents separated, his mother married a man named Mouton. Ferdinand took his stepfather's name and anglicized it as \"Morton\".\n\n===Musical career===\n[[Image:Jelly Roll Blues 1915.jpg|upright|thumb|Morton claimed to have written \"Jelly Roll Blues\" in 1905.]]\n\nAt the age of fourteen, Morton began working as a piano player in a [[wikt:brothel|brothel]] (or as it was referred to then, a sporting house). While working there, he was living with his religious, church-going great-grandmother; he had her convinced that he worked as a night watchman in a barrel factory.\n\nIn that atmosphere, he often sang smutty lyrics; he took the nickname \"Jelly Roll\",<ref>[http://tafkac.org/songs/what_is_a_jellyroll_more.html Eventually, he became \"Jelly Roll\" Morton, taking on the name of the female pudenda]</ref> which was black slang for female genitalia.<ref>[http://nfo.net/usa/etymol.html jelly roll\u2014Black slang from the 19th century for the vulva, with various related meanings, i.e. sexual intercourse, a loving woman, a man obsessed with finding same.]</ref>\n\nAfter Morton's grandmother found out that he was playing jazz in a local brothel, she kicked him out of her house. He said:\n\n<blockquote>When my grandmother found out that I was playing jazz in one of the sporting houses in the District, she told me that I had disgraced the family and forbade me to live at the house... She told me that devil music would surely bring about my downfall, but I just couldn't put it behind me.<ref>[http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/cultureshock/beyond/jazz.html Culture Shock: The TV Series and Beyond: \"The Devil's Music: 1920's Jazz\"], PBS</ref></blockquote>\n\n[[Tony Jackson (jazz musician)|Tony Jackson]], also a pianist at brothels and an accomplished guitar player, was a major influence on Morton's music. Jelly Roll said that Jackson was the only pianist better than he was.\n\n===Touring===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Morton-Jelly 01.gif|upright|thumb|right|Morton (2nd from right) with [[Bricktop]] (right) in Los Angeles in 1918]] -->\nAround 1904, Morton also started touring in the American South, working with [[minstrel shows]], gambling and composing. His works \"[[Jelly Roll Blues]]\", \"New Orleans Blues\", \"Frog-I-More Rag\", \"Animule Dance\", and \"[[King Porter Stomp]]\" were composed during this period. He got to [[Chicago]] in 1910 and New York City in 1911, where future [[stride (music)|stride]] greats [[James P. Johnson]] and [[Willie \"The Lion\" Smith]] caught his act, years before the blues were widely played in the North. {{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}\n\nIn 1912\u20131914, Morton toured with his girlfriend Rosa Brown as a [[vaudeville]] act before settling in Chicago for three years. By 1914, he had started writing down his compositions. In 1915 his \"Jelly Roll Blues\" was arguably the first jazz composition ever published, recording as sheet music the New Orleans traditions that had been jealously guarded by the musicians. In 1917, he followed bandleader [[William Manuel Johnson]] and Johnson's sister Anita Gonzalez to California, where Morton's [[tango music|tango]] \"The Crave\" made a sensation in Hollywood. {{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}\n\n===Vancouver===\nMorton was invited to play a new [[Vancouver]] [[nightclub]] called [[The Patricia]], on [[Hastings Street (Vancouver)|East Hastings Street]]. The jazz historian [[Mark Miller (author)|Mark Miller]] described his arrival as \"an extended period of itinerancy as a pianist, vaudeville performer, gambler, hustler, and, as legend would have it, pimp\".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/radio2/programs/2010/03/jelly-rolled-into-vancouver.html|title=Jelly Rolled into Vancouver|publisher=[[CBC Radio 2]]|accessdate=2010-09-09|date=2010-03-31}}</ref>\n\n===Chicago===\nMorton returned to Chicago in 1923 to claim authorship of his recently published rag, \"The Wolverines\", which had become a hit as \"Wolverine Blues\" in the Windy City. He released the first of his commercial recordings, first as piano rolls, then on record, both as a piano soloist and with various jazz bands.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}\n\nIn 1926, Morton succeeded in getting a contract to record for the largest and most prestigious company in the United States, [[Victor Talking Machine Company|Victor]]. This gave him a chance to bring a well-rehearsed band to play his arrangements in Victor's Chicago recording studios. These recordings by ''Jelly Roll Morton & His Red Hot Peppers'' are regarded as classics of 1920s jazz. The Red Hot Peppers featured such other New Orleans jazz luminaries as [[Kid Ory]], [[Omer Simeon]], [[George Mitchell (jazz musician)|George Mitchell]], [[Johnny St. Cyr]], [[Barney Bigard]], [[Johnny Dodds]], [[Baby Dodds]], and [[Andrew Hilaire]]. Jelly Roll Morton & His Red Hot Peppers were one of the first acts booked on tours by [[Music Corporation of America|MCA]]. {{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}\n\n==Marriage and family==\nIn November 1928, Morton at the age of 38 married the showgirl Mabel Bertrand in [[Gary, Indiana]].\n\n===New York City===\nThey moved that year to [[New York City]], where Morton continued to record for Victor. His piano solos and trio recordings are well regarded, but his band recordings suffer in comparison with the Chicago sides, where Morton could draw on many great New Orleans musicians for sidemen. {{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} Although he recorded with the noted musicians clarinetists [[Omer Simeon]], [[George Baquet]], [[Albert Nicholas]], [[Wilton Crawley]], [[Barney Bigard]], [[Lorenzo Tio]] and [[Artie Shaw]], trumpeters [[Bubber Miley]], [[Johnny Dunn]] and [[Henry \"Red\" Allen]], saxophonists [[Sidney Bechet]], [[Paul Barnes (musician)|Paul Barnes]] and [[Bud Freeman]], bassist [[Pops Foster]], and drummers [[Paul Barbarin]], [[Cozy Cole]] and [[Zutty Singleton]], Morton generally had trouble finding musicians who wanted to play his style of jazz. His New York sessions failed to produce a hit. {{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}\n\nWith the [[Great Depression]] and the near collapse of the record industry, Victor did not renew Morton's recording contract for 1931. Morton continued playing in New York, but struggled financially. He briefly had a radio show in 1934, then took on touring in the band of a traveling burlesque act for some steady income. His compositions were recorded by the  musicians [[Fletcher Henderson]], [[Benny Goodman]] and others, but he received no royalties from these recordings. {{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}\n\n===Washington, D.C.===\nIn 1935, Morton moved to [[Washington, D.C.]], to become the manager/piano player of a [[dive bar|bar]] called, at various times, the \"Music Box\", \"Blue Moon Inn\", and \"Jungle Inn\" in the [[African-American]] neighborhood of [[Shaw, Washington, D.C.|Shaw]]. (The building that hosted the nightclub stands at 1211 [[U Street]] NW.) Morton was also the master of ceremonies, bouncer, and bartender of the club. He lived in Washington for a few years; the club owner allowed all her friends free admission and drinks, which prevented Morton from making the business a success.<ref name=\"Jazz\"/>\n\nIn 1938 Morton was stabbed by a friend of the owner and suffered wounds to the head and chest. After this incident his wife Mabel demanded that they leave Washington.<ref name=\"Jazz\">[http://www.gwu.edu/~jazz/performersp.html \"Prominent Jazz Musicians: Their Histories in Washington, D.C.\"], George Washington University</ref>\n{{Listen\n|filename=Morton-Tiger Rag.ogg|title=\"Tiger Rag\"| description=Sample of Morton's introduction and performance of the piece, with its innovative moving [[tone cluster]] evoking a tiger's growl}}\n\nDuring Morton's brief residency at the Music Box, the folklorist [[Alan Lomax]] heard the pianist playing in the bar. In May 1938, Lomax invited Morton to record music and interviews for the [[Library of Congress]]. The sessions, originally intended as a short interview with musical examples for use by music researchers in the Library of Congress, soon expanded to record more than eight hours of Morton talking and playing piano. Lomax also conducted longer interviews during which he took notes but did not record. Despite the low fidelity of these non-commercial recordings, their musical and historical importance have attracted numerous jazz fans, and they have helped to ensure Morton's place in jazz history.<ref name = \"Congress\">{{cite web| url = http://www.loc.gov/today/pr/2006/06-040.html| title = Library of Congress Recordings of Jelly Roll Morton Win at Grammys| date = 2006-01-14| accessdate = 2009-12-27| publisher = Library of Congress}}</ref>\n\nLomax was very interested in Morton's Storyville days and the ribald songs of the time. Although reluctant to recount and record these, Morton eventually obliged Lomax. Because of the suggestive nature of the songs, some of the Library of Congress recordings were not released until 2005.<ref name = \"Congress\"/>\n\nIn his interviews, Morton claimed to have been born in 1885. He was aware that if he had been born in 1890, he would have been slightly too young to make a good case as the inventor of jazz. He said in the interview that [[Buddy Bolden]] played [[ragtime]] but not jazz; this is not accepted by the consensus of Bolden's other New Orleans contemporaries. The contradictions may stem from different definitions for the terms ''ragtime'' and ''jazz''. These interviews, released in different forms over the years, were released on an eight-CD [[boxed set]] in 2005, ''[[The Complete Library of Congress Recordings]]''. This collection won two [[Grammy Award]]s.<ref name = \"Congress\"/> The same year, Morton was honored with the [[Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award]].\n\n===Later years===\nWhen Morton was stabbed and wounded, a nearby [[racial segregation|whites-only]] hospital refused to treat him, as the city had racially segregated facilities. He was transported to a black hospital further away. {{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} When he was in the hospital, the doctors left ice on his wounds for several hours before attending to his eventually fatal injury. His recovery from his wounds was incomplete, and thereafter he was often ill and easily became short of breath. Morton made a new series of commercial recordings in New York, several recounting tunes from his early years that he discussed in his Library of Congress interviews. {{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}\n\nWorsening [[asthma]] sent him to a New York hospital for three months at one point. He continued to suffer from respiratory problems when visiting [[Los Angeles]] with a series of manuscripts of new tunes and arrangements, planning to form a new band and restart his career. Morton died on July 10, 1941 after an eleven-day stay in [[Los Angeles County-USC Medical Center|Los Angeles County General Hospital]].\n\nAccording to the jazz historian David Gelly in 2000, Morton's arrogance and \"bumptious\" persona alienated so many musicians over the years that no colleagues or admirers attended his funeral.<ref>Gelly, David, ''Icons of Jazz: A History In Photographs, 1900-2000'', San Diego, Ca: Thunder Bay Books, 2000, ISBN 1-57145-268-0</ref>  But, a contemporary news account of the funeral in the August 1, 1941 issue of ''Downbeat'' says that fellow musicians Kid Ory, Mutt Carey, Fred Washington and Ed Garland were among his pall bearers. The story notes the absence of Duke Ellington and Jimmie Lunceford, both of whom were appearing in Los Angeles at the time.  (The article is reproduced in Alan Lomax's biography of Morton, ''Mister Jelly Roll'', University of California Press, 1950.)\n\n==Piano style==\nMorton's piano style was formed from early secondary ragtime and \"shout\",{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} which also evolved separately into the New York school of [[Stride (music)|stride piano]]. Morton's playing was also close to [[barrelhouse]], which produced [[boogie woogie]]. {{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}\n\nMorton often played the melody of a tune with his right thumb, while sounding a harmony above these notes with other fingers of the right hand. This added a rustic or \"out-of-tune\" sound (due to the playing of a [[Diminished fifth|diminished 5th]] above the melody). This may still be recognized as belonging to New Orleans. Morton also [[Bassline#Walking bass|walk]]ed in [[major sixth|major]] and [[minor sixth]]s in the bass, instead of tenths or octaves. He played basic swing rhythms in both the left and right hand.\n\n==Compositions==\nSome of Morton's songs (listed alphabetically):\n{{multicol}}\n*\"Big Foot Ham\" (a.k.a. \"Ham & Eggs\")\n*\"[[Black Bottom Stomp]]\"\n*\"[[Boogaboo]]\"\n*\"Burnin' the Iceberg\"\n*\"The Crave\"\n*\"Creepy Feelin\"\n*\"Doctor Jazz Stomp\"\n*\"The Dirty Dozen\"\n*\"Fickle Fay Creep\"\n*\"Finger Buster\"\n*\"Freakish\"\n*\"Frog-I-More Rag\"\n*\"Ganjam\"\n*\"Good Old New York\"\n{{multicol-break}}\n*\"Grandpa's Spells\"\n*\"Jungle Blues\"\n*\"Kansas City Stomp\"\n*\"[[King Porter Stomp]]\"\n*\"London Blues\"\n*\"Mama Nita\"\n*\"Milenberg Joys\"\n*\"Mint Julep\"\n*\"Murder Ballad\"\n*\"My Home Is in a Southern Town\"\n*\"New Orleans Bump\"\n*\"Pacific Rag\"\n*\"The Pearls\"\n*\"Pep\"\n{{multicol-break}}\n*\"Pontchartrain\"\n*\"Red Hot Pepper\"\n*\"Shreveport Stomp\"\n*\"Sidewalk Blues\"\n*\"Stratford Hunch\"\n*\"Sweet Substitute\"\n*\"Tank Town Bump\"\n*\"Turtle Twist\"\n*\"Why?\"\n*\"[[Wolverine Blues (Jelly Roll Morton)|Wolverine Blues]]\"\n{{multicol-end}}\n\nSeveral of Morton's compositions were musical tributes to himself, including \"Winin' Boy\", \"The Jelly Roll Blues\", subtitled \"The Original Jelly-Roll\"; and \"Mr. Jelly Lord\". In the [[Big Band]] era, his \"King Porter Stomp\", which Morton had written decades earlier, was a big hit for [[Fletcher Henderson]] and [[Benny Goodman]]; it became a standard covered by most other swing bands of that time. Morton claimed to have written some tunes that were copyrighted by others, including \"[[I'm Alabama Bound|Alabama Bound]]\" and \"[[Tiger Rag]]\".  \"Sweet Peter,\" which Morton recorded in 1926, appears to be the source for the melody of the hit song \"All Of Me,\" ostensibly written by Gerald Marks and Seymour Simons in 1931.\n\nHis musical influence continues in the work of [[Dick Hyman]] and [[Reginald Robinson]]. {{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}\n\n===Albums===\n* ''The Piano Rolls'' (Nonesuch, 1997)\n* ''Giants of Jazz'' (Collectables, 1998)\n* ''Mr. Jelly Roll'' (Tomato Music, 2003)\n\n==Legacy and fictional portrayals==\n*Two [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] shows have featured his music, ''Jelly Roll'' and ''[[Jelly's Last Jam]]''. The first draws heavily on Morton's own words and stories from the Library of Congress interviews.\n\n*Jelly Roll Morton appears as the piano \"professor\" in Louis Malle's ''[[Pretty Baby (1978 film)|Pretty Baby]]'', where he is portrayed by actor [[Antonio Fargas]], with piano and vocals played by [[James Booker]].\n\n*''Jelly Roll Morton's Last Night at the Jungle Inn: An Imaginary Memoir'' (1984) was written by the ethnomusicologist and folklorist [[Samuel Charters]], embellishing Morton's early stories about his life.<ref>{{cite book |title=Jelly Roll Morton's Last Night at the Jungle Inn: An Imaginary Memoir |last= Charters |first=Samuel Barclay |authorlink=Samuel Charters |publisher=Marion Boyars |year=1984 |isbn=0-7145-2805-6}}</ref>\n*Morton and his godmother, Eulalie, appear as characters in [[David Fulmer]]'s mystery novel, ''Chasing the Devil's Tail''.\n*Jelly Roll Morton is featured in [[Alessandro Baricco]]'s book, ''Novecento''. He is the \"inventor of jazz\" and the protagonist's rival throughout the book. This book was adapted as  a movie: ''[[The Legend of 1900]]'', directed by [[Giuseppe Tornatore]]. His character is played by the actor [[Clarence Williams III]].\n\n*Jelly Roll Morton was inducted in the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] and was elected as a charter member of the [[Gennett Records]] Walk of Fame.\n*In 2008, Jelly Roll Morton was inducted into The [[Louisiana Music Hall of Fame]].<ref>[http://www.louisianamusichalloffame.org Louisiana Music Hall of Fame]</ref>\n\n*The play, ''Don't You Leave Me Here'', by Clare Brown, which premiered at [[West Yorkshire Playhouse]] on 27 September 2008, deals with Morton's relationship with [[Tony Jackson (jazz musician)|Tony Jackson]].\n\n==Selected discography==\n*''1923/24'' 1923-1924 ([[Milestone Records]])\n*''Red Hot Peppers Session: Birth of the Hot, The Classic Red Hot Peppers Sessions'' ( RCA Bluebird) 1926-1927 \n*''The Pearls'' 1926-1939 (RCA Bluebird Records)\n*''Jazz King of New Orleans'' 1926-1930 (RCA Bluebird Records)\n*''(1938) The Complete Library of Congress Recordings, Vol. 1-8 (8CD)''  ([[Rounder Records]])\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Music}}\n*[[List of ragtime composers]]\n*[[Chord names and symbols (popular music)]] - Jerry Gates, a professor of [[Berklee College of Music]], tells that he has heard chord symbols came from [[Ferde Grof\u00e9]] and Jelly Roll Morton.<ref name=\"chord symbols origin\">{{Cite web |url = http://jerrygates.berkleemusicblogs.com/2011/02/16/chord-symbols-as-we-know-them-today-where-did-they-come-from/ |title = Chord Symbols As We Know Them Today \u2013 Where Did They Come From? |accessdate = 2013-10-13 |last = Gates |first = Jerry |author = |authorlink = |coauthors = |date = 2011-02-16 |year = |month = |format = |work = |publisher = [[Berklee College of Music]] |page = |pages = |quote = |language = |archiveurl = |archivedate = |deadlinkdate = |doi = |ref =}}</ref>\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n*[[James Dapogny|Dapogny, James]].
