After serving sixteen years at Microsoft, Allchin retired in early 2007 when Microsoft officially released the [[Windows Vista]] [[operating system]] to consumers.<ref name=\"jimretire\">{{cite web | url=http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/exec/jim/default.mspx | title=Jim Allchin  (Former) Co-President, Platforms & Services Division | author=Microsoft | date=January 30, 2007 | work=Microsoft PressPass | accessdate=2007-02-02}}</ref> He is now a professional [[musician]].<ref>http://www.jimallchin.com</ref>\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early years===\nAllchin was born in [[Grand Rapids, Michigan]], in 1951. While he was still an infant, the Allchin family moved to [[Keysville, Florida]], where his parents worked on a farm.  Allchin grew up in a tin-roof house built by his father.<ref name=\"breakingwindows\">{{cite book | title=Breaking Windows | last=Bank | first=David | year=2001 | publisher=Free Press | isbn=0-7432-0315-1}}</ref>  Later, Allchin and his older brother Keith also worked on the farm to support the family's financially.<ref name=\"breakingwindows\" />\n\nWhile fixing equipment on the farm, Allchin developed an interest in engineering. He briefly studied [[Electrical engineering]] at the [[University of Florida]], but dropped out to play in a number of bands. He later returned to the university and graduated with [[Bachelor of Science|B.S.]] in [[Computer Science]] in 1973.\n\nAfter receiving his degree, Allchin joined [[Texas Instruments]], where he helped to build a new [[operating system]]. Afterwards, he followed a former lecturer, [[Dick Kiger]], to [[Wyoming]], where he helped him to start a new company offering computer services nationwide, before moving on to another company in [[Dallas, Texas]].\n\nAfter his stint of employment, Allchin returned to his studies, earning the degree of [[Master's degree|M.S.]] in Computer Science from [[Stanford University]] in 1980. While pursuing his [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in Computer Science at [[Georgia Institute of Technology]] in the early eighties, he was the primary architect of the Clouds distributed [[object-oriented operating system]];<ref name=\"wiredinterview\">{{cite web | url=http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/7.12/allchin.html | title=Code Warrior | first=Chip | last=Bayers |date=December 1999 | publisher=Wired | accessdate=2006-10-28}}</ref> his thesis was entitled \"An Architecture for Reliable Decentralized Systems\".<ref>{{cite web | url=http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=911173 | title=An architecture for reliable decentralized systems | year=1983| publisher=Georgia Institute of Technology| accessdate=2008-05-14}}</ref>\n\nIn 1983, Allchin was recruited to [[Banyan (company)|Banyan]] by founder Dave Mahoney, eventually being Senior Vice President and [[Chief Technology Officer]]. During his seven years at Banyan, he created the [[Banyan VINES|VINES]] distributed operating system, including the StreetTalk directory protocol.\n\n[[Bill Gates]] tried to recruit a reluctant Allchin to join Microsoft for a year and successfully convinced him in 1990.  Gates told him that whatever he created would have a wider customer base through Microsoft than anyone else.<ref name=\"breakingwindows\" />\n\nAllchin is known as a prolific computer programmer/engineer.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CE1D91731F935A35755C0A965958260 | title=Profile/James Allchin; Bill Gates Has a Vision; Can This Man Deliver?| first=John | last=Markoff |date=June 1993 | publisher=New York Times| accessdate=2008-05-15}}</ref> Allchin is also known for [[debugging]] systems remotely by having the person on the phone toggle in hexadecimal via front panel switches of early computers to correct problems.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://homes.cerias.purdue.edu/~spaf/Yucks/V0/msg00118.html | title=Real Programmers Don't Write Specs | first=Gene | last=Spafford | authorlink=Gene Spafford |date=November 1990 | publisher=Ed Post | accessdate=2008-05-15}}</ref>\n\n===Microsoft===\nInitially, Gates put Allchin in charge of revamping the Local Area Network Manager, using his networking expertise. However, Allchin scrapped the project, citing the need to start fresh.\n\nAllchin's first high-profile project at Microsoft was the [[Cairo (operating system)|Cairo]] technology, which was intended to add on to [[Windows NT]] to create the next version of the operating system.<ref>{{cite book | title=Showstopper! The Breakneck Race to Create Windows NT and the Next Generation at Microsoft | first=G. Pascal | last=Zachary | year=1994 | publisher=Warner Books | isbn=0-02-935671-7}}</ref> At the NT Developer Conference in July 1992, Allchin gave a presentation about the future Microsoft operating system. One of the main goals for Cairo was the ability for users to locate files based on their content as opposed to their name. Users would also have access to files stored on other machines on a network as easily as they had access to files on their own hard drives.  Cairo was scheduled to ship as a single package in 1994. After several delays, it was finally released in pieces; the technology was shipped in successive operating system releases.<ref name=\"wiredinterview\" /> The Cairo and Windows NT groups were combined, and Allchin created a new client and server organization focused on business and IT users.  Allchin replaced [[Dave Cutler]] as the lead developer on Windows NT version 3.5 onwards.<ref name=\"breakingwindows\" /> This led to conflict with Vice President [[Brad Silverberg]], who was in charge of the development of [[Windows 95]], the operating system which was aimed at the personal computer market as opposed to Windows NT's business computer market.\n\nIn 1999, Microsoft re-organized its corporate structure. The Consumer Division, which maintained versions of Windows for home users and the Business & Enterprise Division, which maintained Windows NT, were combined into a single operating system division: the Platform Group. Allchin became the vice president of the new combined group. This promotion put him in charge of the development of both the home and business versions of Windows. With the release of Windows XP in 2001, both business and client versions of the operating system utilized the same code base. The server business grew substantially during this period of time.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/microsoft/2003545685_brier29.html | title=Vista chief proud of accomplishments | date=January 29, 2007 |first=Brier | last=Dudley | publisher=The Seattle Times|accessdate=2008-05-19}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.microsoft.com/msft/earnings/FY08/earn_rel_q3_08.mspx| title=Microsoft Reports Record Third-Quarter Revenue | author=Microsoft | date=April 24, 2008 | work=Microsoft earnings release | accessdate=2008-05-19}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.microsoft.com/msft/reports/ar00/mdna.htm | title=Microsoft Microsoft 2000 Annual Report | author=Microsoft | date=July 18, 2000 | work=Microsoft Annual Report | accessdate=2008-05-19}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.microsoft.com/msft/reports/ar99/mdna.htm | title=Microsoft 1999 Annual Report | author=Microsoft | date=July 19, 1999 | work=Microsoft Annual Report | accessdate=2008-05-19}}</ref>\n\nAllchin was diagnosed with cancer in late 2002 and took a leave of absence for part of 2003.  Gates suggested that Allchin stay for a while.\n\nOn September 20, 2005, Microsoft announced that Allchin would become co-president of a new Platform Products and Services Group, which combined the old Platform Group, Server and Tools Group, and the MSN Group. Microsoft also announced that Allchin would retire after [[Windows Vista]] shipped, leaving Kevin Johnson as the president.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2005/sep05/09-20ExecChangesPR.mspx | title=Microsoft Realigns for Next Wave of Innovation and Growth | author=Microsoft | date=September 20, 2005 | work=Microsoft press release | accessdate=2007-02-02}}</ref>\n\nAllchin was a member of the Senior Leadership Team at Microsoft \u2014 a small group responsible for developing Microsoft's core direction along with [[Steve Ballmer]] and Bill Gates. He was said to be blunt, technical, and straightforward. Bill Gates complimented him: {{cquote|\"He's a brilliant technologist, visionary, and a strong leader.\"<ref name=\"wiredinterview\" />}}\n\n===Controversies===\nRunning the most profitable product areas within Microsoft caused Allchin to be dragged in many controversies and disputes along with his business and technical leadership responsibilities.\n\n[[Brad Silverberg]], the Microsoft executive, who had been responsible for Windows 95, emailed several people in Microsoft 27 September 1991: {{cquote|... after [[IBM]] announces support for [[DR DOS|dr-dos]] at comdex, it's a small step for them to also announce they will be selling [[NetWare Lite|netware lite]], maybe sometime soon thereafter. but count on it.

Microsoft]] antitrust trial, emails sent by Allchin to other Microsoft executives were considered as an evidence by the government lawyers to back up their claim that the integration of [[Internet Explorer]] and Windows had more to do with their competition with [[Netscape Communications Corporation]] than innovation.<ref name=\"breakingwindows\" />\n\nDuring the [[Caldera v. Microsoft]] case, emails from Allchin to Bill Gates were introduced as an evidence. One email, from September 1991, included Allchin telling Gates that \"We need to slaughter [[Novell]] before they get stronger.\"<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.groklaw.net/articlebasic.php?story=2006120516224886 | title=Comes v.

Valloppillil wrote two memos which were intended for Senior Vice-President [[Paul Maritz]] who was the most senior executive at that time after Bill Gates and [[Steve Ballmer]]. Both memos were leaked and popularly known as the [[Halloween documents]].<ref name=\"breakingwindows\" />\n\nOn September 29, 1998, Allchin was deposed to respond to the testimony of Professor [[Edward Felten]]. Later he testified in court from February 1 to February 4, 1999.  Some of his testimony were centered on the possibilities of removing Internet Explorer as stated by Felten. While Allchin proved his written testimony was correct in court,<ref name=\"worldwar3.0\">{{cite book | title=World War 3.0 Microsoft and its Enemies| last=Auletta| first=Ken| authorlink=Ken Auletta | year=2001 | publisher=Random House | isbn=0-375-50366-8}}</ref> a video-taped demonstration created by Microsoft attorneys, which supposedly illustrated Allchin's points, was shown to be misleading.<ref name=\"worldwar3.0\" /> David Boies believed it was an avoidable mistake made by the Microsoft attorneys.<ref name=\"worldwar3.0\"/>\n\nIn May 2002, Allchin testified before Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly during the settlement hearing between Microsoft and the nine states (as well as the District of Columbia) involved in the United States v. Microsoft antitrust trial. Allchin was called to testify on two issues, the first of which gained the most publicity. In relation to the issue of sharing technical [[application programming interface|API]] and [[Protocol (computing)|protocol]] information used throughout Microsoft products, which the states were seeking, Allchin's testimony discussed how releasing certain information could increase the security risk to consumers.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/legal/allchin.mspx | title=Written Direct Testimony of Jim Allchin | first=Jim | last=Allchin| date=May 3, 2002 | publisher=Microsoft | accessdate=2008-05-15}}</ref>\n\n{{cquote|It is no exaggeration to say that the national security is also implicated by the efforts of [[Hacker (computer security)|hackers]] to break into computing networks. Computers, including many running Windows operating systems, are used throughout the United States Department of Defense and by the armed forces of the United States in Afghanistan and elsewhere.}}\n\nAccording to exhibits filed in 2006 by the plaintiff in the case of Comes v. Microsoft, Allchin wrote a memo to Bill Gates and Steve Ballmer in January 2004, one which was critical of Microsoft and Longhorn. The letter said that Gates and Ballmer had lost their way and compared them to [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] whom he believed had not.\n\n{{cquote|I am not sure how the company lost sight of what matters to our customers (both business and home) the most, but in my view we lost our way. I think our teams lost sight of what bug-free means, what resilience means, what full scenarios mean, what security means, what performance means, how important current applications are, and really understanding what the most important problems our customers face are. I see lots of random features and some great vision, but that doesn\u2019t translate into great products.\n\nI would buy a Mac today if I was not working at Microsoft.... Apple did not lose their way....<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.techworld.com/storage/blogs/index.cfm?entryid=393 | title=FW: losing our way... | author=Jim Allchin | date=January 7, 2004 | accessdate=2007-08-28 }}</ref>}}\n\nAllchin was also critical of Microsoft relaxing its requirements for computers to carry the 'Vista Capable' badge. The seal, designed to inform customers of a computers ability to run the Windows Vista operating system, was not initially intended for computers running Intel's 915 chipset. This was overturned, however, after Intel voiced their dissatisfaction with the decision. In an E-mail to Microsoft's Steve Ballmer, Allchin wrote:\n\n{{cquote|I believe we are going to be misleading customers with the Capable program. OEMs will say a machine is Capable and customers will believe that it will run all the core Vista features.\n\n...We must avoid confusion. It is wrong for customers.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://blog.seattlepi.nwsource.com/microsoft/archives/154340.asp | title=Vista specs changed to help Intel | author=Joseph Tartakoff | date=November 16, 2008 | accessdate=2008-11-16 }}</ref>}}\n\n===Post Microsoft - Musician===\nToday, Allchin devotes his time to music and charity work.  Allchin writes and performs music. He released his first album, ''Enigma'', in 2009. He called the album a beta test. In September 2011, Allchin released a second, blues-themed album: ''Overclocked''.   His third album, ''Q.E.D.'', was released in September 2013.
