After running away from home at the age of seven, Gillum spent the next few years in [[Charleston, Mississippi]], working and playing for tips on local street corners.  He moved to [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]] in 1923, meeting up with the [[guitarist]], [[Big Bill Broonzy]].<ref name=\"amg\"/>  The [[duet (music)|duo]] started working [[nightclub|club]] dates around the city and, by 1934, Gillum started [[sound recording and reproduction|recording]] for both [[ARC Records|ARC]] and [[Bluebird Records]]. \n\nHe appeared on many of the highly popular \"Bluebird beat\" recordings produced by [[Lester Melrose]] in the 1930s and 1940s, under his own name and as a [[sideman]].<ref name=\"amg\"/> Gillum was the first to record the blues classic \"[[Key to the Highway]]\" (featuring Broonzy on guitar) utilizing the now-standard melody and 8-bar blues arrangement. (The song had first been recorded a few months earlier by Charlie Segar, with a different melody and a 12-bar blues arrangement.)  Gillum's version of the song was then covered by Broonzy a few months later, and has become the standard arrangement of this now-classic blues song.  Gillum's records also resulted in some of the very earliest recordings of electric guitar in blues, when 16-year-old fledgling jazz guitarist [[George Barnes (musician)|George Barnes]] was featured on several songs on the 1938 Gillum session that produced \"Reefer Headed Woman\" and others.\n\nGillum joined the [[United States Army]] in 1942 and served until 1945.<ref name=\"doc\"/> Gillum recorded an early version of  \"[[Look on Yonder Wall]]\" (1946) with [[Big Maceo Merriweather|Big Maceo]] on [[piano]], which was later popularized by [[Elmore James]].<ref name=\"russell\">{{cite book\n| first= Tony\n| last= Russell\n| year= 1997\n| title= The Blues: From Robert Johnson to Robert Cray\n| edition= \n| publisher= Carlton Books Limited \n| location= Dubai\n| isbn= 1-85868-255-X\n| page= 113}}</ref>\n\nHowever, after the Bluebird [[record label]] folded in the late 1940s he made few further recordings. His last, slightly sad recordings were on a couple of 1961 albums with [[Memphis Slim]] and the [[singer]]-[[guitarist]] [[Arbee Stidham]] on [[Folkways Records]].<ref name=\"russell\"/>\n\nOn 29 March 1966, during a street argument, he was shot in the head and was pronounced [[dead on arrival]] at Garfield Park Hospital in Chicago.<ref name=\"doc\"/> He is buried at [[Burr Oak Cemetery and Restvale Cemetery|Restvale Cemetery]] in [[Alsip, Illinois]]. \n<ref name=\"doc\">[http://www.document-records.com/fulldetails.asp?ProdID=DOCD-5197 Document Records website - biographical notes -  extracted January 2008]</ref>\n\nGillum's daughter, Ardella Williams, is active as a blues singer in Chicago.\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of blues musicians]]\n*[[List of harmonicists]]\n*[[List of Chicago blues musicians]]\n*[[List of Country blues musicians]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p80069|pure_url=yes}} Allmusic]\n*[http://www.folkways.si.edu/searchresults.aspx?sPhrase=Jazz%20Gillum&sType='phrase'/ Gillum Discography on Folkways]\n*[http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&GRid=10656 Findagrave.com details]\n*[http://www.document-records.com/fulldetails.asp?ProdID=DOCD-5197 Document-records.com biography on Gillum]\n\n{{Authority control|VIAF=19865338}}\n{{Persondata <!-- Metadata: see [[Wikipedia:Persondata]]. -->\n| NAME              = Gillum, William McKinley\n| ALTERNATIVE NAMES = Gillum, Jazz\n| SHORT DESCRIPTION = [[United States|American]] [[blues]] [[harmonica]] player\n| DATE OF BIRTH     = September 11, 1904\n| PLACE OF BIRTH    = [[Indianola, Mississippi]] [[United States]]\n| DATE OF DEATH     = March 29, 1966\n| PLACE OF DEATH    = [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]], United States\n}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Gillum, Jazz}}\n[[Category:1904 births]]\n[[Category:1966 deaths]]\n[[Category:African-American musicians]]\n[[Category:American blues harmonica players]]\n[[Category:American blues musicians]]\n[[Category:People from Sunflower County, Mississippi]]\n[[Category:Deaths by firearm in Illinois]]"}]}}}}
