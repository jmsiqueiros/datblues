His initial inspiration came from hearing [[Little Walter]] on a [[Nashville, Tennessee]], based [[radio station]], and by his teenage years Dyer was playing acoustic harmonica and had formed his own band. He started playing amplified harmonica in the early 1950s, when he first performed alongside [[Smokey Wilson]].<ref name=\"Blind Pig\"/><ref name=\"Oldies\"/> \n\nDyer relocated to Los Angeles, [[California]] in January 1958,<ref name=\"Oldies\">{{cite web |url=http://www.oldies.com/artist-biography/Johnny-Dyer.html |title=Johnny Dyer|author=Larkin, Colin; ''[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music]]''|publisher=Oldies.com |accessdate=October 17, 2010}}</ref> where he met [[George \"Harmonica\" Smith]]. Together they played concerts with a \"father and son\" billing. Dyer commented on that time stating, \"Smith was the hottest thing around and the blues was really swinging! He taught me a lot. Everybody loved George.\" Following this Dyer set up his own combo, Johnny Dyer and the Blue Notes, and played with [[Jimmy Reed]], [[J.B. Hutto]], and [[Jimmy Rogers]].<ref name=\"Blind Pig\"/> \n\nTimes took a downturn for Dyer in the 1960s, and he stepped away from the music industry for some time. Finally appearing again in the 1980s, Dyer found work with other harmonica players, such as [[Shakey Jake Harris]], Harmonica Fats (pseudonym for Harvey Blackston; 1927\u20132000), and [[Rod Piazza]].<ref name=\"Blind Pig\"/> Dyer released a couple of [[single (music)|singles]] including \"Overdose of Love\"<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.bobcorritore.com/photos109.html |title=Photos &#124; Bob Corritore - Official Website |publisher=Bob Corritore |date= |accessdate=2014-01-26}}</ref> and, in 1983, issued the ''Johnny Dyer and the LA Jukes'' album.<ref name=\"Oldies\"/> The Scandinavian [[record label]], Black Magic featured Dyer on their ''Hard Times: L.A. Blues Anthology'' [[compilation album]].<ref name=\"Blind Pig\"/> \n\nDyer later collaborated with guitarist [[Rick Holmstrom]], and together they issued two albums on [[Black Top Records]]: ''Listen Up'' (1994) and ''Shake It!'' (1995). ''Listen Up'' included Dyer's [[cover version]] of the [[blues standard]], \"[[Driftin' Blues]]\".<ref name=\"Listen Up\">{{cite web|author=Char Ham |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/listen-up-mw0000123017 |title=Listen Up - Johnny Dyer &#124; Songs, Reviews, Credits, Awards |publisher=AllMusic |date= |accessdate=2014-01-26}}</ref> The album, ''Jukin''', also released in 1995, was a re-issue of Dyer's debut LP with additional tracks.<ref name=\"Blind Pig\">{{cite web |url=http://www.blindpigrecords.com/index.cfm?section=artists&artistid=27 |title=Johnny Dyer |author=|publisher=Blindpigrecords.com|accessdate=October 17, 2010}}</ref> It contained Dyer's version of \"[[Baby What You Want Me to Do]]\".<ref name=\"Jukin'\">{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/jukin-mw0000185915 |title=Jukin' - Johnny Dyer &#124; Songs, Reviews, Credits, Awards |publisher=AllMusic |date= |accessdate=2014-01-26}}</ref>\n\nDyer appeared on the bill at the [[Long Beach Blues Festival]] in 2000, where he sang alongside [[James Cotton]]. Over the years he has also been a featured performer on [[Mark Hummel]]'s annual Blues Harmonica Blowout tours.\n\nDyer received a [[Blues Music Award]] nomination in 2004, in the 'Blues Song Of The Year' category, for the track \"Hard Times Won.\" He has also spent time in recent years playing with [[The Mannish Boys]], and has appeared on a number of their album releases.<ref name=\"Delta\">{{cite web |url=http://deltagrooveproductions.com/music/artists/johnny_dyer/main.html |title=Johnny Dyer|author=|publisher=Deltagrooveproductions.com |accessdate=October 17, 2010}}</ref>\n\nDyer's most recent album was ''Rolling Fork Revisited'' (2004), recorded with [[Mark Hummel]].
