When Wolf relocated from Memphis to Chicago in 1953, his long-time guitarist [[Willie Johnson (guitarist)|Willie Johnson]] chose not to join him. Upon his arrival in Chicago, Wolf first hired Chicago guitarist [[Jody Williams (blues musician)|Jody Williams]], and in 1954 Wolf invited Sumlin to relocate to Chicago to play second guitar in his Chicago-based band.  Williams left the band in 1955, leaving Sumlin as the primary guitarist, a position he held almost continuously (except for a brief spell playing with [[Muddy Waters]] around 1956) for the remainder of Wolf's career. According to Sumlin, Howlin' Wolf sent Sumlin to a classical guitar instructor at the [[The Music Conservatory of Chicago College of Performing Arts|Chicago Conservatory of Music]] for a while to learn the keyboards and scales.<ref>{{cite book |title= Moanin' at Midnight: The Life and Times of Howlin' Wolf |last= Segrest|first= James |author2=Mark Hoffman |year= 2004, 2005 |publisher= Thunder's Mouth Press |location= New York |isbn= 1-56025-683-4 |pages= 111\u2013112}}</ref> Sumlin played on the album ''[[Howlin' Wolf (album)|Howlin' Wolf]]'', also called ''The Rockin' Chair Album'', which was named the third greatest guitar album of all time by ''[[Mojo (magazine)|Mojo]]'' magazine in 2004.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/hendrix-heads-list-of-100-guitar-greats-with-are-you-experienced-587496.html |title=Hendrix heads list of 100 guitar greats with 'Are You Experienced' |last1=Barnes |first1=Anthony |date=21 July 2003 |work=The Independent |accessdate=20 February 2010 |location=London}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/culture-obituaries/music-obituaries/8939083/Hubert-Sumlin.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | title=Hubert Sumlin | date=December 6, 2011}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Hubert Sumlin.jpg|thumb|220px|left|Sumlin performing in France on December 17, 1975.
