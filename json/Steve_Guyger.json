Personnel came and went and he changed the name of the band to the Excellos in 1980, who steadily built up a growing reputation playing in both Philadelphia and New York.<ref name=\"Bluesart\"/> Guyger started backing Jimmy Rogers in 1980, and played with him until just before Rogers' death in 1997.<ref name=\"stlblues1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.stlblues.net/reviews_steveguyger_radioblues.htm |title=STLBlues Reviews - Steve Guyger - Radio Blues |publisher=Stlblues.net |date= |accessdate=2013-03-20}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Doc Rock |url=http://thedeadrockstarsclub.com/1996.html |title=The Dead Rock Stars Club 1996 - 1997 |publisher=Thedeadrockstarsclub.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-20}}</ref> That same year Guyger's debut album, ''Last Train to Dover'', was released.<ref name=\"AMG\"/>\n\nIn 1999, [[Severn Records]] released Guyger's third album, ''Past Life Blues''.<ref name=\"AMG\"/><ref name=\"Bluesmgt\">{{cite web|url=http://www.bluesmgtgroup.com/pub/clients/Steve_Guyger/index.html |title=Steve Guyger & The Excellos |publisher=Bluesmgtgroup.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-20}}</ref>\n\nIn 2008, Guyger performed at the Lucerne Blues Festival.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bluesfestival.ch/v2/index.php/de/artists/category/artists-2008 |title=Lucerne Blues Festival 2012 - Artists 2008 |publisher=Bluesfestival.ch |date= |accessdate=2013-03-20}}</ref> His most recent album, ''Radio Blues'' was released in March the same year to critical acclaim.<ref name=\"stlblues1\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.acousticmusic.com/fame/p05813.htm |title=Fame Review: Steve Guyger - Radio Blues |publisher=Acousticmusic.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-20}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Henderson |first=Alex |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/radio-blues-mw0000503914 |title=Radio Blues - Steve Guyger : Songs, Reviews, Credits, Awards |publisher=AllMusic |date=2008-03-18 |accessdate=2013-03-20}}</ref> His guest musicians included [[Johnny Moeller]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/radio-blues-mw0000503914/credits |title=Radio Blues - Steve Guyger : Credits |publisher=AllMusic |date=2008-03-18 |accessdate=2013-03-20}}</ref> The following year his work saw Guyger nominated for a [[Blues Music Award]].<ref name=\"Steve\">{{cite web|url=http://www.steveguyger.com/ |title=Steve Guyger |publisher=Steveguyger.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-20}}</ref>\n\nIn 2010, he issued an instructional [[DVD]], entitled ''Blues Harmonica'', published by the [[Hal Leonard Corporation]].
