His family moved to [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]], when Bishop was ten. There he attended [[Will Rogers High School]], winning a full scholarship to the [[University of Chicago]] as a [[National Merit Scholarship Program|National Merit Scholar]] finalist. He moved to Chicago in 1960 to attend the university, where he majored in  [[physics]]. In 1963, he met [[harmonica]] player [[Paul Butterfield]] in the neighborhood of [[Hyde Park, Chicago|Hyde Park]] and joined Butterfield's [[blues]] [[band (music)|band]], with whom he remained for five years. Their third [[album]], ''[[The Resurrection of Pigboy Crabshaw]]'', takes its name from Bishop's nickname.<ref name=\"amg\"/> In 1968 he went [[solo (music)|solo]] and formed the Elvin Bishop Group, also performing with [[Mike Bloomfield]] and [[Al Kooper]] on their album titled ''[[The Live Adventures of Mike Bloomfield and Al Kooper]]''. The group signed with Fillmore Records, which was owned by [[Bill Graham (promoter)|Bill Graham]], who also owned the Fillmore music venues.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rockandrollroadmap.com/san-francisco-area-studios/fillmore-records/view-details.html|title=Fillmore Records|publisher= Rock and Roll Map|accessdate=2 October 2011}}</ref>\n[[File:Elvin Bishop Group 1975.JPG|thumb|left|150px|Photo of the group in 1975.]]\nIn March 1971, The Elvin Bishop Group and [[The Allman Brothers Band]] co-billed a series of concerts at the [[Fillmore East]]. Bishop joined The Allman Brothers Band onstage for a rendition of his own song, \"Drunken Hearted Boy\". Over the years, Bishop has recorded with many other blues artists including [[Clifton Chenier]] and [[John Lee Hooker]]. In late 1975, he played guitar for a couple of tracks on [[Bo Diddley]]'s ''The 20th Anniversary of Rock 'n' Roll'' album, and in 1995, he toured with [[B.B. King]].<ref name=\"amg\"/>\n\nBishop made an impression on [[album-oriented rock]] FM radio stations with \"Travelin' Shoes\" in 1975,<ref>[http://www.answers.com/topic/elvin-bishop Answers.com]</ref> but a year later, in 1976, Bishop released his most memorable [[single (music)|single]], \"[[Fooled Around and Fell in Love]]\", which peaked at #3 in the [[United States|U.S.]] [[Billboard Hot 100]] [[record chart|chart]] (and #34 in the UK charts).

The song was featured in the films ''[[Summer of Sam]]'', ''[[Boogie Nights]]'', ''[[The Devil's Rejects]]'', and ''[[Harold & Kumar Escape from Guantanamo Bay]]''.\n\nBishop feels that the limitations of his voice have helped his songwriting.<ref>\n{{cite web\n  | title = Elvin Bishop Interview\n  | work = Songfacts\n  | url = http://www.songfacts.com/int/2007/09/elvin-bishop.html}}</ref>\n\n[[File:ElvinBishopFeb06.jpg|thumb|220px|Bishop performing at the Riverwalk Blues Festival, [[Fort Lauderdale, Florida]], in February 2006]]\nBishop appeared at the 1984 [[Long Beach Blues Festival]].
