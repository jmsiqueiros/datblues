In 1974 [[Count Basie]] called Roomful \"the hottest blues band I've ever heard\". In 1975 Roomful signed a [[recording contract]] with [[Island Records]], thanks to support from [[Doc Pomus]]. After 16 years and 7 albums with Roomful, Copley relocated to [[Europe]] in 1984, where he still travels and performs extensively.\n\nStrongly influenced by the music of [[Big Joe Turner]], Copley's solo style spans several genres and defies categorisation, including (but certainly not limited to) [[Swing (genre)|swing]], [[Boogie-woogie (music)|boogie-woogie]] and [[barrelhouse]]. Live performances are characterised by their energy and Copley's acrobatic approach to piano performance, in the style of [[Jerry Lee Lewis]].\n\nCopley has performed and recorded with [[Lou Rawls]], the [[The Fabulous Thunderbirds]], [[Stevie Ray Vaughan]], [[Ruth Brown]], [[Jimmy Witherspoon]], [[Snooks Eaglin]], [[John Hammond Jr.]], [[Big Mama Thornton]], [[George \"Harmonica\" Smith]], [[Otis Rush]], [[Big Walter Horton]], [[Helen Humes]], [[Benny Waters]], [[Hal Singer]], [[Arnett Cobb]], [[Scott Hamilton (musician)|Scott Hamilton]], [[Big Jay McNeely]], [[Roy Brown (blues musician)|Roy \"Good Rockin\" Brown]] and a host of others.\n\n==Solo albums==\n*''Radio Play'' (2005), One Mind Records OM1205\n*''Jump On It'' (2003), One Mind Records OM1204\n*''Rainy Summer'' (2000), One Mind Records OM1203\n*''Blue Paris Nights'' (1995), One Mind Records OM1202\n*''Live at Montreux'' (1994), One Mind Records OM1201\n*''Good Understanding'' (1995), Al Copley & the Fabulous Thunderbirds, Bullseye Blues Records BB9596, original edition same title (1993), Suffering Egos SE754\n*''Royal Blue'' (1991), Al Copley & Hal Singer, Black Top Records BT1054\n*''Rockabilly Pie'' (1990), Suffering Egos Records SE753\n*''Acoustic 88'' (1988), Suffering Egos SE752\n*''Automatic Overdrive'' (1989), [[Black Top Records|Black Top]] BT 1047, original edition entitled ''Ooh-Wow!!''
