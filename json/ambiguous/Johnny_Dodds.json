The pair worked together in the New Orleans Bootblacks in 1926.\n\nBorn in [[Waveland, Mississippi]], [[United States]], he moved to New Orleans in his youth, and studied clarinet with [[Lorenzo Tio]].  He played with the bands of [[Frankie Duson]], [[Kid Ory]], and [[Joe \"King\" Oliver]].  Dodds went to [[Chicago]] and played with Oliver's Creole Jazz Band, with which he first recorded in 1923. Dodds also worked frequently with his good friend [[Natty Dominique]] during this period, a professional relationship that would last a lifetime. After the breakup of Oliver's band in 1924, Dodds replaced [[Alcide Nunez]] as the house clarinetist and bandleader of [[Kelly's Stables (Chicago)|Kelly's Stables]].  He recorded with numerous small groups in Chicago, most notably Louis Armstrong's [[Hot Five]] and [[Hot Seven]], and Jelly Roll Morton's [[Red Hot Peppers]].\n\nNoted for his professionalism and virtuosity as a musician, and his heartfelt, heavily blues-laden style, Dodds was an important influence on later clarinetists, notably [[Benny Goodman]].\n\nDodds did not record for most of the 1930s, affected by ill health.
