He was born '''William George Tucker'''<ref>[http://www.wirz.de/music/barbefrm.htm Wirz.de/music biography]</ref> in [[Henning, Tennessee|Henning]], [[Tennessee]], [[United States]],<ref name=\"amg\"/> and changed his name with the commencement of his [[sound recording and reproduction|recording]] career to reflect his favorite [[folk music|folk]] [[song]], \"[[John Henry (folklore)|The Ballad of John Henry]]\".\n\n==Biography==\nBarbee toured in the 1930s throughout the [[Southern United States|American South]] singing and playing [[slide guitar]]. He teamed up with [[Big Joe Williams]], and later on, with [[Sunnyland Slim]] in [[Memphis, Tennessee]].  Travelling down to [[Mississippi]] he also came across [[Sonny Boy Williamson I]], and played with him off and on for several years. He released two sides on the [[Vocalion Records|Vocalion]] [[record label|label]] in 1939 (\"Six Weeks Old Blues\" / \"God Knows I Can't Help It\"). The [[gramophone record|record]] sold well enough to cause Vocalion to call on Barbee again, but by that time he had left his last known whereabouts in [[Arkansas]]. Barbee explained that this sudden move was due to his evading the law for shooting and killing his girlfriend's lover. He later found out that he had only injured the man, but by the time this was discovered, Barbee had moved on from making a career out of playing music.  \n\nBarbee did not show up again in the [[music industry]] until the early 1960s, whereby this time the blues revival was in full swing. [[Willie Dixon]] searched out for Barbee, and found him working as an ice-cream server in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]]. In 1964 he joined the [[American Folk Blues Festival]] on an [[Europe]]an tour with fellow blues players, including [[Lightnin' Hopkins]] and [[Howlin' Wolf]].<ref name=\"amg\"/>\n\nIn a case of tragic circumstances, Barbee returned to the [[United States]] and used the money from the tour to purchase his first [[automobile]]. Only ten days after purchasing the car, he accidentally ran over and killed a man. He was locked up in a Chicago jail, and died there of a [[heart attack]] a few days later, November 3, 1964, 11 days before his 59th birthday.  \n\nHe is interred in the [[Burr Oak Cemetery and Restvale Cemetery|Restvale Cemetery]] in [[Alsip, Illinois]].\n\nOn May 11, 2010, the third annual White Lake Blues Festival took place at the Howmet Playhouse Theater in [[Whitehall, Michigan]]. The concert was organized by executive producer Steve Salter, of the non-profit organization ''Killer Blues'', in order to raise monies to honor Barbee's unmarked grave with a headstone. The event was a success, and a stone was placed in June 2010.\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of blues musicians]]\n*[[List of Delta blues musicians]]\n*[[List of country blues musicians]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n*Oliver, Paul and Chris Albertson.
