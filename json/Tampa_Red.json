His songwriting and his silky, polished \"bottleneck\" technique influenced other leading Chicago blues guitarists, such as [[Big Bill Broonzy]] and [[Robert Nighthawk]], as well as [[Muddy Waters]], [[Elmore James]], [[Mose Allison]] and many others.<ref name= barlow>Barlow, William.

His parents died when he was a child, and he moved to [[Tampa, Florida|Tampa]], [[Florida]], where he was raised by his aunt and grandmother and adopted their surname, Whittaker.<ref name=\"russell\">{{cite book\n| first= Tony\n| last= Russell\n| year= 1997\n| title= The Blues - From [[Robert Johnson (musician)|Robert Johnson]] to [[Robert Cray]]\n| edition= \n| publisher=Carlton Books Limited \n| location= Dubai\n| pages= 173\u2013174\n| isbn= 1-85868-255-X}}</ref>  He emulated his older brother, Eddie, who played guitar, and he was especially inspired by an old street musician called Piccolo Pete, who first taught him to play blues licks on a guitar.<ref name= barlow/>\n\nIn the 1920s, having already perfected his slide technique, he moved to [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]], and began his career as a musician, adopting the name 'Tampa Red' from his childhood home and light colored skin.<ref name=\"russell\"/>  His big break was being hired to accompany [[Ma Rainey]] and he began recording in 1928 with \"It's Tight Like That\", in a bawdy and humorous style that became known as \"[[hokum]]\".<ref name=\"russell\"/> Early recordings were mostly collaborations with [[Thomas A. Dorsey]], known at the time as Georgia Tom.<ref name=\"russell\"/> Tampa Red and Georgia Tom recorded almost 90 sides, sometimes as \"The Hokum Boys\" or, with [[Frankie Jaxon]], as \"Tampa Red's Hokum Jug Band\".  \n\nIn 1928, Tampa Red became the first black musician to play a [[National String Instrument Corporation|National]] steel-bodied [[resonator guitar]], the loudest and showiest guitar available before amplification, acquiring one in the first year they were available. This allowed him to develop his trademark bottleneck style, playing single string runs, not block chords, which was a precursor to later blues and rock guitar soloing.<ref>[http://nfo.net/usa/t1.html American Big Bands - Page 1 of 'T' Bands Index<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The National guitar he used was a gold-plated tricone, which was found in Illinois in the 1990s by music-shop owner and guitarist Randy Clemens and later sold to the \"Experience Music Project\" in [[Seattle]].<ref>Stephen Carradini, ''From Red To Randy'', Oklahoma Gazette [Oklahoma City], April 6, 2011, 57.</ref>  Tampa Red was known as \"The Man With The Gold Guitar\", and, into the 1930s, he was billed as \"The Guitar Wizard\".\n\nHis partnership with Dorsey ended in 1932, but he remained much in demand as a [[session musician]], working with [[Sonny Boy Williamson I|John Lee \"Sonny Boy\" Williamson]], [[Memphis Minnie]], [[Big Maceo]], and many others.<ref name=\"russell\"/>  In 1934 he signed for [[Victor Records]], remaining on their artist roster until 1953. He formed the Chicago Five, a group of session musicians who created what became known as the Bluebird sound, a precursor of the small group style of later jump blues and rock and roll bands.<ref name=\"russell\"/>  He was a close friend and associate of Big Bill Broonzy and [[Big Maceo Merriweather]]. He enjoyed commercial success and reasonable prosperity, and his home became a centre for the blues community, informally providing rehearsal space, bookings, and lodgings for the flow of musicians who arrived in Chicago from the [[Mississippi Delta]] as the commercial potential of blues music grew and agricultural employment in the south diminished.\n\nBy the 1940s he was playing electric guitar. In 1942 \"Let Me Play With Your Poodle\" was a # 4 hit on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'''s new \"Harlem Hit Parade\", forerunner of the [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs|R&B chart]], and his 1949 recording \"When Things Go Wrong with You (It Hurts Me Too)\", another R&B hit, was covered by [[Elmore James]].  He was 'rediscovered' in the late 1950s, like many other surviving early recorded blues artists such as [[Son House]] and [[Skip James]], as part of the blues revival. His final recordings were in 1960. \n\nHe became an alcoholic after his wife's death in 1953.<ref>Nigel Williamson, ''Rough Guide to the Blues'', 2007.</ref> He died destitute in Chicago, aged 77.\n\n==Discography==\nTampa Red was one of the most prolific blues recording artists of his era.
