For example, the guitarist and singer Sonny Scott recorded fourteen tracks for [[Vocalion Records|Vocalion]] in 1933, all of them backed by Roland.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sundayblues.org/archives/tag/alabama-blues |title=Alabama Blues|author= |publisher=Sundayblues.org|accessdate=October 26, 2010}}</ref> The tracks included two [[instrumental]]s (\"Guitar Stomp\" and \"Railroad Stomp\"), billed on [[Gramophone record|record]] as the Jolly Two, where Roland matched Scott's guitar work.<ref name=\"AMG 2\"/>\n\n[[Lucille Bogan]] was usually accompanied by Roland on piano, although he sometimes played an [[acoustic guitar]] backing.<ref name=\"Russell\">{{cite book\n| first= Tony\n| last= Russell\n| year= 1997\n| title= The Blues: From Robert Johnson to Robert Cray\n| edition= \n| publisher= Carlton Books Limited \n| location= Dubai\n| isbn= 1-85868-255-X\n| page= 10}}</ref> She was also in New York in 1933, and, apparently to conceal her identity, began recording as Bessie Jackson for Banner Records. She recorded over 100 songs between 1933 and 1935, including some of her biggest commercial successes such as \"Seaboard Blues\", \"Troubled Mind\", and \"Superstitious Blues\". \n\nDuring this same period Roland also accompanied [[Josh White]] on several tracks.<ref name=\"AMG\"/>\n\nBogan's final recordings with Roland and White included two takes of \"Shave 'Em Dry\", recorded in New York on Tuesday March 5, 1935.  The unexpurgated alternate take is notorious for its explicit sexual references, a unique record of the lyrics sung in after-hours adult clubs.<ref name=williamson>Nigel Williamson, ''The Rough Guide to The Blues'', 2007, ISBN 1-84353-519-X</ref><ref name=\"Russell 4\">{{cite book\n| first= Tony\n| last= Russell\n| year= 1997\n| title= The Blues: From Robert Johnson to Robert Cray\n| edition= \n| publisher= Carlton Books Limited \n| location= Dubai\n| isbn= 1-85868-255-X\n| page= 94}}</ref> \n\nRoland did not record beyond this point and, by 1950, had become a farmer, then known by the [[nickname]]s of 'Old Soul' and 'Shave 'Em Dry'. In the 1960s, Roland also operated as a street musician for several years, but accidentally lost his sight after intervening in a neighbor's argument, which saw him inadvertently hit by [[buckshot]]. In the late 1960s Roland retired to [[Fairfield, Alabama]], and was cared for by his daughters, having earlier being widowed.<ref name=\"Delta\"/>\n\nHe died of [[lung cancer]] on October 12, 1972 in Fairfield.<ref name=\"Delta\"/>\n\nApart from those musicians mentioned earlier, Roland's songs have been recorded by notables such as [[Sonny Boy Williamson II]], [[Big Joe Williams]], [[Booker T.
