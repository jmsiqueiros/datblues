Her father was a part-time musician and a [[Wigwag (railroad)|flagman]] for the [[Rail transport|railroad]]; her mother was a [[nurse]]. Her sisters were Addie \"Sweet Peas\" Spivey (1910\u20131943), also a singer and musician, who recorded for several major [[record label]]s between 1929 and 1937; and Elton Island Spivey (1900\u20131971), who also sang professionally.<ref name=\"russell\">{{cite book\n| first= Tony\n| last= Russell\n| year= 1997\n| title= The Blues - From Robert Johnson to Robert Cray\n| edition= \n| publisher=Carlton Books Limited \n| location= Dubai\n| pages= 168\u201369\n| isbn= 1-85868-255-X}}</ref>\n\nSpivey's first professional experience was in a family string band led by her father in Houston. After Grant Spivey died, the seven-year-old Victoria played on her own at local parties and, in 1918, was hired to accompany films at the Lincoln Theater in [[Dallas, Texas|Dallas]].<ref>Harrison, Daphne Duval (1990). ''Black Pearls: blues queens of the 1920s''. New Brunswick and London: Rutgers. p. 149. ISBN 0-8135-1280-8</ref> As a teenager, she worked in local bars, [[nightclub]]s, and buffet flats, mostly alone, but occasionally with singer-guitarists such as [[Blind Lemon Jefferson]].<ref name=\"Trail\"/> In 1926, she moved to [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]], [[Missouri]], where she was signed by [[Okeh Records]]. Her first [[sound recording and reproduction|recording]], \"Black Snake Blues\", did well, and her association with the [[record label]] continued. She made numerous Okeh sides in [[New York City|New York]] until 1929, then switched to the [[RCA Records|RCA Victor]] label. Between 1931 and 1937, more recordings followed on the [[Vocalion Records|Vocalion]] and [[Decca Records|Decca]] labels,<ref name=\"Trail\"/> and, working out of New York, she maintained an active performance schedule. Spivey's recorded accompanists included [[Joe \"King\" Oliver|King Oliver]], [[Louis Armstrong]], [[Lonnie Johnson (musician)|Lonnie Johnson]], and [[Red Allen]].<ref name=\"russell\"/>\n\nThe [[Great Depression|Depression]] did not put an end to Spivey's musical career; she found a new outlet for her talent in the year of the crash, when [[film director]] [[King Vidor]] cast her to play \"Missy Rose\" in his first sound [[film]], ''[[Hallelujah! (1929 film)|Hallelujah!]]'' (1929).<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0019959/| title = Hallelujah!| accessdate = March 2, 2012| publisher = IMDB.com}}</ref> Through the 1930s and 1940s, Spivey continued to work in [[musical film]]s and [[stage show]]s, often with her husband, [[vaudeville]] [[dance]]r Billy Adams, including the ''Hellzapoppin' Revue''.<ref name=\"Trail\"/>\n\nIn 1951, Spivey retired from [[show business]] to play the [[pipe organ]] and lead a [[church choir]], but she returned to [[secular music]] in 1961, when she was reunited with an old singing partner, Lonnie Johnson, to appear on four tracks on his [[Bluesville Records|Prestige Bluesville]] [[album]], ''Idle Hours''. The [[folk music]] revival of the 1960s gave her further opportunities to make at least a semblance of a comeback. She recorded again for Prestige Bluesville, sharing an album ''Songs We Taught Your Mother'' with fellow veterans [[Alberta Hunter]] and [[Lucille Hegamin]] and began making personal appearances at festivals and clubs.\n\nIn 1962, Spivey and [[jazz]] [[historian]] [[Len Kunstadt]] launched [[Spivey Records]], a low-budget label dedicated to blues and related music. They recorded prolifically such performers as [[Sippie Wallace]], Lucille Hegamin, [[Otis Rush]], [[Otis Spann]], [[Willie Dixon]], [[Roosevelt Sykes]], [[Big Joe Turner]], [[Buddy Tate (musician)|Buddy Tate]] and [[Hannah Sylvester]], as well as newer artists including [[Luther Johnson (Guitar Junior)|Luther Johnson]], Brenda Bell, Washboard Doc, Bill Dicey, [[Robert Ross (singer)|Robert Ross]], [[Sugar Blue]], [[Paul Oscher]], Danny Russo and [[Larry Johnson (musician)|Larry Johnson]].<ref name=\"Trail\"/>\n\nIn March 1962, [[Bob Dylan]] contributed harmonica and back-up vocals, accompanying Victoria Spivey and [[Big Joe Williams]] on a recording for Spivey Records.  The recordings were released on ''Three Kings And The Queen'' (Spivey LP 1004) and ''Kings And The Queen Volume Two'' (Spivey LP 1014). (Dylan was listed under his own name on the record covers.)<ref>Gray, Michael. ''The Bob Dylan Encyclopedia'' (2006), 630-631</ref> In 1964 Spivey made her only recording with an all-white band: the [[Connecticut]] based Easy Riders Jazz Band, led by [[Trombone|trombonist]] [[Big Bill Bissonnette]]. It was released first on an [[Gramophone record|LP]] and later re-released on [[compact disc]].\n\nSpivey married four times; her husbands included Ruben Floyd and Billy Adams.<ref name = \"emory\"/>\n\nVictoria Spivey died in New York on October 3, 1976, at the age of 69, from an [[bleeding|internal haemorrhage]].<ref name=\"allmusic\"/><ref name=\"NME Rock 'N' Roll Years\">{{cite book\n| first= John\n| last= Tobler\n| year= 1992\n| title= NME Rock 'N' Roll Years\n| edition= 1st\n| publisher= Reed International Books Ltd \n| location= London\n| page= 293\n| id= CN 5585}}</ref>\n\n==Selected discography==\n{{Expand section|date=May 2010}}\n*[http://folkways.si.edu/albumdetails.aspx?itemid=453 ''Music Down Home: An Introduction to Negro Folk Music, U.S.A.''
