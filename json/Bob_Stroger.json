Stroger was inspired by the sights and sounds emanating from the club.  Subsequently he was further encouraged to try to have a career in music, after being casually employed driving his brother-in-law to play in a blues band alongside [[J. B. Hutto]].<ref name=\"Today\"/>  Self-taught in the art of guitar playing, Stroger got together a family based band known as the Red Tops, named after wearing black berets with a red circle daubed on top. When [[Willie Kent]] was drafted to boost their proficiency, the combo was renamed Joe Russell and the Blues Hustlers. Stroger had adopted the [[stage name]] of Joe Russell, although this did not endure.<ref name=\"AMG\"/> He moved on to play [[jazz]] for a period with Rufus Forman, but it was his meeting with [[Eddie King (musician)|Eddie King]] which started his lengthy career playing blues.  Having now adopted playing bass guitar, Stroger played on King's [[Single (music)|single]] \"Love You Baby\" (1965).<ref name=\"Today\"/>\n\nHe backed King for fifteen years before King relocated, which caused Stroger to stop his playing for a couple of years.<ref name=\"AMG\"/>  His interest was rekindled when he was recommended to [[Otis Rush]], whom he backed in the late 1970s and 1980s.<ref name=\"airwayrecords1\">{{cite web|url=http://airwayrecords.com/bob-is-back-in-town/ |title=Bob is Back in Town \u00ab Airway Records |publisher=Airwayrecords.com |date=1907-09-05 |accessdate=2013-03-07}}</ref> He toured Europe with Rush and played on a couple of his albums, ''Live in Europe'' and ''Lost in the Blues''.<ref name=\"Today\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/lost-in-the-blues-mw0000263196/credits |title=Lost in the Blues - Otis Rush : Credits |publisher=AllMusic |date= |accessdate=2013-03-07}}</ref>\n\nStroger became a [[session musician]] for a while, and worked with [[Sunnyland Slim]]<ref name=\"Today\"/> and [[Mississippi Heat]] during the late 1980s and early 1990s, before joining [[Odie Payne]] as the regular rhythm section for the series of American Blues Folk Festivals.<ref name=\"AMG\"/> Encouraged by Sunnyland Slim, Stroger began singing and writing his own material.<ref name=\"airwayrecords1\"/> In 1996, Stroger played on [[Mark Hummel]]'s album, ''Heart of Chicago''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/heart-of-chicago-mw0000091236/credits |title=Heart of Chicago - Mark Hummel : Credits |publisher=AllMusic |date=1997-01-14 |accessdate=2013-03-07}}</ref> In 1997, Stroger played bass on [[Golden \"Big\" Wheeler]]'s album, ''Jump In''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/jump-in-mw0000597358/credits |title=Jump In - Big Wheeler : Credits |publisher=AllMusic |date= |accessdate=2013-03-07}}</ref> The following year, Stroger played with a group of musicians at the Lucerne Blues Festival in Switzerland.
