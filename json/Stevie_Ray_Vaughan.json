In spite of a short-lived mainstream career spanning seven years, he is widely considered one of the most influential electric guitarists in the history of blues music, and one of the most important figures in the revival of blues in the 1980s. [[Allmusic]] describes him as \"a rocking powerhouse of a guitarist who gave blues a burst of momentum in the '80s, with influence still felt long after his tragic death.\"<ref name=\"Allmusic\">{{cite web|title=Biography of Stevie Ray Vaughan|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/stevie-ray-vaughan-mn0000625739/biography|publisher=Allmusic|accessdate=March 23, 2014}}</ref><!--quotations should always be supported with an in-line citation, see WP:Leadcite.-->\n\nBorn and raised in [[Dallas]], Texas, Vaughan began playing guitar at the age of seven, inspired by his older brother [[Jimmie Vaughan|Jimmie]]. In 1971, he dropped out of high school and moved to [[Austin, Texas|Austin]] the following year. He played gigs with numerous bands, earning a spot in [[Marc Benno]]'s band, the Nightcrawlers, and later with [[Denny Freeman]] in the Cobras, with whom he continued to work through late 1977. He then formed his own group, Triple Threat Revue, before renaming the band [[Double Trouble (band)|Double Trouble]] after hiring drummer [[Chris Layton]] and bassist [[Tommy Shannon]]. He gained fame after his performance at the [[Montreux Jazz Festival]] in 1982, and in 1983 his debut studio album, ''[[Texas Flood]]'', charted at number 38. The ten-song album was a commercially successful release that sold over half-a-million copies. After achieving sobriety in late 1986, he headlined concert tours with [[Jeff Beck]] in 1989 and [[Joe Cocker]] in 1990 before his death in a helicopter crash on August 27, 1990, at the age of 35.\n\nVaughan was inspired musically by American and British [[blues rock]]. He favored clean amplifiers with high volume and contributed to the popularity of vintage musical equipment. He often combined several different amplifiers together and used minimal [[Effects unit|effects pedals]]. Chris Gill of ''[[Guitar World]]'' commented: \"Stevie Ray Vaughan's guitar tone was as dry as a San Antonio summer and as sparkling clean as a Dallas debutante, the product of the natural sound of amps with ample clean headroom. However, Vaughan occasionally used pedals to augment his sound, mainly to boost the signal, although he occasionally employed a rotating speaker cabinet and wah pedals for added textural flair.\"{{sfn|Gill|2013}}\n\nVaughan received several music awards during his lifetime and posthumously. In 1983, readers of ''[[Guitar Player]]'' voted him as Best New Talent and Best Electric Blues Guitar Player. In 1984, the [[Blues Foundation]] named him Entertainer of the Year and Blues Instrumentalist of the Year, and in 1987 ''Performance Magazine'' honored him with Rhythm and Blues Act of the Year. Earning six [[Grammy Award]]s and ten Austin Music Awards, he was inducted into the [[Blues Hall of Fame]] in 2000 and the [[Musicians Hall of Fame and Museum|Musicians Hall of Fame]] in 2014. ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' ranked Vaughan as the twelfth greatest guitarist of all time.\n\n==Family and early life==\n[[File:Robert Hodgen LaRue, Jr..jpg|thumb|upright=.75|Vaughan's paternal great-grandfather, Robert Hodgen LaRue, circa 1900s|alt=A black and white image (c.1900s) of an elderly man with white hair and a long beard dressed in a long-sleeved and suspenders standing in front of a tree.]]\n\nVaughan's ancestry has been traced as far back as the nineteenth century, to his great-grandfather Robert Hodgen LaRue. Robert had a daughter named Laura Belle LaRue, Vaughan's paternal grandmother.{{refn|group=nb|Vaughan's paternal grandmother, Laura Belle LaRue, was a sharecropper who moved to Rockwall County, Texas from Terrell after marrying her husband, Thomas Lee Vaughan, on July 13, 1902. She gave birth to nine children, eight of whom survived infancy. On Sundays, Laura would gather her children around her piano in the living room, singing hymns and popular standards. In 1928, Thomas passed away from [[Bright's disease]] and left Laura's family to pick cotton for a living at the beginning of the [[Great Depression]].<ref>{{harvnb|Patoski|Crawford|1993|p=3}}</ref>}} She married a man from Arkansas named Thomas Lee Vaughan. They moved onto a region of land in [[Rockwall County, Texas|Rockwall County]] and made their living off of sharecropping.<ref>{{harvnb|Patoski|Crawford|1993|p=5}}</ref> On September 6, 1921, Thomas and Laura had a son they named Jimmie Lee Vaughan; people called him Jim.<ref>{{harvnb|Hopkins|2011|p=4}}</ref>\n\nJim, who dropped out of school at the age of sixteen, enlisted to serve with the United States Navy on the outbreak of [[World War II]]. After returning from service, Jim met Martha Cook (1928\u20132009) while working as an attendant at a [[7-Eleven]] convenience store in Dallas; they married on January 13, 1950.<ref>{{harvnb|Patoski|Crawford|1993|p=6}}: Big Jim and Martha meeting at a 7-Eleven in the late 1940s; {{harvnb|Patoski|Crawford|1993|p=8}}: Big Jim and Martha married in 1950.</ref> Stephen Ray Vaughan was born on October 3, 1954, in Dallas, Texas; he was three-and-a-half years younger than his brother [[Jimmie Vaughan|Jimmie]] (born 1951). Jim secured a job as an [[asbestos]] worker, an occupation that involved rigorous, manual effort. The family frequently moved, living in other states such as Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Oklahoma before ultimately moving to the [[Oak Cliff]] suburb of Dallas. A shy and insecure boy, Vaughan was deeply affected by his childhood experiences. Jim struggled with alcohol abuse, and often terrorized his family and friends with his bad temper. In later years, Vaughan recalled that he had been a victim of Jim's violence.<ref>{{harvnb|Patoski|Crawford|1993|pp=8\u20139}}: Jim's alcohol abuse and temper; {{harvnb|Patoski|Crawford|1993|p=42}}: Jim's violence</ref>\n\n==First instruments==\nIn the early 1960s, Vaughan's admiration for Jimmie resulted in him trying different instruments such as the drums and saxophone.<ref>{{harvnb|Patoski|Crawford|1993|p=10}}</ref>{{refn|group=nb|According to Vaughan, his first instrument was a drum set fashioned out of shoe boxes and pie pans, using clothes hangers as drum sticks. He also attempted playing saxophone, though Vaughan recalled: \"...&nbsp;all I could get were a few squeaks\".<ref>{{harvnb|Joseph|1983}}</ref>}} In 1961, for his seventh birthday, Vaughan received his first guitar, a toy with only three strings.{{refn|group=nb|This guitar was known as the \"[[Wyatt Earp]]\" model designed by Jefferson Manufacturing, a [[Philadelphia]]-based company. Available from 1959 to 1968, it was made out of fiberboard with a black to cream [[Sunburst (finish)|sunburst]] finish and red [[Screen printing|screen-printed]] Western designs.<ref>{{harvnb|Evans|Middlebrook|2002|pp=174, 200}}</ref>}} Learning by ear, he diligently committed himself, following along to songs by the Nightcaps, particularly \"Wine, Wine, Wine\" and \"Thunderbird\".<ref>{{harvnb|Hopkins|2010|p=8}}</ref>{{refn|group=nb|In the late 1950s, the Nightcaps were widely recognized as one of the first white blues groups from Dallas. Though they never gained national attention, the band became a fixture of the city's music scene.<ref>{{harvnb|Larkin|2006}}</ref>}} He listened to [[blues]] artists such as [[Albert King]], [[Otis Rush]], and [[Muddy Waters]], and rock guitarists such as [[Jimi Hendrix]] and [[Lonnie Mack]], as well as [[jazz]] guitarists including [[Kenny Burrell]].<ref>{{harvnb|Hopkins|2010|p=155}}</ref> In 1963, he acquired his first electric guitar, a [[Gibson ES-125|Gibson ES-125T]], as a hand-me-down from Jimmie.<ref>{{harvnb|Gill|2010}}</ref>\n\nSoon after he acquired the electric guitar, Vaughan joined his first band, the Chantones. Their first gig was at a talent contest held in Dallas' Hill Theatre, but after realizing that they could not perform a Jimmy Reed song in its entirety, Vaughan left the band and joined the Brooklyn Underground, playing professionally at local bars and clubs.<ref>{{harvnb|Hopkins|2010|p=10}}: Vaughan's first gig with the Chantones in 1965; {{harvnb|Hopkins|2010|p=16}}: Vaughan joining the Brooklyn Underground in 1967.</ref> He received Jimmie's [[Fender Telecaster|Fender Broadcaster]], which he later traded for an [[Epiphone]] Riviera.<ref>{{harvnb|Hopkins|2011|p=325}}</ref> When Jimmie left home at age sixteen, Vaughan's apparent obsession with the instrument caused a lack of support from his parents.<ref>{{harvnb|Patoski|Crawford|1993|p=22}}</ref> Miserable at home, he took a job at a local hamburger stand, where he washed dishes and dumped trash for seventy cents an hour. After falling into a barrel of grease, he had enough so he quit and devoted his life to a music career.<ref>{{harvnb|Hopkins|2010|p=16}}</ref>\n\n==Music career==\n\n===Early years===\nIn May 1969, after leaving the Brooklyn Underground, Vaughan joined a band called the Southern Distributor.<ref>{{harvnb|Hopkins|2010|p=19}}</ref> He had learned [[The Yardbirds]]' \"Jeff's Boogie\" and played the song at the audition. Mike Steinbach, the group's drummer, commented: \"The kid was fourteen. We auditioned him on 'Jeff's Boogie,' really fast instrumental guitar, and he played it note for note.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Hopkins|2010|p=22}}</ref> Although they played [[pop rock]] covers, Vaughan conveyed his interest in the addition of blues songs to the group's repertoire; he was told that he wouldn't earn a living playing blues music and the band parted ways.<ref>{{harvnb|Hopkins|2010|p=21}}: Vaughan being told that there was no money in blues; {{harvnb|Hopkins|2010|p=22}}: break-up of the Southern Distributor.</ref> Later that year, bassist [[Tommy Shannon]] walked into a Dallas club and heard Vaughan playing guitar.

Having spent the past month briefly playing bass with Jimmie in Texas Storm, he had originally auditioned as bassist. Impressed by Vaughan's guitar playing, Scott Phares, the group's original guitarist, modestly became the bassist.<ref>{{harvnb|Hopkins|2010|p=27}}</ref> In mid-1970, they performed at the [[Adolphus Hotel]] in downtown Dallas, where [[ZZ Top]] asked to perform. During Liberation's break, Vaughan jammed with ZZ Top on the Nightcaps song \"Thunderbird\". Phares later described the performance: \"They tore the house down. It was awesome. It was one of those magical evenings. Stevie fit in like a glove on a hand.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Hopkins|2010|p=31}}</ref>\n\nAttending [[Justin F. Kimball High School]] during the early 1970s, Vaughan's late-night gigs contributed to his neglect in his studies, including music theory; he would often sleep during class.<ref>{{harvnb|Patoski|Crawford|1993|p=40}}</ref> Although his musical career pursuit was disapproved by many of the school's administrators, he was encouraged by many to strive for a career in art, including his art teacher.<ref name=\"Patoski Crawford 41\">{{harvnb|Patoski|Crawford|1993|p=41}}</ref>{{refn|group=nb|Some of Vaughan's cartoons were published in his high school's newspaper.<ref name=\"Patoski Crawford 41\" />}} In his sophomore year, he attended an evening class for experimental art at [[Southern Methodist University]], but bailed when it conflicted with rehearsal.<ref name=\"Patoski Crawford 41\" /> Vaughan later spoke of his dislike of the school and stated that he had to receive a daily note from the principal about his grooming.<ref>{{harvnb|Hopkins|2010|p=24}}</ref>\n\n===First recordings===\nIn September 1970, Vaughan made his first studio recordings with the band Cast of Thousands, which included future actor [[Stephen Tobolowsky]]. They recorded two songs, \"Red, White and Blue\" and \"I Heard a Voice Last Night\", for a compilation album, ''A New Hi'', that featured various teenage bands from Dallas.<ref>{{harvnb|Hopkins|2010|pp=36\u201338}}</ref> In late January 1971, feeling confined by playing pop hits with Liberation, Vaughan formed his own band, Blackbird. After growing tired with the Dallas music scene, he dropped out of school and moved with the band to [[Austin, Texas]], which had more liberal and tolerant audiences. There, Vaughan initially took residence at the Rolling Hills Country Club, a venue that would later become the Soap Creek Saloon. Blackbird played at several clubs in Austin and opened shows for bands such as [[Sugarloaf (band)|Sugarloaf]], [[Wishbone Ash]], and [[Zephyr (band)|Zephyr]], but could not maintain a consistent lineup.<ref>{{harvnb|Hopkins|2010|p=61}}: Blackbird opening for Zephyr; {{harvnb|Hopkins|2010|p=63}}: Blackbird opening for Sugarloaf; {{harvnb|Hopkins|2010|p=65}}: Blackbird opening for Wishbone Ash; {{harvnb|Gill|2010}}: Blackbird's inconsistent lineup.</ref> By the end of the year, he joined a rock band, Krackerjack; he performed with them for less than three months.<ref>{{harvnb|Hopkins|2010|p=70}}</ref>\n\nIn March 1973, Vaughan joined [[Marc Benno]]'s band, the Nightcrawlers, after meeting Benno at a jam session years before.<ref>{{harvnb|Hopkins|2010|p=23}}: Vaughan meets Marc Benno at a jam session; {{harvnb|Hopkins|2010|p=73}}: Vaughan joins Marc Benno's band, the Nightcrawlers.</ref> The band featured vocalist [[Doyle Bramhall]], who met Vaughan when he was twelve years old.<ref>{{harvnb|Patoski|Crawford|1993|p=21}}</ref> The next month, Vaughan and the Nightcrawlers recorded an album at [[Sunset Sound Recorders]] in [[Hollywood]] for [[A&M Records]].

Layton, who had recently parted ways with [[Greezy Wheels]], was taught by Vaughan to play a [[Swing (jazz performance style)|shuffle rhythm]]. When Vaughan offered Layton the position, he agreed.<ref>{{harvnb|Patoski|Crawford|1993|p=114}}</ref> In early July, Vaughan befriended Lenora Bailey, known as \"Lenny\", who became his girlfriend, and ultimately his wife, a marriage that lasted for six and a half years.<ref name=\"Hopkins 2010 127\">{{harvnb|Hopkins|2010|p=127}}: Vaughan befriends Lenny; {{harvnb|Hopkins|2010|p=152}}: marriage to Lenny; {{harvnb|Hopkins|2011|p=136}}: separation from Lenny.</ref>{{refn|group=nb|Vaughan and Lenny married on December 23, 1979 at the Rome Inn, after he had a dream that Lenny was sitting on [[Howlin' Wolf]]'s knee.<ref>{{harvnb|Patoski|Crawford|1993|p=130}}</ref>}}\n\nIn early October 1978, Vaughan and Double Trouble earned a frequent residency performing at one of Austin's most popular nightspots, the Rome Inn.<ref name=\"Hopkins 2010 136\">{{harvnb|Hopkins|2010|p=136}}</ref> During a performance, Edi Johnson, an accountant at [[Manor Downs]], noticed Vaughan.<ref name=\"Hopkins 2010 136\" /> She remembered: \"I'm not an authority on music \u2014 it's whatever turned me on \u2014 but this did.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Patoski|Crawford|1993|p=134}}</ref> She recommended him to Manor Downs owner Frances Carr and general manager Chesley Millikin, who was interested in managing artists, and saw Vaughan's musical potential.

Shannon, who was playing with [[Alan Haynes]] at the time, participated in a jam session with Vaughan and Layton halfway through their set. Shannon later commented: \"I went down there that night, and I'll never forget this: it was like, when I walked in the door and I heard them playing, it was like a revelation \u2014 'That's where I want to be; that's where I belong, right there.'

His goal to improve his guitar playing on the album was largely driven by a desire to make better music, or as drummer Chris Layton put it, more \"essential music\".{{sfn|Hopkins|2011|p=200}} Many of the songs written for ''In Step'' were composed during the [[Live Alive Tour]].{{sfn|Hopkins|2011|p=194}} The album was stylistically unlike their previous albums, with less blues and more original, groove-oriented material.\n\nHis remake of the Stevie Wonder hit \"Superstition\" was a hit.  It even included a cameo from Stevie Wonder.  The ending of the video was changed after the death of Stevie Ray Vaughan.  Originally Stevie Ray Vaughan died in the video.  It also included Stevie Wonder saying \"That will teach them for messing with my song\".  They felt it was in bad taste with the passing of Stevie Ray Vaughan. \n\nIn January 1990, Vaughan gave a speech at an [[Alcoholics Anonymous|AA]] meeting; a recording and transcript of the speech have been widely circulated on the internet.{{sfn|Hopkins|2011|p=231}} On January 30, Vaughan made a guest appearance on ''[[MTV Unplugged]]'' in New York City, performing \"Rude Mood\", \"Pride and Joy\", and \"[[Testify (The Isley Brothers song)|Testify]]\".{{sfn|Hopkins|2011|p=236}} In March, Vaughan collaborated with his brother, Jimmie, to record ''[[Family Style]]'', produced by [http://www.nilerodgers.com Nile Rodgers]{{sfn|Hopkins|2011|p=238}} which was released on September 25, 1990.{{sfn|Hopkins|2011|p=271}} Containing ten songs, the album was a long-awaited project for both brothers; Jimmie said that the sessions \"seemed natural\" and \"almost like we were back home\".{{sfn|Hopkins|2011|p=239}} Vaughan said, \"We've probably gotten closer making this record than we have been since we were little kids at home, and I can honestly say I needed it.\"{{sfn|''Legends''|1997}}\n\nIn August 1990, Double Trouble opened for [[Eric Clapton]] during two concerts held at [[Alpine Valley Music Theatre]] in [[East Troy, Wisconsin]].<ref>[http://www.livenation.com/Alpine-Valley-Music-Theatre-tickets-East-Troy/venue/57500 Alpine Valley Music Theatre - Elkhorn | Tickets, Schedule, Seating Chart, Directions].

It was just like, 'this is a great coupla nights and wasn't it great to be here,' and talked about the record that he and Jimmie just made, how they had a lot of fun and that was exciting. He was looking forward to that coming out and looking forward to us making another record. He was in great spirits. I mean, we just had two great nights and we talked about all kinds of stuff, talked about the son that my wife and I were getting ready to have\u2013we didn't know it was a boy\u2013but just anything and everything. We talked for, I guess, almost 30 minutes.\n\n::Then he got up and said, 'I'm gonna go back down to the dressing room for a minute.' I don't know, maybe five minutes or so later, he came back up and he had his jacket on, he had his bags. He was making this turn, and I said, 'Hey, what are you doin'?' And he said, 'I'm gonna go back to Chicago.' I said 'Well, now?' And he said, 'Yeah, I gotta get back. I want to call Janna,' his girlfriend, in New York. I thought, 'Jeez, you could actually call her anywhere and then call her later,' but he turned around and said, 'Call me when you get back. I love you,' and kinda gave me that wink of the eye he would do. And then he was gone. He just disappeared into the night.{{sfn|''In the Studio''|1993}}\n\n==Death, autopsy, and burial==\n{{main|Death of Stevie Ray Vaughan}}\nOn August 27, 1990, Vaughan had just performed with Double Trouble at [[Alpine Valley Music Theatre]] in East Troy, Wisconsin. All of the musicians boarded four helicopters bound for Chicago, which were waiting on a nearby golf course. According to a witness, there was haze and fog with patches of low clouds. Despite the conditions, the pilots were instructed to fly over a 1000-foot ski hill. Vaughan, along with three members of [[Eric Clapton]]'s entourage (agent Bobby Brooks, bodyguard Nigel Browne, and assistant tour manager Colin Smythe), boarded the third of the four helicopters \u2014 a [[Bell 206|Bell 206B Jet Ranger]] \u2014 flying to [[Meigs Field]]. At about 12:50 am ([[Central Time Zone (North America)|CDT]]),{{sfn|Hopkins|2011|p=263}} the helicopter departed from an elevation of about 850 feet, veered to the left and crashed into the hill.  All on board, including the pilot, Jeff Brown, were killed instantly.{{sfn|Hopkins|2011|p=264}} In ''Clapton: The Autobiography'', Clapton explains that, contrary to rumors, his seat was not given to Vaughan but as indicated above, three members of Clapton's entourage were on board with Vaughan at the time of the crash.<ref>[http://www.artistfacts.com/detail.php?id=379 Stevie Ray Vaughan Artistfacts]. Artistfacts.com. Retrieved on 2012-09-16.</ref>\n\nAt 4:30 am, [[Civil Air Patrol]] was notified of the accident, eventually locating the crash site almost three hours later.{{sfn|Hopkins|2011|p=263}} Both Clapton and [[Jimmie Vaughan]] were asked to identify the bodies; a [[Coptic cross]] [[cross necklace|necklace]], worn by Vaughan, was given to Jimmie Vaughan. The [[Walworth County, Wisconsin|Walworth County]] coroner conducted an autopsy and found that Vaughan suffered from multiple internal and skull injuries.{{sfn|''The Daily Union''|1990}} The cause of death was officially stated as \"[[exsanguination]] due to transverse laceration of the [[aorta]]\".{{sfn|Hopkins|2011|p=264}} According to the ''[[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel]]'', a veteran pilot for Alpine Valley suspected that Brown attempted to fly around the ski hill, but misjudged the location.{{sfn|Held|1990}} Clapton issued a statement the next day, saying that the victims \"were my companions, my associates and my friends. This is a tragic loss of some very special people. I will miss all of them very much.\"{{sfn|Digiovanni|1990}}\n\nVaughan's memorial was held on August 30, 1990, at Laurel Land Cemetery in Dallas, where he was buried next to his father,{{sfn|Hopkins|2011|p=285}} and was preceded by a private chapel service for close friends and family. Reverend Barry Bailey of the [[United Methodist Church]] in Fort Worth, who was Vaughan's AA sponsor, opened the service with personal thoughts: \"We're here to thank God for this man's life. He was a genius, a superstar, a musician's musician. He captured the hearts of thousands and thousands of people. I am thankful for the impact of this man's influence on thousands of people in getting his own life together in the name of God.\" [[Kim Wilson]], [[Jeff Healey]], [[David Bowie]], [[Charlie Sexton]], [[ZZ Top]], [[Colin James]], and [[Buddy Guy]] attended the event. [[Stevie Wonder]], [[Jackson Browne]], and [[Bonnie Raitt]] sang \"[[Amazing Grace]]\" at the event.{{sfn|Hopkins|2011|p=266}} [[Nile Rodgers]] gave a eulogy,{{sfn|Milkowski|1990}} while a member of the Nightcrawlers read chapters five and eleven from ''[[The Big Book (Alcoholics Anonymous)|The Big Book]]'', the 'bible' of [[Alcoholics Anonymous]].{{sfn|Hopkins|2011|p=267}} In 1995, the Vaughan family received an undisclosed settlement for wrongful death.{{sfn|Hopkins|2011|p=292}}\n\n==Personal life==\nVaughan and Lenora \"Lenny\" Bailey met in 1973 after one of Vaughan's performances with the Nightcrawlers at La Cucaracha, a nightclub in east Austin.{{sfn|Hopkins|2010|p=79}}{{sfn|Hopkins|2010|p=129}} Although moved by Vaughan's musical prowess, she was attracted to his charmingly modest personality.{{sfn|Guitar Center|2007}} Double Trouble's song \"[[Love Struck Baby]]\", he said, was written about her, after claiming July 5 as their \"love struck day\".{{sfn|Patoski & Crawford|1993}} The couple was married on December 23, 1979, between sets at the Rome Inn in Austin, using pieces of wire for rings. Drummer, Chris Layton, described the ceremony as \"spontaneous\",{{sfn|''Legends''|1997}} saying, \"It wasn't like there was invitations sent out or a certain group of people attended\u2014it was just whoever was there was hanging around.\" Layton also said their marriage was \"pretty excitable and passionate\".{{sfn|Hopkins|2010|p=153}} The song \"[[Pride and Joy (Stevie Ray Vaughan song)|Pride and Joy]]\" is also about her, as well as the instrumental \"[[Lenny (instrumental)|Lenny]]\", after she thought \"Pride and Joy\" referred to a former girlfriend of Vaughan's.\n\nUpon return to their home in Austin from touring, Vaughan found the house padlocked, electricity shut off, and Lenny nowhere to be found. Biographers Joe Nick Patoski and Bill Crawford wrote that she \"squandered his road earnings on dope while running around with other men that one acquaintance glibly described as 'police characters.'\"{{sfn|Patoski & Crawford|1993}} After she declined to visit Vaughan in treatment for substance abuse, he filed for divorce three months later. The case was settled out of court, with Lenny receiving [[alimony]], plus $50,000 in cash and twenty-five percent of net royalties (excluding albums after ''Live Alive'').{{sfn|Hopkins|2011|p=189}} Vaughan's manager attributes the demise of their marriage to \"jealousy\" and \"unfaithfulness\", and as a result, they were both brokenhearted.{{sfn|Hopkins|2011|p=136}}\n\nOn March 12, 1986, Double Trouble arrived in New Zealand for a performance at the [[Wellington Town Hall]], where Vaughan was sitting outside his hotel room. Janna Lapidus, who was born in [[Russia]], ran into Vaughan on the street and immediately struck up a friendship. In October 1986, while Vaughan was in the [[London Clinic]] for substance abuse, Lapidus visited him;{{sfn|Hopkins|2011|p=147}} they both decided to be together after seeing an older couple in front of them during a walk in [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]].{{sfn|Hopkins|2011|p=148}}\n\nDuring Vaughan's last two years before his death, he referred to Lapidus as his fianc\u00e9e. They often made public appearances together including a commercial for [[Europa (oil company)|Europa]], a New Zealand-owned oil company.{{sfn|Hopkins|2011|p=182}} Janna also appeared in the video for 'The House is Rockin'. They first lived at Vaughan's childhood home in Dallas,{{sfn|Hopkins|2011|p=161}} then moved to a house on Travis Street on May 3, 1987.{{sfn|Hopkins|2011|p=168}} Lapidus found modeling work in New York City, and they relocated to a [[Manhattan]] apartment at [[Park Avenue]] and [[24th Street (Manhattan)|24th Street]] in May 1990, splitting their time between Dallas and New York City.{{sfn|Hopkins|2011|p=242}}\n\n==Musical style==\n\nVaughan's music took root in [[blues]], [[Rock music|rock]], and [[jazz]]. He was influenced by the work of artists such as [[Jimi Hendrix]], [[Albert King]], [[B.B. King]], [[Freddie King]], [[Albert Collins]], [[Johnny \"Guitar\" Watson]], [[Buddy Guy]], [[Howlin' Wolf]], [[Otis Rush]], [[Guitar Slim]], [[Chuck Berry]], and [[Muddy Waters]]. According to nightclub owner [[Clifford Antone]], who opened Antone's in 1975, Vaughan jammed with Albert King at Antone's in July 1977 and almost \"scared him to death\", saying that \"it was the best I've ever saw Albert or the best I ever saw Stevie\".{{sfn|Hopkins|2010|p=106}} He was also influenced by jazz guitarists like [[Django Reinhardt]], [[Wes Montgomery]], [[Kenny Burrell]], and [[George Benson]].{{sfn|Hopkins|2011|p=155}} While Albert King had a substantial influence on Vaughan, Jimi Hendrix was Vaughan's greatest inspiration. Vaughan declared: \"I love Hendrix for so many reasons. He was so much more than just a blues guitarist\u2013he played damn well any kind of guitar he wanted. In fact I'm not sure if he even played the guitar\u2013he played music.\"{{sfn|Joseph|1983}}\n\nVaughan owed his guitar technique in large part to Lonnie Mack, who Vaughan observed in live performance as \"ahead of his time\".{{sfn|Joseph|1983}} Mack later recalled his first meeting with Vaughan in 1978: \"We was in Texas looking for pickers, and we went out to see the Thunderbirds. Jimmie was saying, 'Man, you gotta hear my little brother. He plays all your [songs].' He was playing a little place called the Rome Inn, and we went over there and checked him out. As it would be, when I walked in the door, he was playing 'Wham!' And I said, 'Dadgum.' He was playing it right. I'd been playing it wrong for a long time and needed to go back and listen to my original record. That was in '78, I believe.\"{{sfn|Hopkins|2011|p=128}} Vaughan owed part of his enduring style\u2014especially his use of [[tremolo picking]] and vibrato\u2014to Mack. He acknowledged that Mack taught him to \"play guitar from the heart\".{{sfn|''Request''|1989}} Vaughan's relationship with another Texas blues legend, [[Johnny Winter]], was a little more complex. Although they met several times, and often played sessions with the same musicians or even performed the same material, as in the case of ''Boot Hill'', Vaughan always refrained from acknowledging Winter in any form. In his biography, \"Raisin' Cain\", Winter says that he was unnerved after reading Vaughan stating in an interview that he never met or knew Johnny Winter. \"We even played together over at Tommy Shannon's house one time.\" Vaughan settled the issue in 1988 on the occasion of a Blues Festival in Europe where both he and Winter were on the bill, explaining that he has been misquoted and that \"Every musician in Texas knows Johnny and has learned something from him\". {{sfn|Sullivan|2010}} Asked to compare their playing styles in an interview in 2010, Winter admitted that \"mine's a little bit rawer, I think.\" {{sfn|Musoscribe|2010}}\n\n==Equipment==\n\n===Guitars===\nVaughan owned and used a variety of guitars during his career. His guitar of choice, and the instrument that he became most associated with, was the [[Fender Stratocaster]], his favorite being a 1962 body, with a 1961 neck, and pickups dated from 1959. This is why Vaughan usually referred to his Stratocaster as a, \"1959 Strat.\" Vaughan also referred to this instrument as his \"first wife,\" or, \"Number One.\" Another favourite guitar, was a slightly later Strat he named 'Lenny' after his wife, Lenora. While at a local pawn shop in 1980, Vaughan had noticed this particular guitar, a 1965 stratocaster that had been refinished in red, with the original sunburst finish peeking through. It also had a 1910 Mandolin inlay just below the bridge. The pawn shop was asking $300 for it, which was way more than Vaughan had at the time. Lenny saw how badly he wanted this guitar, so she got six of their friends to chip in $50 each, and bought it for him. The guitar was presented to him on his birthday in 1980, and that night, after bringing \"Lenny\" (the guitar, and wife) home with him, he wrote the song, \"Lenny.\" He started using a borrowed Stratocaster during high school and used Stratocasters predominantly in his live performances and recordings, although he did play other guitars, including custom guitars built for him by James Hamilton of Hamiltone Guitars.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}\n\nVaughan bought many Stratocasters and gave some away as gifts.  A sunburst Diplomat Strat-style guitar was purchased by Vaughan and given to his girlfriend Janna Lapidus to learn to play on.{{sfn|Hopkins|2011|p=326}} Vaughan used heavy strings starting with .013's, tuned a half-step below [[standard tuning]]. He played with so much tension that it was not uncommon for him to separate his fingernail from the quick movement along the strings.  The owner of an Austin club recalled Vaughan coming into the office between sets to borrow some super glue, which he used to keep fingernail split from widening while he continued to play.  He preferred a guitar neck with an asymmetrical profile (thicker at the top) which was more comfortable for his thumb-over style of playing. Heavy use of the vibrato bar necessitated frequent replacements; Vaughan often had his roadie, Byron Barr, obtain custom stainless steel bars made by Barr's father.{{sfn|Hopkins|2011|p=323}} Vaughan was also photographed playing a [[National String Instrument Corporation|National Duolian]], [[Epiphone|Epiphone Riviera]], [[Gibson Flying V]], as well as several other models.{{sfn|Hopkins|2011|pp=325-326}} Vaughan used a [[Johnny Smith#Gibson Johnny Smith|Gibson Johnny Smith]] to record \"Stang's Swang\", and a [[Guild Guitar Company|Guild 12-string acoustic]] for his performance on ''[[MTV Unplugged]]'' in January 1990.{{sfn|Hopkins|2011|p=326}} On June 24, 2004, one of Vaughan's Stratocasters, the aforementioned \"Lenny\" strat, was sold at an auction to benefit [[Eric Clapton]]'s [[Crossroads Centre]] in [[Antigua]]; the instrument was bought by [[Guitar Center]] for $623,500.{{sfn|Hopkins|2011|p=324}}\n\n===Amplifiers and effects===\nVaughan was a catalyst in the revival of vintage amplifiers and effects during the 1980s. His loud volume and use of heavy strings required powerful and robust amplifiers. Vaughan used two black-face [[Fender Super Reverb]]s, which were crucial in shaping his clear overdriven sound. He would often blend other amps with the Super Reverbs, including black-face [[Fender Vibroverb]]s,{{sfn|Hopkins|2011|p=326}} and brands such as [[Dumble Amplifiers|Dumble]], and [[Marshall Amplification|Marshall]], which he used for his clean sound.{{sfn|Hopkins|2011|pp=326-327}} While his mainstay effects were the [[Ibanez Tube Screamer]] and a [[Vox (musical equipment)|Vox wah-wah pedal]],{{sfn|Hopkins|2011|p=327}} Vaughan experimented with a range of effects. He used a [[Fender Vibratone]],{{sfn|Hopkins|2011|p=326}} designed as a [[Leslie speaker]] for electric guitars, and provided a warbling chorus effect, which can be heard on the track \"Cold Shot\". He used a vintage [[Dallas Arbiter]] [[Fuzz Face]] that can be heard on ''[[In Step]]'', as well as an [[Octavia (effects pedal)|Octavia]].{{sfn|Hopkins|2011|p=327}}\n\n===Guitar rig and signal flow===\nA detailed gear diagram of Vaughan's 1985 \"Soul to Soul\" touring guitar rig is well-documented.<ref>Cooper, Adam (2000).
