He recorded solo and as part of the duo, the Shreveport Home Wreckers, and with a six/seven piece group, the Wampus Cats. Early in his career he backed [[Jimmie Davis]] on some of his recordings. Woods's best known song was \"Lone Wolf Blues\", from which came his billing as 'The Lone Wolf'.<ref name=\"AMG\"/>\n\n==Life and career==\nHe was born around [[Natchitoches, Louisiana]], [[United States]], with the birth year variously listed as somewhere between 1892 and 1900. He relocated to [[Shreveport, Louisiana]] around 1925, where he started to work as a street musician and played for tips at [[juke joint]]s.<ref name=\"AMG\"/>  Various sources claim that he learned the rudiments of playing a bottleneck slide guitar after watching an Hawaiian [[music ensemble]], who toured Louisiana in the early part of the 1920s.<ref name=\"Trail\">{{cite web |url=http://www.thebluestrail.com/artists/mus_obw.htm |title=Oscar \"Buddy\" Woods |author= |date= |work= |publisher=Thebluestrail.com |accessdate=November 23, 2011}}</ref> Woods teamed up with another guitar player, Ed Schaffer, and played billed as the Shreveport Home Wreckers at The Blue Goose Grocery and Market, which was a [[speakeasy]] in Shreveport.<ref>{{cite book\n| first= Eric J.\n| last= Brock\n| year= 2001\n| title= Eric Brock's Shreveport\n| edition= 1st\n| publisher= Pelican Publishing Company, Inc. \n| location= [[Gretna, Louisiana]], United States\n| isbn= 1-56554-870-1\n| page= 217}}</ref> In May 1930, the duo recorded for [[Victor Records]] in [[Memphis, Tennessee]].<ref name=\"AMG\"/>\n\nIn May 1932, the Shreveport Home Wreckers backed [[Jimmie Davis]] on four sides recorded in [[Dallas]], [[Texas]].  They also recorded another two tracks on their own, and the released [[Single (music)|single]] saw them billed as 'Eddie and Oscar'. The significance of this mixed-race recording session spilled over into a joint tour - a unique sociological situation at that time in the [[Southern United States|South]].<ref name=\"AMG\"/> \n\nWoods next recorded for [[Decca Records|Decca]] in March 1936 in [[New Orleans]].<ref name=\"AMG\"/> The tracks included Woods best known piece, \"Lone Wolf Blues,\" and his first take of the self-penned \"Don't Sell It, Don't Give It Away.\"<ref name=\"Trail\"/> The releases sold well, and by the time Woods recorded again in October 1937, the Shreveport Home Wreckers had swelled in numbers to become the Wampus Cats. They backed both Woods, and a female singer, Kitty Gray, on several tracks recorded in 1937 and the following year for [[Vocalion Records|Vocalion]].<ref name=\"AMG\"/>\n\nIn October 1940, Woods made his final five track recording for the [[Library of Congress]].<ref name=\"AMG\"/> Following the session, [[John Lomax]] wrote: \"Oscar (Buddy) Woods, Joe Harris and Kid West are all professional Negro guitarists and singers of Texas Avenue, Shreveport.. The songs I have recorded are among those they use to cajole nickels and dimes from the pockets of listeners.\"<ref name=\"Sunday\"/> Local records suggest that Woods continued to live in Shreveport, and after his recording career was over, he played again as a street musician and at dances.<ref name=\"AMG\"/>\n\nWoods died in Shreveport in December 1955.<ref name=\"AMG\"/>\n\n==Style and legacy==\nWoods played his guitar flat on his lap, in a similar manner to the Hawaiians, using a broken bottleneck slide technique. [[Lead Belly]] also used a slide technique, but held his guitar in the normal manner. It is suggested that the popularity of slide guitar playing in the [[Mississippi delta]] at that time, may have arisen from the appearance of Hawaiian musicians at the 1893 [[World's Columbian Exposition|Chicago World's Fair]].<ref name=\"Oliver\">{{cite book\n| first= Paul\n| last= Oliver\n| year= 1997\n| title= The Story of the Blues\n| edition= 2nd\n| publisher= [[Northeastern University Press]] \n| location= [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]], United States\n| isbn= 1-55553-355-8\n| page= 157}}</ref><ref name=\"Wolfe\">{{cite book\n| first= Charles K.\n| last= Wolfe\n| year= 1999\n| title= The life and legend of Leadbelly\n| edition= 2nd\n| publisher= Da Capo Press, Inc. \n| location= [[New York City|New York]], United States\n| isbn= 0-306-80896-X\n| page= 91}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Allmusic]] [[music journalism|music journalist]], Uncle Dave Lewis, noted of Woods, \"in the style of lap steel, bottleneck blues slide guitar; some experts believe he may have been the primary force behind the creation of this whole genre\".<ref name=\"AMG\"/>\n\nWoods guitar playing techiques were passed onto his prot\u00e9g\u00e9, [[Black Ace]], who was approximately fifteen years younger than Woods, and had played with Woods around Shreveport.<ref name=\"Sunday\">{{cite web |url=http://sundayblues.org/archives/tag/oscar-buddy-woods |title=Big Road Blues |author= |date= |work= |publisher=Sundayblues.org |accessdate=November 23, 2011}}</ref><ref name=\"Oliver\"/> The [[compilation album]] mentioned below, included both Woods and Black Ace tracks.<ref name=\"Wirz\"/>\n\nThe Shreveport Home Wreckers track, \"Flying Crow Blues\", was recorded in 1932.
