She is a member of the [[Tedeschi Trucks Band]] (originally known as \"Soul Stew Revival\"), which is a conglomeration of her band, [[Derek Trucks|her husband's]] [[The Derek Trucks Band]], and other musicians. \n\nTedeschi served as a judge for the 7th annual [[The Independent Music Awards|Independent Music Awards]] to support independent artists' careers.<ref>[http://www.independentmusicawards.com/ima_new/pastjudges.asp Independent Music Awards - Past Judges]</ref>\n\n==Early life==\n{{Expand section|date=January 2011}}\nSusan Tedeschi was born on November 9, 1970, in [[Boston, Massachusetts]], to a family of Italian ancestry (''Tedeschi'' means ''Germans'' in Italian) and was raised in [[Norwell, Massachusetts]]. She is the daughter of Dick Tedeschi, granddaughter of Nick Tedeschi and great-granddaughter of Angelo Tedeschi, founder of the [[Tedeschi Food Shops|New England-based supermarket and convenience store chain]].<ref name=\"foodstores\">{{cite web |url=http://www.tedeschifoodshops.com/Our_Story/Our_History/ |title=Our History |publisher=Tedeschi Food Stops |accessdate=October 14, 2013}}</ref> Tedeschi has always been musically inclined and made her debut public performance as a six-year old  [[understudy]] in a [[Broadway musical]]. Also, she sang for family members and listened to her father's record collection of old [[vinyl record]]ings, like [[Mississippi John Hurt]] and [[Lightning Hopkins]]. Raised as a [[Catholic]], she found little inspiration in the church choir and attended predominantly [[African-American]] Baptist churches, feeling the music was \"less repressed and more like a celebration of God.\" She has played in bands since the age of 13. At the age of 18 she formed her first all-original group The Smokin' Section in the nearby town of [[Scituate, Massachusetts]].<ref name=\"Lilith1\">[http://www.lilithfair.com/artists/susantedeschi/index.html Lilith Fair Biography]</ref>\n\nAfter graduating [[Norwell High School (Massachusetts)|Norwell High School]], Tedeschi attended the [[Berklee College of Music]] where she sang in a [[Gospel music|Gospel choir]]. She performed show tunes on the  ''Spirit of Boston'' and received her [[Bachelor of Music]] degree in [[musical composition]] and performance at age 20.<ref name=\"Tedeschi comes home\"/> During that time she began sitting in on blues jams at local venues and immersed herself in the Boston music scene.\n\n==Career==\n\n===Early career===\nTedeschi formed the '''Susan Tedeschi Band''' in 1993<ref name=\"Tedeschi comes home\"/> featuring [[Tom Hambridge]] and Adrienne Hayes. In 1995 her then boyfriend, Boston musician Tim Gearan taught Tedeschi how to play blues guitar. It was then she really began to hone her skills on the instrument. In December the band released ''[[Better Days (Susan Tedeschi album)|Better Days]]'' to regional audiences. Record contracts were difficult to keep together; however, recording sessions from 1997 were acquired by Richard Rosenblatt and the band was signed to [[Independent record label|indy label]] Tone-Cool Records and ''[[Just Won't Burn]]'', featuring young guitarist [[Sean Costello]], was released in February 1998 to very positive reviews, particularly from blues critics and publications. Susan was the first artist to play the very first [[Sunset Sessions]] in March 1998 at the [[Marriott Hotels & Resorts|Marriott]] in the [[US Virgin Islands]]. <ref>{{cite web|last=Sunset Sessions|title=Locations & Alumni|url=http://sunsetsessions.org/time-capsule/locations-and-line-ups-1998-present/|accessdate=July 2013}}</ref> \n\nIn 1999, Tedeschi played several dates in the all-woman traveling festival [[Lilith Fair]] organized by [[Sarah McLachlan]].<ref name=\"Lilith1\" /> Throughout 1998 and 1999 she toured extensively throughout the United States and drew larger crowds.\n\n[[Image:Susan Tedeschi and band at the Appel Farms Arts and Music Festival June 2012.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Susan Tedeschi and The [[Tedeschi Trucks Band]] at the [[Appel Farm Arts and Music Festival]], June 2012]]\n\n===Opening acts===\nEventually Tedeschi was opening for [[John Mellencamp]], [[B.B. King]], [[Buddy Guy]], [[The Allman Brothers Band]], [[Taj Mahal (musician)|Taj Mahal]] and [[Bob Dylan]]. In 2000, ''Just Won't Burn'' reached Gold record status for sales of 500,000 in the United States, rare for a blues production. She recorded two tracks with [[Double Trouble (band)|Double Trouble]] band members [[Chris Layton]] and [[Tommy Shannon]] for their album.\n\nShe opened for [[The Rolling Stones]] in 2003 and played in huge venues, gaining national exposure. Somewhat surprisingly, the gig wasn't financially lucrative. According to Tedeschi, \"They pay, but it's not great. I don't make any money 'cause I've got to pay all my [[sidemen]]. I'll be lucky if I break even.\"<ref>[http://www.jacksonville.com/tu-online/stories/021903/dsr_11783973.shtml Florida Times-Union: February 19, 2003-Jacksonville Grammy-nominee Susan Tedeschi is by Nick Marino]</ref>\n\nIn 2004, Tedeschi was featured on the [[PBS]] show ''[[Austin City Limits]]'', flanked by William Green, on [[Hammond organ]], Jason Crosby, playing [[Keyboard instrument|keyboards]], [[violin]], and vocals, [[bassist]] Ron Perry, and [[Jeff Sipe]], on [[Drum kit|drums]].

Her guitar playing is influenced by [[Buddy Guy]], [[Johnny \"Guitar\" Watson]], [[Stevie Ray Vaughan]], [[Freddie King]] and [[Doyle Bramhall II]]. On the album \"Just Won't Burn,\" she lists a multitude of inspirations from various genres.  This list includes Irma Thomas, Etta James, Bob Marley, Toots Hibbert, Aretha Franklin, Otis Rush, [[Ronnie Earl]], [[Otis Clay]], Ray Charles, Billie Holiday, Bob Dylan, Dennis Montgomery III, Orville Wright, Walter Beasley, Kenya Hathaway, and Mahalia Jackson.\n\n===Personal life===\nIn 2001, she married [[Allman Brothers Band]] slide guitarist [[Derek Trucks]], who is [[bandleader]] and [[lead guitarist]] of [[The Derek Trucks Band]]. Tedeschi and Trucks met in [[New Orleans]] when she was the opening act on the Allman Brothers Band's 1999 Summer Tour.  They have two children; Charles Khalil Trucks, born in March 2001, is named for saxophonist [[Charlie Parker]], guitarist [[Charlie Christian]], and author [[Khalil Gibran]]. Sophia Naima Trucks, born in 2004, takes her unusual middle name from the [[John Coltrane]] ballad, which was also the jazz legend's first wife's name.  They reside in [[Jacksonville, Florida]].<ref name=\"FTU\">[http://www.jacksonville.com/lifestyles/2008-12-24/derek_trucks_the_dude_never_loses_his_cool Florida Times-Union: December 23, 2008-Derek Trucks: The dude never loses his cool by Matt Soergel]</ref>\n\n===Soul Stew Revival===\n[[File:Derek and Susan at Mizner.jpg|thumb|right|230px|Soul Stew Revival at [[Mizner Park]] with Derek Trucks December 28, 2007]]Tedeschi, with her powerful vocals and Trucks on guitar complement one another, and have toured together frequently under the name \"Soul Stew Revival\". This includes the members of The Derek Trucks Band, the members of Susan Tedeschi's band, and other musicians who travelled with them, including Trucks' younger brother, drummer Duane Trucks. In 2008, they added a three-piece [[horn section]].\n\n===Tedeschi Trucks Band===\nIn 2010, both Susan Tedeschi and her husband Derek Trucks announced a hiatus for their solo bands, and formed a new group called [[Tedeschi Trucks Band]]. The group performed at a number of festivals including Eric Clapton's [[Crossroads Guitar Festival]], [[Fuji Rock Festival]] and others. Unlike their previous collaborative project - Derek Trucks & Susan Tedeschi's Soul Stew Revival - the Tedeschi Trucks Band focuses on writing and performing original material, and is the focus of both Trucks and Tedeschi for the foreseeable future.<ref name=\"Bryson\">{{cite web | url = http://www.allaboutjazz.com/php/article.php?id=36591&pg=3#4 | title = Susan Tedeschi: Dreams and Legends | accessdate=June 7, 2010 | last = Bryson | first = Alan | work =All About Jazz}}</ref>\n\n==Grammy Award nominations==\n*[[42nd Grammy Awards|2000]] [[Grammy Award|Grammy]] nomination for [[Grammy Award for Best New Artist|Best New Artist]]\n*[[45th Grammy Awards|2003]] [[Grammy Award|Grammy]] nomination for [[Grammy Award for Best Female Rock Vocal Performance|Best Female Rock Vocal Performance]]\n*[[46th Grammy Awards|2004]] [[Grammy Award|Grammy]] nomination for [[Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Blues Album|Best Contemporary Blues Album]] for ''[[Wait for Me (Susan Tedeschi album)|Wait For Me]]''\n*[[48th Grammy Awards|2006]] [[Grammy Award|Grammy]] nomination for [[Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Blues Album|Best Contemporary Blues Album]] for ''[[Hope and Desire]]''\n*[[52nd Grammy Awards|2010]] [[Grammy Award|Grammy]] nomination for [[Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Blues Album|Best Contemporary Blues Album]] for ''[[Back to the River]]''\n\n==Grammy Awards won==\n*Won [[Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Blues Album|Best Blues Album]] alongside her other 10 bandmates in the [[Tedeschi Trucks Band]] for ''[[Revelator (Tedeschi Trucks Band album)|Revelator]]''\n\n==Discography==\n*''[[Better Days (Susan Tedeschi album)|Better Days]]'' (Oarfin, 1995)\n*''[[Just Won't Burn]]'' (Tone Cool, 1998)\n*''[[Wait for Me (Susan Tedeschi album)|Wait for Me]]'' (Tone Cool, 2002)\n*''[[Live from Austin, TX (Susan Tedeschi album)|Live from Austin, TX]]'' (New West, 2004)\n*''[[The Best Of Susan Tedeschi Episode One]]'' (Tone Cool/Artemis, 2005)\n*''[[Hope and Desire]]'' (Verve, 2005)\n*''[[The Best Of Susan Tedeschi Episode Two]]'' (TIndieblue Music, 2007)\n*''[[Back to the River]]'' (Verve, 2008)\n*''[[Revelator (Tedeschi Trucks Band album)|Revelator]]'' (Masterworks, 2011)\n*''[[Everybody's Talkin' (Tedeschi Trucks Band album)|Everybody's Talkin']]'' (Masterworks, 2012)\n*''[[Made Up Mind]]'' (Masterworks, 2013)\n\n===Collaborations and Guest Appearances===\n*\"It Hurt So Bad\", Track 14, ''[[Live from the Mountain Music Lounge discography|On the Mountain 4]]'' (1998), compilation by [[Seattle]] radio station [[KHTP|KMTT]]\n*''Welcome to Little Milton'' (1999), [[Little Milton]]\n*\"You Need to be With Me\", Track 12, ''[[Live from the Mountain Music Lounge discography|On the Mountain 5]]'' (1999), compilation by [[Seattle]] radio station [[KHTP|KMTT]]\n*\"It Hurt So Bad\" ([[Tom Hambridge]]), Track 3, ''Live From The Archives 7'' (2000), compilation by [[Seattle]] radio station [[KHTP|KMTT]]\n*\"It Hurt So Bad\", Track 3, ''[[Farm Aid]] Vol. 1 LIVE -
