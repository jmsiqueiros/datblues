He and his band The Hoodoo Men opened for [[Stevie Ray Vaughan]] for several tour dates in the [[United States]]. According to legend, Vaughan himself suggested the stage name \"Colin James\", because when announced over arena P.A. systems, \"Munn\" sounded like \"Mud\". James also played guitar on [[Richard Marx]]'s song \"Thunder and Lightning\".\n\n===Rock and swing band careers===\nIn 1988, following his association with Vaughan, James released his self-titled debut album, which yielded several international hit singles, as did the followup ''Sudden Stop''. He presaged the mid-1990s swing music revival with his Colin James and the Little Big Band project, which released a successful first CD in 1993, followed by two others in 1998 and 2006, as well as a Christmas album in 2007.\n\nJames's worldwide popularity waned somewhat in the late 1990s, but he continued to release albums in rock, blues, and acoustic styles, in addition to his Little Big Band. In 2005, he gave a [[Royal Command Performance|command performance]] for [[Queen Elizabeth II]] during her visit to his home province of [[Saskatchewan]].\n\nJames' backing band frequently includes members of the Vancouver-based band [[Odds (band)|Odds]], and he has co-written songs with Odds singer-guitarist [[Craig Northey]]. In February 2005, James guest-starred in an episode of the television program ''[[Corner Gas]]'', a Canadian [[sitcom]] based in rural Saskatchewan.\n\nIn 2007, James' album ''[[Limelight (Colin James album)|Limelight]]'' received a Gold record for sales in Canada.  In January 2008, James received three [[Toronto Blues Society]] [[Maple Blues Awards]]: \"Entertainer of the Year\", \"Electric Act of the Year\" and \"Recording of the Year\" for ''[[Colin James & The Little Big Band 3]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.torontobluessociety.com/mba/07winners.htm |title=2007 Maple Blues Awards Winners |accessdate=2009-05-13}}</ref>\n\nIn 2009, James recorded an album, and amongst the collaborators were [[Tom Wilson (musician)|Tom Wilson]], once of [[Junkhouse]]. The album, ''Rooftops and Satellites'', was co-produced, engineered and mixed by [[Mike Fraser]], at the Warehouse studios in [[Vancouver]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.colinjames.com/ |title=ColinJames.com News |date=2009-04-01 |accessdate=2009-05-13}}</ref>\n\n==Discography==\n===Studio albums===\n* ''[[Colin James (album)|Colin James]]'' (1988)\n* ''[[Sudden Stop]]'' (1990)\n* ''[[Colin James and the Little Big Band]]'' (1993)\n* ''[[Bad Habits (Colin James album)|Bad Habits]]'' (1995)\n* ''[[National Steel (album)|National Steel]]'' (1997)\n* ''[[Colin James and the Little Big Band II]]'' (1998)\n* ''[[Fuse (Colin James album)|Fuse]]'' (2000)\n* ''[[Traveler (Colin James album)|Traveler]]'' (2003)\n* ''[[Limelight (Colin James album)|Limelight]]'' (2005)\n* ''[[Colin James & The Little Big Band 3]]'' (2006)\n* ''[[Colin James & The Little Big Band: Christmas]]'' (2007)\n* ''Rooftops and Satellites'' (2009)\n* ''Fifteen'' (2012) #23 CAN<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jam.canoe.ca/Music/Charts/ALBUMS.html |title=CANOE - JAM!
