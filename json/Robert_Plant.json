Best known as the lead vocalist and lyricist of the rock band [[Led Zeppelin]], he has also had a successful solo career. With a career spanning more than 40 years and possessing a powerful wide vocal range (particularly using his trademark high-pitched vocals), Plant is regarded as one of the greatest singers in the history of rock and roll, and has influenced contemporaries and later singers such as [[Freddie Mercury]], [[Axl Rose]] and [[Chris Cornell]].<ref name=ROLLS>[http://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/100-greatest-singers-of-all-time-19691231/robert-plant-19691231 100 Greatest Singers Of All Time: Robert Plant] ''[[Rolling Stone]]''.

Plant had various jobs while pursuing his music career, one of which was working for the major British construction company [[George Wimpey|Wimpey]] in Birmingham in 1967 laying tarmac on roads. He also worked at [[Woolworths Group|Woolworths]] in Halesowen town for a short period of time. He cut three obscure singles on [[Columbia Records|CBS Records]]<ref>''Hammer Of the Gods'', by Stephen Davis ISBN 1-57297-306-4 (p.48-49)</ref> and sang with a variety of bands, including The Crawling King Snakes, which brought him into contact with drummer [[John Bonham]]. They both went on to play in the [[Band of Joy]], merging blues with newer psychedelic trends.\n\n===Led Zeppelin (1968\u20131980)===\n\n====Early years====\n[[File:Robert-Plant.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Plant with Led Zeppelin]]\nIn 1968, the guitarist [[Jimmy Page]] was in search of a lead singer for his new band and met Plant after being turned down by his first choice, [[Terry Reid]], who referred him to a show at a teacher training college in [[Birmingham]]\u2014 where Plant was singing in a band named Hobstweedle.<ref name=RS2006>{{cite journal |last=Gilmore |first=Mikal |title=The Long Shadow of Led Zeppelin |work=Rolling Stone |issue=1006 |date=10 August 2006 |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/11027261/the_long_shadow_of_led_zeppelin/print |accessdate=9 December 2007 }}</ref> Page explained:\n\n{{Cquote|''When I auditioned him and heard him sing, I immediately thought there must be something wrong with him personality-wise or that he had to be impossible to work with, because I just could not understand why, after he told me he'd been singing for a few years already, he hadn't become a big name yet. So I had him down to my place for a little while, just to sort of check him out, and we got along great. No problems''.<ref name=Schulps>Dave Schulps, [http://www.iem.ac.ru/zeppelin/docs/interviews/page_77.trp Interview with Jimmy Page], ''[[Trouser Press]]'', October 1977.</ref>}}\n\nAccording to Plant:\n\n{{Cquote|''I was appearing at this college when Peter and Jimmy turned up and asked me if I'd like to join [[The Yardbirds]]. I knew The Yardbirds had done a lot of work in America&nbsp;\u2013 which to me meant audiences who would want to know what I might have to offer&nbsp;\u2013 so naturally I was very interested''.<ref name=d&c>Ian Fortnam, \"Dazed & confused\", ''[[Classic Rock Magazine]]: Classic Rock Presents Led Zeppelin'', 2008, p. 39.</ref>}}\n\n[[File:Zoso Robert Plant feather symbol.svg|thumb|left|upright|Derivative of Plant's feather [[Sigil (magic)|sigil]] used in the ''[[Led Zeppelin IV]]'' album]]\nPlant and Page immediately hit it off with a shared musical passion and began their writing collaboration with reworkings of earlier blues songs, although Plant would receive no songwriting credits on the band's first album, allegedly because he was still under contract to [[Sony Music Entertainment|CBS Records]] at the time.  Plant brought along [[John Bonham]] as drummer, and they were joined by [[John Paul Jones (musician)|John Paul Jones]], who had previously worked with Page as a studio musician. Jones called Page on the phone before they checked out Plant, and Page hired Jones immediately.\n\nInitially dubbed the \"New Yardbirds\" in 1968, the band soon came to be known as [[Led Zeppelin]]. The band's [[Eponym#Other eponyms|eponymous]] [[Led Zeppelin (album)|debut album]] hit the charts in 1969 and is widely credited as a catalyst for the [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] genre. Plant has commented that it is unfair for people to think of Zeppelin as heavy metal, as almost a third of their music was acoustic.<ref>''The History of Rock 'n' Roll: The '70s: Have a Nice Decade''</ref>\n\nIn 1975, Plant and his wife Maureen (now divorced) were seriously injured in a car crash in [[Rhodes, Greece]]. This significantly affected the production of Led Zeppelin's seventh album ''[[Presence (album)|Presence]]'' for a few months while he recovered, and forced the band to cancel the remaining tour dates for the year.\n\nIn July 1977 his son Karac died at age five of a stomach infection while Plant was engaged on Led Zeppelin's [[Led Zeppelin North American Tour 1977|concert tour of the United States]]. It was a devastating loss for the family. Plant retreated to his home in the Midlands and for months afterward he questioned his future.<ref name=\"CelebrationII\">Dave Lewis (2003), ''Led Zeppelin: Celebration II: The 'Tight But Loose' Files'', London: Omnibus Press. ISBN 1-84449-056-4, p. 54.</ref> Karac's death later inspired him to write the song \"[[All My Love (Led_Zeppelin_song)|All My Love]]\" in tribute, featured on Led Zeppelin's final studio [[Gramophone record|LP]], 1979's ''[[In Through the Out Door]]''.\n\n====Lyrics====\n{{BLP sources section|date=June 2008}}\n{{Weasel|section|date=March 2009}}\nPlant did not begin writing song lyrics with Led Zeppelin until the making of ''[[Led Zeppelin II]]'', in 1969.  According to Jimmy Page:\n\n{{Cquote|''The most important thing about [[Led Zeppelin II]] is that up to that point I'd contributed lyrics.  Robert hadn't written before, and it took a lot of ribbing to get him into writing, which was funny. And then, on the second LP, he wrote the words of Thank You. He said, \"I'd like to have a crack at this and write it for my wife''.<ref>Kent, Nick.  \"Led Zeppelin: Eyewitness.\"  Mojo Magazine: Classic Rock Special Issue (2009, Volume 2, 1ssue 6), p. 104.</ref>}}\n\n[[File:Led Zeppelin acoustic 1973.jpg|thumb|340px|Plant and Page performing an acoustic set in 1973]]\nPlant's lyrics with Led Zeppelin were often mystical, philosophical and spiritual, alluding to events in classical and [[Norse mythology]], such as \"[[Immigrant Song]]\", which refers to [[Valhalla]] and [[Viking]] conquests. However, the song \"[[No Quarter (song)|No Quarter]]\" is often misunderstood to refer to the god [[Thor]]; the song actually refers to [[Mount Thor]] (which is named after the god). Another example is \"[[The Rain Song]]\".\n\nPlant was also influenced by [[J. R. R. Tolkien]],<ref>Robert Plant himself, in ''[[Vox (magazine)|Vox]]'', May 1993, page 18, stated, \"The self-indulgence, the silly over-the-top Tolkien-esque stuff... [[John Bonham|John]] made it everlasting.\".</ref><ref>Helen Armstrong (1993), 'The Singer, not the Song', in ''Amon Hen'' (the bulletin of [[The Tolkien Society]], U.K.), no. 123 p..4-5.</ref> whose book series inspired lyrics in some early Led Zeppelin songs.  Most notably \"[[The Battle of Evermore]]\", \"[[Misty Mountain Hop]]\",\"[[No Quarter (song)|No Quarter]]\", \"[[Ramble On]]\" and \"[[Over the Hills and Far Away (Led Zeppelin song)|Over the Hills and Far Away]]\" contain verses referencing Tolkien's ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' and ''[[The Hobbit]]''. Conversely, Plant sometimes used more straightforward blues-based lyrics dealing primarily with sexual innuendo, as in \"[[The Lemon Song]]\", \"[[Trampled Under Foot]]\", and \"[[Black Dog (song)|Black Dog]]\".\n\n[[Welsh mythology]] also forms a basis of Plant's interest in mystical lyrics. He grew up close to the Welsh border and would often take summer trips to [[Snowdonia]]. Plant bought a Welsh sheep farm in 1973, and began taking Welsh lessons and looking into the mythology of the land (such as [[Black Book of Carmarthen]], [[Book of Taliesin]], etc.) Plant's first son, Karac, was named after the Welsh warrior [[Caratacus]]. The song \"[[Bron-Y-Aur Stomp]]\" is named after the 18th Century Welsh cottage [[Bron-Yr-Aur]] owned by a friend of his father; it later inspired the song \"[[Bron-Yr-Aur (instrumental)|Bron-Yr-Aur]]\". The songs \"Misty Mountain Hop\", \"[[That's the Way (Led Zeppelin song)|That's the Way]]\", and early dabblings in what would become \"[[Stairway to Heaven]]\" were written in Wales and lyrically reflect Plant's mystical view of the land. Critic Steve Turner suggests that Plant's early and continued experiences in Wales served as the foundation for his broader interest in the mythologies he revisits in his lyrics (including those myth systems of Tolkien and the Norse).<ref>\"Stairway to Heaven, Paved with Gold: Led Zeppelin\u2019s Snowdonia.\" ''The Independent'', 6 April 1991.</ref>\n\nPage's passion for diverse musical experiences influenced Plant to explore Africa, specifically [[Marrakesh]] in Morocco where he encountered [[Umm Kulthum]].\n\n{{Cquote|''I was intrigued by the scales, initially, and obviously the vocal work. The way she sang, the way she could hold a note, you could feel the tension, you could tell that everybody, the whole orchestra, would hold a note until she wanted to change''.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/robert-plant-i-feel-so-far-away-from-heavy-rock-2063017.html |title=Robert Plant: 'I feel so far away from heavy rock'|work=The Independent |location=UK|accessdate=30 August 2010|date= 27 August 2010|author= Andy Gill}}</ref>}}\n\nThat musical inspiration eventually culminated in \"[[Kashmir (song)|Kashmir]]\". Both he and Jimmy Page revisited these influences during their reunion album ''[[No Quarter: Jimmy Page and Robert Plant Unledded]]'' in 1994. In his solo career, Plant again tapped from these influences many times, most notably in the 2002 album, ''[[Dreamland (Robert Plant album)|Dreamland]]''.\n\nArguably one of Plant's most significant achievements with Led Zeppelin was his contribution to the track \"[[Stairway to Heaven]]\", an epic rock [[ballad]] featured on ''[[Led Zeppelin IV]]'' that drew influence from [[folk music|folk]], [[blues]], [[Celtic music|Celtic traditional music]] and [[hard rock]] among other genres. Most of the lyrics of the song were written spontaneously by Plant in 1970 at [[Headley Grange]]. While never released as a single, the song has topped charts as the greatest song of all time on various polls around the world.{{citation needed|reason=Big claims like these need citations|date=September 2013}}\n\nPlant is also recognised for his lyrical improvisation in [[Led Zeppelin concerts|Led Zeppelin's live performances]], often singing verses previously unheard on studio recordings. One of the most famous Led Zeppelin musical devices involves Plant's vocal mimicking of band mate Jimmy Page's guitar effects. This can be heard in the songs \"[[How Many More Times]]\", \"[[Dazed and Confused (song)|Dazed and Confused]]\", \"[[The Lemon Song]]\", \"[[You Shook Me]]\", \"[[Nobody's Fault but Mine]]\" and \"[[Sick Again]]\".\n\nHe is also known for his light-hearted, humorous, and unusual on-stage banter, often referred to as \"plantations\".{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}  Plant often discusses the origin and background of the songs during his shows, and sometimes provides social comment as well.  He frequently talks about American blues musicians as his inspiration, mentioning artists like [[Robert Johnson (musician)|Robert Johnson]], [[Howlin' Wolf]], [[Blind Willie Johnson]], and [[Willie Dixon]] at the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] induction ceremony and the 2007 [[Ahmet Erteg\u00fcn Tribute Concert]] with Led Zeppelin.\n\n====Stage persona====\n[[File:Jimmy Page with Robert Plant 2 - Led Zeppelin - 1977.jpg|thumb|Plant (left) with Led Zeppelin guitarist [[Jimmy Page]] performing live]]\nPlant enjoyed great success with Led Zeppelin throughout the 1970s and developed a compelling image as the [[charisma]]tic rock-and-roll front man, similar to his contemporaries, [[The Who]] singer [[Roger Daltrey]], [[Mick Jagger]] of the [[Rolling Stones]] and [[Jim Morrison]] of [[The Doors]].<ref name=theirtime>\"Their Time is Gonna Come\", ''[[Classic Rock Magazine]]: Classic Rock Presents Led Zeppelin'', 2008.</ref> With his mane of long blond hair and powerful, bare-chested appearance, Plant helped to create the \"god of rock and roll\" or \"rock god\" archetype. On stage, Plant was particularly active in live performances, often dancing, jumping, skipping, snapping his fingers, clapping, making emphatic gestures to emphasise a lyric or cymbal crash, throwing back his head, or placing his hands on his hips. As the 1970s progressed he, along with the other members of Led Zeppelin, became increasingly flamboyant on-stage, and wore more elaborate, colourful clothing and jewellery.\n\nAccording to ''[[Classic Rock (magazine)|Classic Rock]]'' magazine, \"once he had a couple of US tours under his belt, 'Percy' Plant swiftly developed a staggering degree of bravado and swagger that irrefutably enhanced Led Zeppelin's rapidly burgeoning appeal.\"<ref name=d&c>Ian Fortnam, \"Dazed & confused\", ''[[Classic Rock Magazine]]: Classic Rock Presents Led Zeppelin'', 2008, p. 43.</ref> In 1994, during his \"Unledded\" tour with Jimmy Page, Plant himself reflected tongue-in-cheek upon his Led Zeppelin showmanship:\n\n{{Cquote|''I can't take my whole persona as a singer back then very seriously. It's not some great work of beauty and love to be a [[rock-and-roll]] singer.  So I got a few moves from [[Elvis Presley|Elvis]] and one or two from [[Sonny Boy Williamson II]] and [[Howlin' Wolf]] and threw them all together''.<ref>{{cite news |last=Strauss |first=Neil |title=Getting the Led Out of Led Zeppelin |newspaper=New York Times |date=30 October 1994 |page=H30 |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/30/arts/pop-music-getting-the-led-out-of-led-zeppelin.html }}</ref>}}\n\nOne of the oddest awards he received was the Rock Scene Magazine \"Chest O Rama\".  Readers of the magazine had to decide who had the best chest in rock and Plant was the winner.  When they contacted him about it, he replied:  \"I'm really greatly honoured although it's hard for me to be eloquent on the subject of my chest.\"<ref>Rock Scene magazine, June 1974, Four Seasons Publications, Inc. 59287-4</ref>\n\n===Solo career (1982\u2013present)===\n\n====Early career and success (1982\u20131993)====\nAfter the break-up of Led Zeppelin in December 1980 (following the death of [[John Bonham]]), Plant briefly considered abandoning music to pursue a career as a teacher in the [[Rudolf Steiner#Education|Rudolf Steiner education system]]; going so far as to be accepted for teacher-training. He nevertheless embarked on a successful solo career beginning with ''[[Pictures at Eleven]]'' in 1982, followed by 1983's ''[[The Principle of Moments]]''. Popular tracks from this period include \"[[Big Log]]\" (a Top 20 hit in 1983), \"[[In the Mood (Robert Plant song)|In the Mood]]\" (1983), \"[[Little by Little (Robert Plant song)|Little by Little]]\" (from 1985's ''[[Shaken 'n' Stirred]]''), \"Far Post\" (originally only on the B-side of \"[[Burning Down One Side]]\" but popularised by airplay on [[album-oriented rock]] stations), \"[[Tall Cool One (song)|Tall Cool One]]\" (a No. 25 hit off 1988's ''[[Now and Zen]]'') and \"[[I Believe (Robert Plant song)|I Believe]]\" (from 1993's ''[[Fate of Nations]]''), another song written for and dedicated to his late son, Karac. In 1984, Plant formed a short-lived all-star group with Jimmy Page and [[Jeff Beck]] called [[The Honeydrippers]], who had a No. 3 hit with a remake of the [[Phil Phillips]]' tune, \"[[Sea of Love (song)|Sea of Love]]\" and a follow-up hit with a cover of [[Roy Brown (blues musician)|Roy Brown]]'s \"[[Rockin' at Midnight]]\".  Although Plant avoided performing Led Zeppelin songs through much of this period (he occasionally would improvise his unique Zeppelin screams into his set), his tours in 1983 (with drummer [[Phil Collins]]) and 1985 were very successful, often performing to sold-out arena-sized venues.\n\nThrough the 1980s and 1990s, Plant co-wrote three solo albums with keyboardist/songwriter [[Phil Johnstone]]. ''Now and Zen'', ''[[Manic Nirvana]]'', and ''Fate of Nations'' (featuring [[Moya Brennan]] of [[Clannad (musical group)|Clannad]]). It was Johnstone who talked Plant into playing Led Zeppelin songs in his live shows, something Plant had resisted, not wanting to be forever known as \"the former Led Zeppelin vocalist\".\n\nAlthough Led Zeppelin split in 1980, Plant and Page occasionally collaborated on various projects, including ''[[The Honeydrippers: Volume One]]'' album in 1984.  In the spring 2 years later Robert performed at the [[Birmingham Heart Beat Charity Concert 1986]].  The pair again worked together in the studio on the 1988 Page solo effort, ''[[Outrider (album)|Outrider]]'', and in the same year Page contributed to Plant's album ''Now and Zen''. Also, on 15 May 1988 Plant appeared with Page as a member of Led Zeppelin (and in his own right as a solo artist) at the [[Atlantic Records 40th Anniversary]] concert.\"Plant also took the stage with Queen at Wembley Stadium for 1992's \"The Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert\" for AIDS Awareness. Plant sang Queen's \"[[Innuendo]]\", Led Zeppelin's \"[[Kashmir]]\", Led Zeppelin's \"[[Thank You (Led Zeppelin song)|Thank You]]\", and Queen's \"[[Crazy Little Thing Called Love]]\".\n\n====Page and Plant (1994\u20131998)====\n[[Page and Plant]] became a full-fledged performing act from 1994 through 1998, releasing the ''[[Unledded]]'' album in 1994 and following with an enormously successful tour in 1995. Fourteen years of speculation from their fans and occasional sniping between the two former members ended when they reconvened their former musical partnership to produce ''No Quarter''. Having long resisted offers from MTV to reform to do an ''Unplugged'' show, they finally accepted as part of a deal that also allowed them to visit Morocco to record new material. The album combines the results of both of these projects. The Led Zeppelin material features new arrangements and new instrumentation, including strings, Egyptian musicians and the vocals of British-Asian star Najma Akhtar.\nPage and Plant recorded their only post-Zeppelin album of original material on the 1998 album ''[[Walking into Clarksdale]]'', an effort that was unsuccessful commercially, leading Plant to return to his solo career.  A song from this album, \"[[Please Read the Letter]]\", was re-recorded by Plant with [[Alison Krauss]], winning the 2009 [[Grammy Award for Record of the Year]].\n\n====Priory of Brion (1999\u20132000)====\nStarting in mid-1999, Plant performed until the end of 2000 at several small venues with his folk-rock band, named Priory of Brion.\n\nIn 1999, Plant contributed to the [[tribute album]] for [[Moby Grape]] co-founder [[Skip Spence]], who was terminally ill.  The album, ''[[More Oar: A Tribute to the Skip Spence Album]]'' ([[Birdman Records|Birdman]], 1999), with the album title referring to Spence's only solo album, ''[[Oar (Skip Spence album)|Oar]]'' ([[Columbia Records|Columbia]], 1969), contained Plant's version of Spence's \"Little Hands\".  Plant had been an admirer of Spence and Moby Grape since the release of Moby Grape's [[eponymous]] 1967 [[Moby Grape (album)|debut album]].<ref>Plant included \"8:05\", from the first Moby Grape album, as a B-side to a 1993 single; it is also included on the expanded reissue of his ''[[Fate of Nations]]'' album on [[Rhino Records]]. Plant performed \"Hey Grandma\" (also from the first Moby Grape album) live when with his pre-Led Zeppelin [[Band of Joy]], during the 1967\u20131968 period.

On the ''[[Sixty Six to Timbuktu]]'' collection (2003), Plant includes his version of Spence's \"Little Hands\", as well as \"Naked If I Want To\", another song from the first Moby Grape album.</ref>\n\nIn 2001, Plant appeared on [[Afro Celt Sound System]]'s album ''[[Volume 3: Further in Time]]''. The song \"Life Begin Again\" features a duet with Welsh folksinger [[Julie Murphy]], emphasising Plant's recurring interest in Welsh culture (Murphy would also tour in support of Plant).\n\n====Strange Sensation (2001\u20132007)====\nIn 2002, with his then newly formed band [[Strange Sensation]], Plant released a widely acclaimed collection of mostly blues and folk remakes, ''[[Dreamland (Robert Plant album)|Dreamland]]''. Contrasting with this lush collection of often relatively obscure remakes, the second album with Strange Sensation, ''[[Mighty ReArranger]]'' (2005), contains new, original songs. Both have received some of the most favourable reviews of Plant's solo career and four [[Grammy]] nominations, two in 2003 and two in 2006.\n[[File:Robert Plant.jpg|thumb|left|Plant and Strange Sensation at the Green Man Festival, 2007.]]\nAs a former member of Led Zeppelin, along with Page and John Paul Jones, Plant received the [[Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award]] in 2005 and the [http://www.polarmusicprize.se/ Polar Music Prize] in 2006.\n\nFrom 2001 to 2007, Plant actively toured the US and Europe with Strange Sensation.

At the 1988 reunion, [[Jason Bonham]], the son of Led Zeppelin's late drummer [[John Bonham]], played drums.  Both sets featured only a few songs, performed with minimal rehearsal.  Plant was unhappy with both performances, saying that \"it was like sleeping with your ex-wife but not making love.\" At the 1990 [[Silver Clef Award]] Winners Concert at [[Knebworth Festival|Knebworth]], Plant was joined by Jimmy Page. Some of their set was released on the subsequent live album and video. In 1995, Led Zeppelin were inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]], and Plant performed at the induction show with Jimmy Page, John Paul Jones, [[Jason Bonham]], [[Neil Young]], [[Steven Tyler]] and [[Joe Perry (musician)|Joe Perry]], performing spirited versions of \"Bring It On Home\", \"Honeybee\", and \"When the Levee Breaks\".\n\nAfter years of reunion rumours, Led Zeppelin performed a full two-hour set on 10 December 2007 at the [[Ahmet Erteg\u00fcn Tribute Concert]], with [[Jason Bonham|Jason]] again filling in on drums.
