DO NOT change \"WERE\" to \"WAS\". --> an English [[Rock music|rock]] band formed in London in 1968. The band consisted of guitarist [[Jimmy Page]], singer [[Robert Plant]], bassist and keyboardist [[John Paul Jones (musician)|John Paul Jones]], and drummer [[John Bonham]]. The group's heavy, guitar-driven sound, rooted in [[blues]] on their early albums, has drawn them recognition as one of the progenitors of [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]], though their unique style drew from a wide variety of influences, including [[folk music]].\n\nAfter changing their name from the New [[The Yardbirds|Yardbirds]], Led Zeppelin signed a deal with [[Atlantic Records]] that afforded them considerable artistic freedom. Although the group was initially unpopular with critics, they achieved significant commercial success with albums such as ''[[Led Zeppelin (album)|Led Zeppelin]]'' (1969), ''[[Led Zeppelin II]]'' (1969), ''[[Led Zeppelin III]]'' (1970), their [[Led Zeppelin IV|untitled fourth album]] (1971), ''[[Houses of the Holy]]'' (1973), and ''[[Physical Graffiti]]'' (1975). Their fourth album, which features the track \"[[Stairway to Heaven]]\", is among the most popular and influential works in rock music, and it helped to cement the popularity of the group.\n\nPage wrote most of the music in Led Zeppelin's early career, while Plant generally supplied the songs' lyrics. Jones' keyboard-based compositions later became central to the group's music, and their later albums featured greater experimentation. The latter half of the band's career saw a series of [[Led Zeppelin concerts|record-breaking tours]] that earned them a reputation for excess and debauchery. Although they remained commercially and critically successful, their output and touring schedule were limited in the late 1970s, and the group disbanded following Bonham's death from alcohol-related asphyxia in 1980. In the decades since, the surviving members have sporadically collaborated and participated in one-off Led Zeppelin reunions. The most successful of these was at the 2007 [[Ahmet Ertegun Tribute Concert]] in London, with [[Jason Bonham]] taking his late father's place behind the drums.\n\nLed Zeppelin are widely considered one of the most successful, innovative and influential rock groups in history. They are one of the [[list of best-selling music artists|best-selling music artists]] in the history of audio recording; various sources estimate the group's record sales at 200 to 300&nbsp;million units worldwide. With 111.5&nbsp;million [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]]-certified units, they are the [[List of best-selling music artists in the United States|second-best-selling band in the United States]]<!--BAND - NOT ACT-->.{{sfn|Yahoo Chart Watch|2012}} Each of their nine studio albums placed on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'']] Top 10 and six reached the number-one spot.{{Sfn|Allmusic|2010}} ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine described them as \"the heaviest band of all time\",{{sfn|Rolling Stone|2006}} \"the biggest band of the '70s\"{{sfn|Rolling Stone|2011a}} and \"unquestionably one of the most enduring bands in rock history\".{{sfn|Rolling Stone|2009}} They were inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 1995; the museum's biography of the band states that they were \"as influential in that decade [the 1970s] as [[the Beatles]] were in the prior one\".{{sfn|Rock and Roll Hall of Fame|2010}}\n\n==History==\n\n===Formation===\n[[File:Led Zeppelin logo.svg|thumb|left|The band's logotype, used since 1973|alt=The name Led Zeppelin in irregular capitals in black and white]]\n\nIn 1966, London-based session guitarist [[Jimmy Page]] joined the blues-influenced rock band [[The Yardbirds]] to replace bassist [[Paul Samwell-Smith]]. Page soon switched from bass to lead guitar, creating a dual lead guitar line-up with [[Jeff Beck]]. Following Beck's departure in October 1966, the Yardbirds, tired from constant touring and recording, began to wind down.{{sfn|Yorke|1993|pp=56\u201359}} Page wanted to form a [[supergroup (music)|supergroup]] with him and Beck on guitars, and [[the Who]]'s [[Keith Moon]] and [[John Entwistle]] on drums and bass.{{sfn|Wall|2008|pp=15\u201316}} Vocalists [[Steve Winwood]] and [[Steve Marriott]] were also considered for the project.{{sfn|Wall|2008|pp=13\u201315}} The group never formed, although Page, Beck and Moon did record a song together in 1966, \"[[Beck's Bolero]]\", in a session that also included bassist-keyboardist [[John Paul Jones (musician)|John Paul Jones]].{{sfn|Davis|1985|pp=28\u201329}}\n\nThe Yardbirds played their final gig in July 1968 at [[University of Bedfordshire|Luton College of Technology]] in Bedfordshire.{{sfn|Buckley|2003|p=1198}} They were still committed to several concerts in Scandinavia, so drummer [[Jim McCarty]] and vocalist [[Keith Relf]] authorised Page and bassist [[Chris Dreja]] to use \"the Yardbirds\" name to fulfill the band's obligations. Page and Dreja began putting a new line-up together. Page's first choice for the lead singer was [[Terry Reid]], but Reid declined the offer and suggested [[Robert Plant]], a singer for the [[Band of Joy]] and Hobbstweedle.{{sfn|Yorke|1993|p=65}} Plant eventually accepted the position, recommending former Band of Joy drummer [[John Bonham]].{{sfn|Erlewine|2011a}} Jones inquired about the vacant position at the suggestion of his wife after Dreja dropped out of the project to become a photographer.{{sfn|Wall|2008|p=10}} He would later take the photograph that appeared on the back of Led Zeppelin's debut album.{{sfn|Fyfe|2003|p=45}} Page had known Jones since they were both session musicians and agreed to let him join as the final member.{{sfn|Yorke|1993|p=64}}\n\n[[File:Hindenburg burning.jpg|thumb|A 1937 photograph of the burning [[LZ 129 Hindenburg]], similar to that used on the cover of the band's debut album and extensively on later merchandise|alt=A black and white photograph of an airship near a mooring mast exploding at its stern.]]\nThe four played together for the first time in a room below a record store on Gerrard Street in London.{{sfn|Lewis|1994|p=3}} Page suggested that they attempt \"[[Train Kept A-Rollin']]\", originally a [[jump blues]] song popularised in a [[rockabilly]] version by [[Johnny Burnette]], which had been covered by the Yardbirds. \"As soon as I heard John Bonham play\", Jones recalled, \"I knew this was going to be great&nbsp;... We locked together as a team immediately\".{{sfn|Welch & Nicholls|2001|p=75}} Before leaving for Scandinavia, the group took part in a recording session for the [[P.J. Proby]] album, ''[[Three Week Hero]]''. The album's track \"Jim's Blues\", with Plant on harmonica, was the first studio track to feature all four future members of Led Zeppelin.{{sfn|Wall|2008|p=54}}\n\nThe band completed the [[Led Zeppelin Scandinavian Tour 1968|Scandinavian tour]] as the New Yardbirds, playing together for the first time in front of a live audience at Gladsaxe Teen Clubs in [[Gladsaxe Municipality|Gladsaxe]], Denmark, on 7 September 1968.{{sfn|Wall|2008|p=54}} Later that month, they began recording their first album, which was based on their live set. The album was recorded and mixed in nine days, and Page himself covered the costs.{{sfn|Wall|2008|pp=51\u201352}} After the album's completion, the band were forced to change their name after Dreja issued a [[cease and desist]] letter, stating that Page was only allowed to use the New Yardbirds moniker for the Scandinavian dates.{{sfn|Wall|2008|pp=72\u201373}} One account of how the new band's name was chosen held that Moon and Entwistle had suggested that a supergroup with Page and Beck would go down like a \"lead balloon\", an idiom for disastrous results.{{sfn|Shadwick|2005|p=36}} The group dropped the 'a' in ''lead'' at the suggestion of their manager, [[Peter Grant (music manager)|Peter Grant]], so that those unfamiliar with the term would not pronounce it \"leed\".{{sfn|Davis|1985|p=57}} The word \"balloon\" was swapped for \"[[zeppelin]]\", a word which, according to music journalist Keith Shadwick, brought \"the perfect combination of heavy and light, combustibility and grace\" to Page's mind.{{sfn|Shadwick|2005|p=36}}\n\nGrant secured a $143,000 advance contract from [[Atlantic Records]] in November 1968, which was then the biggest deal of its kind for a new band.{{sfn|Wall|2008|p=84}} Atlantic were a label with a catalogue of mainly blues, soul and jazz artists, but in the late 1960s they began to take an interest in British [[progressive rock]] acts. Record executives signed Led Zeppelin without having ever seen them.{{sfn|Fortnam|2008|p=43}} Under the terms of their contract, the band had autonomy in deciding when they would release albums and tour, and had the final say over the contents and design of each album. They would also decide how to promote each release and which tracks to release as singles. They formed their own company, Superhype, to handle all publishing rights.{{sfn|Lewis|1994|p=3}}\n\n===Early years: 1968\u201370===\nThe band began their first tour of the UK on 4 October 1968, still billed as the New Yardbirds, and played their first show as Led Zeppelin at the [[University of Surrey]] in [[Battersea]] on 25 October.{{sfn|Wall|2008|pp=73\u201374}} Tour manager [[Richard Cole]], who would become a major figure in the touring life of the group, organised their [[Led Zeppelin North American Tour 1968\u20131969|first North American tour]] at the end of the year.{{Sfn|Wall|2008|p=94}} The first show was in Denver on 26 December 1968, followed by other West Coast dates before the band travelled to California to play Los Angeles and San Francisco.{{sfn|Wall|2008||pp=92\u201393}} Their debut album, ''[[Led Zeppelin (album)|Led Zeppelin]]'', was released in the US during the tour on 12 January 1969, and peaked at number 10 on the ''Billboard'' chart;{{sfn|Allmusic|2010}} it was released in the UK, where it peaked at number 6, on 31 March.{{sfn|Wall|2008|pp=92, 147, 152}} According to [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine|Steve Erlewine]], the album's memorable guitar riffs, lumbering rhythms, [[Psychedelic rock|psychedelic blues]], groovy, [[Swing (jazz performance style)|bluesy shuffles]] and hints of [[Folk music of England|English folk]], made it \"a significant turning point in the evolution of hard rock and heavy metal\".{{sfn|Erlewine|2011b}}\n\n[[File:Bron-y-aur - geograph.org.uk - 21107.jpg|thumb|left|[[Bron-Yr-Aur]], the Welsh cottage to which Page and Plant retired in 1970 to write many of the tracks that appeared on the band's third and fourth albums|alt=A colour photograph of a stone cottage on a hill]]\nIn their first year, Led Zeppelin completed four US and four UK [[Concert#Concert tour|concert tour]]s, and also released their second album, ''[[Led Zeppelin II]]''. Recorded almost entirely on the road at various North American studios, it was an even greater commercial success than their first album, and reached the number one chart position in the US and the UK.{{sfn|Wall|2008|p=161}} The album further developed the mostly blues-rock musical style established on their debut release, creating a work with a sound that was \"heavy and hard, brutal and direct\", and which would be highly influential and frequently imitated.{{sfn|Erlewine|2010}} Steve Waksman has suggested that ''Led Zeppelin II'' was \"the musical starting point for heavy metal\".{{sfn|Waksman|2001|p=263}}\n\nThe band saw their albums as indivisible, complete listening experiences, disliking the re-editing of existing tracks for release as singles. Grant maintained an aggressive pro-album stance, particularly in the UK, where there were few radio and TV outlets for rock music. Without the band's consent, however, some songs were released as singles, particularly in the US.{{sfn|Wall|2008|pp=166\u2013167}} In 1969 an edited version of \"[[Whole Lotta Love]]\", a track from their second album, was released as a single in the US. It reached number four in the ''Billboard'' chart in January 1970, selling over one million copies and helping to cement the band's popularity.{{sfn|Wall|2008|p=165}} The group also increasingly shunned television appearances, citing their preference that their fans hear and see them in live concerts.{{sfn|Welch|1994|p=49}}{{sfn|Wale|1973|p=11}}\n\nFollowing the second album's release, Led Zeppelin completed several more US tours. They played initially in clubs and ballrooms, and then in larger auditoriums as their popularity grew.{{sfn|Erlewine|2011a}} Some early [[Led Zeppelin concerts]] lasted more than four hours, with expanded and improvised live versions of their repertoire. Many of these shows have been preserved as [[Led Zeppelin bootleg recordings|bootleg recordings]]. It was during this period of intensive concert touring that the band developed a reputation for off-stage excess.{{sfn|Wall|2008}} One alleged example of such extravagance was the [[shark episode]] said to have taken place at the [[The Edgewater|Edgewater Inn]] in [[Seattle]] on 28 July 1969.{{sfn|Davis|1985|p=103}}{{sfn|Wall|2008}}\n\nIn 1970 Page and Plant retired to [[Bron-Yr-Aur]], a remote cottage in [[Wales]], to commence work on their third album, ''[[Led Zeppelin III]]''.{{sfn|BBC Wales Music|2011}} The result was a more acoustic style that was strongly influenced by [[folk music|folk]] and [[Celtic music]], and showcased the band's versatility. The album's rich acoustic sound initially received mixed reactions, with critics and fans surprised at the turn from the primarily electric [[arrangement]]s of the first two albums, further fuelling the band's hostility to the musical press.{{sfn|Wall|2008|pp=208\u2013209}} It reached number one in the UK and US charts, but its stay would be the shortest of their first five albums.{{sfn|Yorke|1993|p=130}} The album's opening track, \"[[Immigrant Song]]\", was released as a US single in November 1970 against the band's wishes, reaching the top twenty on the ''Billboard'' chart.{{sfn|Yorke|1993|p=129}}{{clear}}\n\n===\"The Biggest Band in the World\": 1971\u201375===\n[[File:Zoso.svg|thumb|right|The four symbols on the label and inside sleeve of ''[[Led Zeppelin IV]]'', representing (from left to right) Page, Jones, Bonham, and Plant|alt=Four symbols representing the four members of Led Zeppelin in a horizontal row]]\nIn the 1970s Led Zeppelin reached new heights of commercial and critical success that made them one of the most influential groups of the era, dwarfing their earlier achievements.{{sfn|Waksman|2001|p=238}}{{sfn|Wall|2008}} The band's image also changed as the members began to wear elaborate, flamboyant clothing.{{sfn|Wall|2008|pp=296\u2013297}} Led Zeppelin began travelling in a private jet airliner, a [[Boeing 720]], (nicknamed ''[[the Starship]]''), rented out entire sections of hotels (including the [[Andaz West Hollywood|Continental Hyatt House]] in Los Angeles, known colloquially as the \"Riot House\"), and became the subject of frequently repeated stories of debauchery. One involved John Bonham riding a motorcycle through a rented floor of the Riot House,{{sfn|Wall|2008|pp=297\u2013298}} while another involved the destruction of a room in the Tokyo [[Hilton Hotels & Resorts|Hilton]], leading to the group being banned from that establishment for life.{{sfn|Williamson|2005|p=68}} Although Led Zeppelin developed a reputation for trashing their hotel suites and throwing television sets out of the windows, some suggest that these tales have been exaggerated. Music journalist [[Chris Welch]] argues that \"[Led Zeppelin's] travels spawned many stories, but it was a myth that [they] were constantly engaged in acts of wanton destruction and lewd behaviour\".{{sfn|Welch|1994|p=47}}\n\n[[File:Led Zeppelin acoustic 1973.jpg|thumb|left|Plant and Page perform acoustically in Hamburg in March 1973, just before the release of the band's fifth album, ''[[Houses of the Holy]]''|alt=A black and white photograph of Robert Plant with a tambourine and Jimmy Page with an acoustic guitar seated and performing]]\n\nLed Zeppelin released their [[Led Zeppelin IV|fourth album]] on 8 November 1971. In response to the treatment the band had received from critics, particularly after ''Led Zeppelin III'', the band decided to release the fourth album with no title, though it is variously referred to as ''Led Zeppelin IV'', ''Untitled'', ''IV'', or, due to the four symbols appearing on the record label, as ''Four Symbols'', ''Zoso'' or ''Runes''.{{sfn|Davis|2005|p=25}} In addition to lacking a title, the original cover featured no band name, as the group wished to be anonymous and to avoid easy pigeonholing by the press.{{Sfn|Wall|2008|pp=269\u2013270}} With 37 million copies sold, ''Led Zeppelin IV'' is one of the [[List of best-selling albums|best-selling albums]] in history, and its massive popularity cemented Led Zeppelin's status as superstars in the 1970s.{{sfn|Bukszpan|2003|p=128}}{{sfn|Brown|2001|p=480}} By 2006, it had sold 23&nbsp;million copies in the United States alone.{{sfn|RIAA|2009}} The track \"[[Stairway to Heaven]]\", never released as a single, is sometimes quoted as being the most requested{{Sfn|BBC Home|2011}} and most played{{sfn|Gulla|2001|p=155}} [[Album-oriented rock|album-orientated rock]] (AOR) [[FM broadcasting|FM radio]] song. The group followed up the album's release with [[Led Zeppelin United Kingdom Tour Winter 1971|tours of the UK]], [[Led Zeppelin Australasian Tour 1972|Australasia]], [[Led Zeppelin North American Tour 1972|North America]], [[Led Zeppelin Japanese Tour 1972|Japan]], and [[Led Zeppelin United Kingdom Tour 1972\u20131973|the UK again]] from late 1971 through early 1973.\n\nLed Zeppelin's next album, ''[[Houses of the Holy]]'', was released in March 1973. It featured further experimentation by the band, who expanded their use of synthesisers and [[mellotron]] orchestration. The predominately orange album cover, designed by the London-based design group [[Hipgnosis]], depicts images of nude children climbing the [[Giant's Causeway]] in Northern Ireland. Although the children are not shown from the front, the cover was controversial at the time of the album's release. As with the band's fourth album, neither their name nor the album title was printed on the sleeve.{{sfn|Wall|2008|pp=290\u2013291}}\n\n''Houses of the Holy'' topped charts worldwide,{{sfn|Wall|2008|p=294}} and the band's subsequent [[Led Zeppelin North American Tour 1973|concert tour of North America in 1973]] broke records for attendance, as they consistently filled large auditoriums and stadiums. At [[Tampa Stadium]] in Florida, they played to 56,800 fans, breaking the record set by [[The Beatles' 1965 US tour|the Beatles' 1965 Shea Stadium concert]] and grossing $309,000.{{sfn|Davis|1985|p=194}} Three sold-out shows at [[Madison Square Garden]] in New York City were filmed for a motion picture, but the theatrical release of this project (''[[The Song Remains the Same (film)|The Song Remains the Same]]'') was delayed until 1976. Before the final night's performance, $180,000 of the band's money from gate receipts was stolen from a safe deposit box at the [[Drake Hotel (New York City)|Drake Hotel]].{{sfn|Yorke|1993|pp=186\u2013187}}\n\n[[File:LedZeppelinChicago75 2.jpg|thumb|Led Zeppelin perform at [[Chicago Stadium]] in January 1975, a few weeks before the release of ''[[Physical Graffiti]]''|alt=A colour photograph of the four members of Led Zeppelin performing onstage, with some other figures visible in the background]]\n\nIn 1974, Led Zeppelin took a break from touring and launched their own record label, [[Swan Song Records|Swan Song]], named after an unreleased song. The record label's logo, based on a drawing called ''Evening: Fall of Day'' (1869) by [[William Rimmer]], features a picture of [[Apollo]].{{sfn|Williamson|2007|p=107}} The logo can be found on Led Zeppelin memorabilia, especially t-shirts. In addition to using Swan Song as a vehicle to promote their own albums, the band expanded the label's roster, signing artists such as [[Bad Company]], [[the Pretty Things]] and [[Maggie Bell]].{{sfn|Yorke|1993|p=191}} The label was successful while Led Zeppelin existed, but folded less than three years after they disbanded.{{sfn|Davis|1985|p=312}}\n\nIn 1975, Led Zeppelin's double album ''[[Physical Graffiti]]'' was their first release on the Swan Song label. It consisted of fifteen songs, of which eight had been recorded at [[Headley Grange]] in 1974 and seven had been recorded earlier. A review in ''Rolling Stone'' magazine referred to ''Physical Graffiti'' as Led Zeppelin's \"bid for artistic respectability\", adding that the only bands Led Zeppelin had to compete with for the title \"The World's Best Rock Band\" were [[the Rolling Stones]] and the Who.{{sfn|Miller|1975}} The album was a massive fiscal and critical success. Shortly after the release of ''Physical Graffiti'', all previous Led Zeppelin albums simultaneously re-entered the top-200 album chart,{{sfn|Davis|1985|pp=225, 277}} and the band embarked on another [[Led Zeppelin North American Tour 1975|North American tour]],{{sfn|Wall|2008|p=359}} now employing sophisticated sound and lighting systems.{{sfn|Yorke|1993|p=197}} In May 1975, Led Zeppelin played five sold-out nights at the [[Earls Court Exhibition Centre|Earls Court Arena]] in London, at the time the largest arena in Britain.{{sfn|Wall|2008|p=359}}\n\n===Hiatus from touring and return: 1975\u201377===\nFollowing their triumphant [[Earls Court 1975|Earls Court appearances]], Led Zeppelin took a holiday and planned an autumn tour in America, scheduled to open with two outdoor dates in San Francisco.{{sfn|Lewis|2003|p=35}} In August 1975, however, Plant and his wife Maureen were involved in a serious car crash while on holiday in [[Rhodes]], Greece. Plant suffered a broken ankle and Maureen was badly injured; a blood transfusion saved her life.{{sfn|Davis|1985|pp=354\u2013355}} Unable to tour, he headed to the [[Channel Islands|Channel Island]] of [[Jersey]] to spend August and September recuperating, with Bonham and Page in tow. The band then reconvened in [[Malibu, California]]. During this forced hiatus much of the material for their next album, ''[[Presence (album)|Presence]]'', was written.{{sfn|Wall|2008|p=364}}\n\n[[File:Jimmy Page with Robert Plant 2 - Led Zeppelin - 1977.jpg|thumb|Plant and Page perform in Chicago in April 1977, during Led Zeppelin's last North American tour|alt=A colour photograph of Robert Plant with microphone and Jimmy Page with a double necked guitar performing on stage.]]\n\nBy this time, Led Zeppelin were the world's number one rock attraction,{{sfn|Lewis|2003|p=45}} having outsold most bands of the time, including the Rolling Stones.{{sfn|Davis|1985|p=173}} ''Presence'', released in March 1976, marked a change in the Led Zeppelin sound towards more straightforward, guitar-based jams, departing from the acoustic ballads and intricate arrangements featured on their previous albums. Though it was a [[Music recording sales certification|platinum]] seller, ''Presence'' received a mixed reaction among fans and the music press, with some critics suggesting that the band's excesses may have caught up with them.{{sfn|Erlewine|2011a}}{{sfn|Davis|1976}} Page had begun using heroin during recording sessions for the album, a habit which may have affected the band's later live shows and studio recordings the band, although this has been denied by Page.{{sfn|Wall|2008|p=364}}\n\nBecause of Plant's injuries, Led Zeppelin did not tour in 1976. Instead, the band completed the concert film ''[[The Song Remains the Same (film)|The Song Remains the Same]]'' and the accompanying [[The Song Remains the Same (album)|soundtrack album]]. The film premiered in New York City on 20 October 1976, but was given a lukewarm reception by critics and fans.{{sfn|Erlewine|2011a}} The film was particularly unsuccessful in the UK, where, unwilling to tour since 1975 because of their [[tax exile]] status, Led Zeppelin faced an uphill battle to recapture the public's affection.{{sfn|Shadwick|2005|p=320}}\n\nIn 1977, Led Zeppelin embarked on another major [[Led Zeppelin North American Tour 1977|concert tour of North America]]. The band set another attendance record, with an audience of 76,229 at their [[Silverdome]] concert on 30 April.{{sfn|Yorke|1993|p=229}} It was, according to the ''[[Guinness World Records|Guinness Book of Records]]'', the largest attendance to that date for a single act show.{{sfn|Lewis|2003|p=49}} Although the tour was financially profitable, it was beset by off-stage problems. On 19 April, over 70 people were arrested as about 1,000 fans tried to gatecrash Cincinnati Riverfront Coliseum for two sold-out concerts, while others tried to gain entry by throwing rocks and bottles through glass doors.{{sfn|Wall|2008|p=392}} On 3 June, a concert at Tampa Stadium was cut short because of a severe thunderstorm, despite tickets indicating \"Rain or Shine\". A riot broke out, resulting in arrests and injuries.{{sfn|Newswire|2011}}\n\nAfter the 23 July show at the [[Days on the Green]] festival at the [[O.co Coliseum|Oakland Coliseum]] in [[Oakland, California]], Bonham and members of the band's support staff were arrested after a member of promoter [[Bill Graham (promoter)|Bill Graham]]'s staff was badly beaten during the band's performance.{{sfn|Davis|1985|p=277}}{{sfn|Yorke|1993|p=210}} The following day's second Oakland concert was the band's final live appearance in the United States. Two days later, as the band checked in at a [[French Quarter]] hotel for their 30 July performance at the [[Mercedes-Benz Superdome|Louisiana Superdome]], Plant received news that his five-year-old son, Karac, had died from a stomach virus.

On 27 June, at a show in [[Nuremberg]], Germany, the concert came to an abrupt halt in the middle of the third song, when Bonham collapsed onstage and was rushed to hospital.{{sfn|Wall|2008|pp=431\u2013432}} Speculation in the press suggested that his collapse had been the result of excessive alcohol and drug use, but the band claimed that he had simply overeaten.{{sfn|Davis|1985|p=300}}\n\nA North American tour, the band's first since 1977, was scheduled to commence on 17 October 1980. On 24 September, Bonham was picked up by Led Zeppelin assistant Rex King to attend rehearsals at [[Bray Studios (UK)|Bray Studios]].{{sfn|Welch|1994|p=92}} During the journey, Bonham asked to stop for breakfast, where he downed four quadruple vodkas (450&nbsp;ml/15 oz.), with a ham roll. After taking a bite of the ham roll he said to his assistant, \"breakfast\". He continued to drink heavily after arriving at the studio. The rehearsals were halted late that evening and the band retired to Page's house\u2014the Old Mill House in [[Clewer]], [[Windsor, Berkshire|Windsor]]. After midnight, Bonham, who had fallen asleep, was taken to bed and placed on his side. At 1:45&nbsp;pm the next day, Benji LeFevre (Led Zeppelin's new tour manager) and John Paul Jones found Bonham dead. The cause of death was asphyxiation from vomit; an autopsy found no other drugs in his body. Bonham was cremated on 10 October 1980, and his ashes were buried at Rushock Parish Church in [[Droitwich Spa|Droitwich]], Worcestershire. A verdict of accidental death was returned at an inquest held on 27 October.{{sfn|Welch|1994|p=92}}\n\nThe planned North American tour was cancelled, and despite rumours that [[Cozy Powell]], [[Carmine Appice]], [[Barriemore Barlow]], [[Simon Kirke]] or [[Bev Bevan]] would join the group as his replacement, the remaining members decided to disband. A 4 December 1980 press statement stated that, \"We wish it to be known that the loss of our dear friend, and the deep sense of undivided harmony felt by ourselves and our manager, have led us to decide that we could not continue as we were\". The statement was signed simply \"Led Zeppelin\".{{sfn|Welch|1994|pp=94\u201395}}\n\n===Post-breakup===\n\n====1980s====\n[[File:Jimmy Page 1983.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Page performs at the [[Cow Palace]] in Daly City, California in 1983|alt=A colour photograph of Jimmy Page performing on stage with a double-necked guitar]]\n\nFollowing the dissolution of Led Zeppelin, the first significant project for the band members was [[the Honeydrippers]], which Plant formed in 1981. The group featured Page on lead guitar, along with studio musicians and friends of Plant and Page, including Jeff Beck, [[Paul Shaffer]], and [[Nile Rodgers]]. Plant focused the band in a different direction from Led Zeppelin, playing [[Standard (music)|standards]] and in a more [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]] style, highlighted by their cover of \"[[Sea of Love (song)|Sea of Love]]\", which peaked at number three on the [[Billboard charts|''Billboard'' charts]] in early 1985.{{sfn|Huey|2011}}\n\n1982 saw the release of ''[[Coda (album)|Coda]]'', a collection of outtakes and unused tracks from the band's career. It included two tracks taken from the band's performance at the [[Royal Albert Hall]] in 1970, one each from the ''Led Zeppelin III'' and ''Houses of the Holy'' sessions, and three from the ''In Through the Out Door'' sessions. It also featured a 1976 Bonham drum instrumental with electronic effects added by Page, called \"[[Bonzo's Montreux]]\".{{sfn|Yorke|1993|p=267}}\n\nOn 13 July 1985, Page, Plant and Jones reunited for the [[Live Aid]] concert at [[John F.

Collins had contributed to Plant's first two solo albums while Martinez was a member of Plant's group Band of Joy. The performance was marred by the lack of rehearsal with the two drummers, Page's struggles with an out-of-tune guitar, poorly functioning monitors, and by Plant's hoarse voice.{{sfn|Lewis & Pallett|1997|p=139}}{{sfn|Prato|2008}} Page described the performance as \"pretty shambolic\",{{sfn|List|2007}} while Plant characterised it as an \"atrocity\".{{sfn|Lewis & Pallett|1997|p=139}}\n\nThe three members reunited again on 14 May 1988, for the [[Atlantic Records 40th Anniversary]] concert, with Bonham's son, [[Jason Bonham]], on drums.
