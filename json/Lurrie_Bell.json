His father was renowned blues harmonica player [[Carey Bell]].\n\n==Career==\nBell started playing guitar at the age of six, and in his teens he polished his skills playing with the legends of [[Chicago blues]] scene including [[Eddy Clearwater]], [[Big Walter Horton]] and [[Eddie Taylor]]. \n\n[[File:Lurrie Bell 1980.jpg|thumb|210px|left|Bell in Paris, May, 30, 1980]]\nIn the mid 1970s, he went on to join [[Koko Taylor]]'s Blues Machine and he toured with the band for four years. He made his recording debut in 1977 appearing on his father's album ''Heartaches and Pain'' and also on [[Eddie C. Campbell]]'s ''King of the Jungle''.<ref name=\"amg\" /><ref name=\"bio\">[http://www.lurrie.com/lurriebellstory.html ]{{dead link|date=May 2014}}</ref> It was around that time that he formed The Sons of Blues with musicians including [[Billy Branch]] on harmonica.<ref name=\"russell\">{{cite book\n| first= Tony\n| last= Russell\n| year= 1997\n| title= The Blues \u2013 From Robert Johnson to Robert Cray\n| edition= \n| publisher=Carlton Books Limited \n| location= Dubai\n| page= 90\n| isbn= 1-85868-255-X}}</ref> Three tracks of the band's recordings were featured in the [[Alligator Records]] [[compilation album|compilation]] ''Living Chicago Blues Vol. 3'' released in 1978. In 1989 he released his first solo effort, ''Everybody Wants To Win'', on [[JSP Records]].\n\nThough Bell's career appeared to be headed in the right direction, drawing attention of the blues fans around the world as a young prodigy of the blues, he battled emotional problems and [[drug abuse]] for many years, which kept him away from performing on regular basis.<ref name=\"russell\"/>\n\nHe began a comeback in 1995 with the well-received album ''Mercurial Son'', his first of several from the [[Delmark Records|Delmark]] [[record label|label]]. A series of albums followed thereafter, and he started to perform more frequently in the Chicago club and blues festival circuits.\n\nBell is featured on ''Gettin' Up \u2013 Live at Buddy Guy's Legends, Rosa's and Lurrie's Home'', a 2007 CD and DVD release from Delmark, where he plays with his father Carey. Soon after this release, Carey died and this became his last recorded effort.{{when?|date= December 2012}}\n\nIn 2014, Bell won a [[Blues Music Award]] for his track \"Blues in my Soul\", in the 'Song of the Year' category.
