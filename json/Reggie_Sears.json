Sears slowly built a strong fan base in the Southern Soul market by tirelessly touring the south's \u201cChitlin circuit\u201d of rural juke joints, ghetto bars, and blues festivals. Despite his often suggestive lyrics and racy concert performances which was deemed too explicit for commercial audiences, he became an underground success across the South and audiences, especially female ones, flocked to see Sears in concert.<ref name=\"Artist Direct\"/>  \nHis 4th CD quietly dropped in summer 2007 with the lead single \u201cDip My Dipper\u201d faring well. In 2007 he served as musical director & lead guitarist for Miami Soul singer David Hudson as well as guitarist/bassist and musical director for The Soul Generals while recording his 5th CD \u201cSweet Thang\u201d which was shelved in 2009 and remains unreleased. By the end of the year Reggie went on hiatus from music at age 16 after personal problems arose. After a bout of depression & an attempted suicide, he turned his life over to God and began to do shows again, editing the lyrics to many of his songs and considerably cleaning up his stage show.<ref name=\"Artist Direct\"/> \nThe next few years went by with a few singles and some sporadic tour dates on the Chittlin Circuit.
