For their first tour, White also played Gretsch Anniversary Jr. with a [[Bigsby vibrato tailpiece]] and three Filtertron pickups. He also uses a Gretsch Rancher acoustic guitar and he now uses a custom Gretsch Anniversary Jr. with two cutaways, a built-in retractable microphone, and a [[theremin]] next to the Bigsby. White has dubbed this one the \"Triple Green Machine\". Also, he plays occasionally with his Gretsch Rancher, a Gibson J-160E. Also, he plays a Gretsch Duo Jet in Cadillac Green. Recently, he has featured his latest Gretsch, a custom white [[Billy Gibbons]]/[[Bo Diddley]] signature [[Gretsch Jupiter Thunderbird]] in the music video for \"Another Way to Die\", this guitar is also used on his concerts with [[the Dead Weather]], but he also uses a black left-handed one since [[Sea of Cowards]] came out. He has also been known to play [[Fender Telecasters]], featuring one in the music video for Loretta Lynn's \"Portland, Oregon.\"\n\nWhite uses numerous effects to create his live sound, most notably a [[DigiTech Whammy|DigiTech Whammy WH-4]] to create the rapid modulations in pitch he uses in his solos.<ref name=\"NYT\">Ratliff, Ben (2003). [http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C05E7DC133AF932A15757C0A9659C8B63 \"ROCK REVIEW: Contradictory and Proud of It\"]''[[The New York Times]]'' Retrieved May 2, 2006</ref>\nIn concert with an MXR Micro Amp and custom Electro-Harmonix [[Big Muff]] Distortion/Sustainer, White can produce a very distinctive sound. In 2005, for the single \"Blue Orchid,\" White employed a new [[Electro-Harmonix]] creation, the Polyphonic Octave Generator (POG). Similar to (but more versatile than) the Whammy IV, the POG lets the user mix in several octave effects into one along with the dry signal. All of the pedals that he uses live have been professionally painted red to match his red/black/white color scheme (with the exception of his Whammy and the other pedals that are already red). He plugs this setup into a 1970s [[Fender Twin Reverb]] and two 100-Watt Sears [[Silvertone (instruments)|Silvertone]] 1485 6\u00d710 amplifiers.<ref name=\"BB1\">[http://www.brokenbricks.com/guitar.shtml \"White Stripes Equipment/Technique\"] ''Broken Bricks'' Retrieved May 2, 2006</ref> With the Raconteurs, he has many more unusual pedals. And also, for the Raconteurs' 2008 tour, he had all of his pedals copper plated by [[Analog Man (instrument maker)|Analog Man]].\n\nWhite also produces a \"fake\" bass tone by playing the Kay Hollowbody and JB Hutto Montgomery Airline guitars through a Whammy IV set to one octave down for a very thick, low, rumbling sound, which he uses most notably on the songs \"[[Seven Nation Army]]\" and \"[[The Hardest Button to Button]]\" during live performances.<ref name=\"NYT\" /><ref name=\"BB2\">[http://www.brokenbricks.com/cgi-bin/tab.cgi?/tabs/Elephant/Seven%20Nation%20Army.txt ''Seven Nation Army'' tablature and notes]. ''Broken Bricks'' Retrieved May 2, 2006</ref>\n\nOn occasion, White also plays other instruments, such as a Black Gibson F-4 [[mandolin]] (\"Little Ghost\"), [[piano]] (on most tracks from ''[[Get Behind Me Satan]]'', and various others), and an [[electric piano]] on such tracks as \"The Air Near My Fingers\" and \"I'm Finding it Harder to be a Gentleman\".  White also plays [[percussion instruments]] such as the [[marimba]] (as on \"The Nurse\"), [[Drum kit|drums]] and [[tambourine]]. For the White Stripes' 2007 tour, he played a custom-finish Hammond A-100 organ with a Leslie 3300 speaker, which was subsequently loaned to [[Bob Dylan]], and currently resides at Third Man Studios.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.b3guys.com/service_customfinish.html |title='&#39;Services: Custom Finishes \u2013 B3 Guys'&#39; Retrieved on January 8, 2011 |publisher=B3guys.com |accessdate=October 4, 2011}}</ref> On ''Broken Boy Soldiers'', he is credited as playing the album's [[synth]]s and [[organ (music)|organ]]; however, bandmate [[Brendan Benson]] also received credit for these instruments and it is unclear who played on which song.\n\nWith the Dead Weather, White plays a custom Ludwig Classic Maple kit in Black Oyster Pearl. The sizes consist of the following: 16\u00d726 kick, 5\u00d716 snare (primary) 12\u00d714 marching snare (secondary), 7\u00d716 rack tom 14\u00d716 floor tom, two 16\u00d716 floor toms, Paiste 2002 24\" crash, 24\" ride and two 16\" crashes as hi-hats. For the 2009 Full Flash Blank tour, White used a drum head with the Three Brides of Dracula on the front, but in 2010, White employed a new drum head, upon the release of ''Sea of Cowards'', which has an image of The Third Man himself: Harry Lime attempting to escape certain capture in the sewers of Vienna. During the American leg of the 2010 tour, White switched his drum head again featuring a picture of himself in the guise he wore on the cover of ''Sea of Cowards''. This drum head is called Sam Kay by some fans, referring to the insert inside of the 12\" LP.\n\nIn 2010, White added an acoustic guitar to his collection named [[Veronica Lake]]. It is a custom white Gretsch Rancher with a gold double pickguard and a picture of Veronica Lake on the back. He is currently playing it with his band The Dead Weather. It is the newest addition to \"Jack's Girlfriends\" which already include [[Claudette Colbert]] that he plays In the Raconteurs, and [[Rita Hayworth]] that he plays in the White Stripes.\n\nIn his introduction in the documentary film, ''[[It Might Get Loud]]'', White showcases his minimalist style and ingenuity by constructing a rudimentary guitar in a pastoral setting. The \"guitar\" was built out of a plank of wood, two nails, a glass [[Coke bottle]], a guitar string, and a pickup. He ends the demonstration by saying, \"Who says you need to buy a guitar?\"\n\nAn important aspect of the sound of White's recordings comes from the fact that they are recorded on analog equipment. White has long been a proponent of analog equipment and the associated working methods, stating in a 2012 interview, \"I love analogue because of what it makes you do. Digital recording gives you all this freedom, all these options to change the sounds that you are putting down, and those are for the most part not good choices to have for an artist,\" and \"Mechanics are always going to provide inherent little flaws and tiny little specks and hisses that will add to the idea of something beautiful, something romantic. Perfection, making things perfectly in time and perfectly free of extraneous noise, is not something to aspire to! Why would anyone to aspire to such a thing?\".<ref name=\"Jack & White Vision\">{{cite web|url=http://tingen.org/jack-white-vision |title=Jack & White Vision |accessdate=2014-03-26}}</ref>\n\nWhite founded his own studio, Third Man, in 2009, and its main pieces of equipment are a Neve desk and two Studer A800 2-inch 8-track tape recorders. His solo album, ''[[Blunderbuss (album)|Blunderbuss]]'', and the material he releases on his Third Man label are recorded at his own studio. He explained, \"For the longest time I did not want to have my own studio gear, mostly because with the White Stripes I wanted to have the constriction of going into a studio and having a set time of 10 days or two weeks to finish an album, and using whatever gear they happen to have there. After 10 to 15 years of recording like that I felt that it was finally time for me to have my own place to produce music, and have exactly what I want in there: the exact tape machines, the exact microphones, the exact amplifiers that I like, and so on.\"<ref name=\"Jack & White Vision\"/>\n\n==Personal life==\n[[File:Meg White.jpg|thumb|Drummer [[Meg White]] is Jack White's ex-wife.]]\n\nWhite has been married twice and divorced twice.  He has two children.  He is protective of his family's privacy and gives few details of his private life. He states that he does not consider it relevant to his art, saying \"It's the same thing as asking [[Michelangelo]], 'What kind of shoes do you wear?'...In the end, it doesn't really matter ... the only thing that's going to be left is our records and photos.\"<ref name=\"married\">Brian [http://www.whitestripes.net/faq.php#brosis \"The Unofficial White Stripes FAQ Version 6\"].
