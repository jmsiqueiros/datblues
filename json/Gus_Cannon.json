There is doubt about his birth year; his tombstone gives the date as 1874.<ref>{{Find a Grave|11647}}</ref>\n\n==Career==\nBorn on a plantation at Red Banks, Cannon moved to [[Clarksdale, Mississippi]], then the home of [[W. C. Handy]], at the age of 12. Cannon's musical skills came without training; he taught himself to play using a [[banjo]] that he made from a frying pan and [[raccoon]] skin. He ran away from home at the age of fifteen and began his career entertaining at [[sawmill]]s and [[levee]] and [[railroad]] camps in the [[Mississippi Delta]] around the turn of the century.\n\nWhile in Clarksdale, Cannon was influenced by local musicians Jim Turner and Alec Lee. Turner's [[fiddle]] playing in W. C. Handy\u2019s band so impressed Cannon that he decided to learn the fiddle himself. Lee, a guitarist, taught Cannon his first folk blues, \"Po' Boy, Long Ways from Home\", and showed him how to use a knife blade as a [[slide guitar|slide]], a technique that Cannon adapted to his banjo playing.<ref name= barlow>Barlow, William. ''\"Looking Up At Down\": The Emergence of Blues Culture''. Temple University Press (1989), pp. 214-17. ISBN 0-87722-583-4.</ref>\n\nCannon left Clarksdale around 1907. He soon settled near [[Memphis, Tennessee]] and played in a jug band led by Jim Guffin.<ref name=barlow/>  He began playing in Memphis with [[Jim Jackson (musician)|Jim Jackson]]. He met [[harmonica]] player [[Noah Lewis]], who introduced him to a young guitar player named Ashley Thompson. Both Lewis and Thompson would eventually become members of Cannon's Jug Stompers. The three of them formed a band to play parties and dances. In 1914 Cannon began touring in [[medicine show]]s.<ref name=barlow/> He supported his family through a variety of jobs, including sharecropping, ditch digging, and yard work, but supplemented his income with music.\n\nCannon began recording as \"Banjo Joe\" for [[Paramount Records]] in 1927. At that session he was backed up by [[Blind Blake]].<ref name=barlow/>  After the success of the [[Memphis Jug Band]]'s first records, he quickly assembled a jug band featuring Noah Lewis and Ashley Thompson (later replaced by Elijah Avery).<ref name=\"russell\">{{cite book\n| first= Tony\n| last= Russell\n| year= 1997\n| title= The Blues - From Robert Johnson to Robert Cray\n| edition= \n| publisher=Carlton Books Limited \n| location= Dubai\n| pages= 99\n| isbn= 1-85868-255-X}}</ref>  Cannon's Jug Stompers first recorded at the Memphis Auditorium for the [[Victor Records|Victor]] record label in January 1928. Hosea Woods joined the Jug Stompers in the late 1920s, playing guitar, banjo and [[kazoo]], and also providing some vocals. Modern listeners can hear Cannon's Jug Stompers recording of \"Big Railroad Blues\" on the [[compilation album]] ''[[The Music Never Stopped: Roots of the Grateful Dead]]''.\n\nAlthough their last recordings were made in 1930, Cannon's Jug Stompers were one of [[Beale Street]]'s most popular jug bands through the 1930s. A few songs Cannon recorded with Cannon's Jug Stompers are \"Minglewood Blues\", \"Pig Ankle Strut\", \"[[Wolf River (Tennessee)|Wolf River]] Blues\", \"Viola Lee Blues\", \"White House Station\" and \"[[Walk Right In]]\" (later made into a pop hit by [[The Rooftop Singers]]<ref name=\"russell\"/> in the 1960s, and later a hit rock/pop version by Dr. Hook in the 1970s). By the end of the 1930s, Cannon had effectively retired, although he occasionally performed as a solo musician.\n\nHe returned in 1956 to make a few recordings for [[Folkways Records]]. In the \"blues revival\" of the 1960s, he made some college and [[coffee house]] appearances with [[Furry Lewis]] and [[Bukka White]],<ref name=\"russell\"/> but he had to pawn his banjo to pay his heating bill the winter before the Rooftop Singers had a hit with \"Walk Right In\".<ref>[[Fred Bronson]] (2003), \"Walk Right In\", in ''The Billboard Book of #1 Hits'', New York:  Billboard Publications, Fifth Edition.</ref>\n\nIn the wake of becoming a hit composer, he recorded an album for [[Stax Records]] in 1963, with fellow Memphis musicians [[Will Shade]], the former leader of the Memphis Jug Band, on jug and Milton Roby on washboard. Cannon performs a series of traditional songs, including \"Kill It,\" \"Salty Dog,\" \"Going Around,\" \"The Mountain,\" \"Ol' Hen\", \"Gonna Raise A Ruckus Tonight,\"  \"Ain't Gonna Rain No More,\" \"Boll-Weevil,\" \"Come On Down To My House,\" \"[[Make Me a Pallet on Your Floor]],\" \"Get Up In The Morning Soon,\" and \"Crawdad Hole\" along with his own \"Walk Right In,\" plus various stories and introductions between the songs. The album is almost an audio documentary tour through different corners of Cannon's life and career that, ideally, might've run to several volumes.<ref>Vladimir, Bogdanov.

(1929 film)|Hallelujah!]]'' (1929), during the late night wedding scene.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.wirz.de/music/cannon.htm Illustrated Gus Cannon discography]\n* [https://archive.org/details/GusCannon-MadisonStreetRag Madison Street Rag -- Gus Cannon]\n* [https://archive.org/details/GusCannon-BollWeevil Boll Weevil -- Gus Cannon]\n* [https://archive.org/details/Minglewood Minglewood Blues -- Gus Cannon and his Jug Stompers]\n\n{{Authority control|VIAF=54332020}}\n\n{{Persondata         <!-- Metadata: see [[Wikipedia:Persondata]] -->\n| NAME              = Cannon, Gus\n| ALTERNATIVE NAMES =\n| SHORT DESCRIPTION = [[United States|American]] [[blues]] musician\n| DATE OF BIRTH     = September 12, 1883\n| PLACE OF BIRTH    = Red Banks, [[Mississippi]], [[United States]]\n| DATE OF DEATH     = October 15, 1979\n| PLACE OF DEATH    = [[Memphis, Tennessee]], United States \n}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Cannon, Gus}}\n[[Category:1883 births]]\n[[Category:1979 deaths]]\n[[Category:Country blues musicians]]\n[[Category:African-American banjoists]]\n[[Category:American blues musicians]]\n[[Category:American buskers]]\n[[Category:People from Marshall County, Mississippi]]\n[[Category:Stax Records artists]]"}]}}}}
