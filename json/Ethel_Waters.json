She frequently performed jazz, big band, and pop music, on the [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] stage and in concerts, although she began her career in the 1920s singing blues.\n\nHer best-known recordings include \"[[Dinah (song)|Dinah]],\" \"[[Stormy Weather (song)|Stormy Weather]],\" \"[[Taking a Chance on Love]],\" \"[[Heat Wave (Irving Berlin song)|Heat Wave]],\" \"[[Supper Time]],\" \"[[Am I Blue?]]\" and \"[[Cabin in the Sky]],\" as well as her version of the [[spiritual (music)|spiritual]] \"[[His Eye Is on the Sparrow]].\" Waters was the second [[African American]], after [[Hattie McDaniel]], to be nominated for an [[Academy Award]]. She is also the first African American woman to be nominated for an [[Emmy Award]], in 1962.\n\n==Early life==\nEthel Waters was born in [[Chester, Pennsylvania]], on October 31, 1896, as a result of the rape of her teenaged mother, Louise Anderson (believed to have been thirteen years old at the time, although some sources indicate she may have been slightly older), by John Waters, a pianist and family acquaintance from a mixed-race middle-class background. Waters played no role in raising Ethel.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://afroamhistory.about.com/od/ethelwaters/a/bio_waters_e.htm|title=Remembering the Career of Ethel Waters|author=Jessica McElrath|accessdate=July 23, 2009}}</ref> Ethel Waters was raised in poverty and never lived in the same place for more than 15 months. She said of her difficult childhood, \"I never was a child. I never was cuddled, or liked, or understood by my family.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Waters|first=Ethel |coauthor=Samuels, Charles T.|title=His Eye on the Sparrow: An Autobiography|location=New York|publisher=Doubleday & Company, Inc.|year=1951}}</ref>\n\nWaters grew tall, standing 5'9\u00bd\" in her teens. According to women-in-jazz historian and archivist [[Rosetta Reitz]], Waters' birth in the North and her peripatetic life exposed her to many cultures.\n\nWaters married at the age of 13, but soon left her abusive husband and became a maid in a Philadelphia hotel working for $4.75 per week. On her 17th birthday, she attended a costume party at a nightclub on Juniper Street. She was persuaded to sing two songs, and impressed the audience so much that she was offered professional work at the Lincoln Theatre in [[Baltimore]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=KpI8AAAAIBAJ&sjid=7SkMAAAAIBAJ&pg=2759,6335293&dq=ernestine+wade&hl=en|title=50th Year for Lincoln Theater|date=September 12, 1959|publisher=Baltimore Afro American|accessdate=March 17, 2011}}</ref> She later recalled that she earned the rich sum of ten dollars a week, but her managers cheated her out of the tips her admirers threw on the stage.\n\n==Career==\n[[File:Ethel Waters.png|thumb|200px|right|Waters inducted into [[Zeta Phi Eta]] at University of Michigan]]\nAfter her start in Baltimore, Waters toured on the black vaudeville circuit.

Waters enjoyed her time with the carnival and recalled, \"the roustabouts and the concessionaires were the kind of people I'd grown up with, rough, tough, full of larceny towards strangers, but sentimental and loyal to their friends and co-workers.\" She did not last long with them, though, and soon headed south to [[Atlanta, Georgia|Atlanta]], where she worked in the same club with [[Bessie Smith]]. Smith demanded that Waters not compete in singing blues opposite her. Waters conceded and sang [[ballad (music)|ballads]] and popular songs. Around 1919, Waters moved to [[Harlem]] and there became a celebrity performer in the [[Harlem Renaissance]] during the 1920s.\n\nWaters obtained her first Harlem job at [[Edmond's Cellar]], a club that had a black patronage. She specialized in popular ballads and became an actress in a [[blackface]] comedy called ''[[Hello 1919]].'' Jazz historian [[Rosetta Reitz]] points out that by the time Waters returned to Harlem in 1921, women blues singers were among the most powerful entertainers in the country. In 1921, Waters became the fifth black woman to make a record, on the tiny Cardinal Records label. She later joined [[Black Swan Records]], where [[Fletcher Henderson]] was her accompanist. Waters later commented that Henderson tended to perform in a more classical style than she would prefer, often lacking \"the damn-it-to-hell bass.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Waters|first=Ethel |coauthor=Samuels, Charles T.|title=His Eye on the Sparrow: An Autobiography|location=New York|publisher=Da Capo Press| page=147| year=1992}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Ethel Waters - William P. Gottlieb.jpg|thumb|left|Candid photo of Waters]]\nShe recorded with [[Black Swan Records|Black Swan]] from 1921 through 1923. In early 1924, [[Paramount Records|Paramount]] bought the Black Swan label, and she stayed with Paramount through that year. Waters first recorded for [[Columbia Records]] in 1925, achieving a hit with her voicing of [[Dinah (song)|\"Dinah\"]], which was voted a [[Grammy Hall of Fame Award]] in 1998. Soon after, she started working with Pearl Wright, and together they toured in the South. In 1924, Waters played at the [[Plantation Club]] on [[Broadway (New York City)|Broadway]]. She also toured with the Black Swan Dance Masters. With Earl Dancer, she joined what was called the \"white time\" [[Keith Vaudeville Circuit]], a traditional white-audience based vaudeville circuit combined with screenings of silent movies. They received rave reviews in Chicago and earned the unheard of salary of US$1,250 in 1928. In 1929, Waters and Pearl Wright arranged the unreleased [[Harry Akst]] song \"[[Am I Blue?]],\" which then appeared in the movie ''[[On with the Show (1929 film)|On with the Show]]'' and became a hit and her signature tune.<ref name=\"Heat Wave\">{{cite book|last=Bogle|first=Donald|title=Heat Wave: The Life and Career of Ethel Waters|year=2011|publisher=HarperCollins|isbn=9780062041722|pages=656|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=3ZYX0iZtjJUC}}</ref>\n\nAlthough she was considered a blues singer during the pre-1925 period, Waters belonged to the vaudeville style of [[Mamie Smith]], [[Viola McCoy]], and [[Lucille Hegamin]].  While with Columbia, she introduced many popular standards including \"Dinah,\" \"Heebie Jeebies,\" \"Sweet Georgia Brown,\" \"Someday, Sweetheart,\" \"Am I Blue?\" and \"(What Did I Do To Be So) Black and Blue\" on the popular series, while she continued to sing blues (like \"West End Blues,\" \"Organ Grinder Blues,\" etc.) on Columbia's 14000 race series. During the 1920s, Waters performed and was recorded with the ensembles of [[Will Marion Cook]] and [[Lovie Austin]]. As her career continued, she evolved toward being a [[blues]] and [[Broadway theater|Broadway]] singer, performing with artists such as [[Duke Ellington]]. She remained with Columbia through 1931. She then signed with Brunswick in 1932 and remained until 1933 when she went back to Columbia. She signed with Decca in late 1934 for only two sessions, as well as a single session in early 1938. She recorded for the specialty label \"Liberty Music Shops\" in 1935 and again in 1940.  Between 1938 and 1939, she recorded for Bluebird. {{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}\n\nIn 1933, Waters made a satirical all-black film entitled ''[[Rufus Jones for President]]'', which featured then-child performer [[Sammy Davis Jr.]] as Rufus Jones. She went on to star at the [[Cotton Club]], where, according to her autobiography, she \"sang '[[Stormy Weather (song)|Stormy Weather]]' from the depths of the private hell in which I was being crushed and suffocated.\" She had a featured role in the wildly successful [[Irving Berlin]] Broadway musical revue ''[[As Thousands Cheer]]'' in 1933, where she was the first black woman in an otherwise white show. She had three gigs at this point; in addition to the show, she starred in a national radio program and continued to work in nightclubs. She was the highest paid performer on Broadway at that time. [[MGM]] hired [[Lena Horne]] as the ingenue in the all-Black musical ''[[Cabin in the Sky]]'', and Waters starred as Petunia in 1942, reprising her stage role of 1940. The film, directed by [[Vincente Minnelli]], was a success.\n\n[[File:CountBasieEthelWatersStageDoorCanteen2.jpg|thumb|260px|Waters with [[Count Basie]] in ''[[Stage Door Canteen]]'' (1943)]]\n\nShe began to work with Fletcher Henderson again in the late 1940s. She was nominated for a Best Supporting Actress [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] in 1949 for the film ''[[Pinky (film)|Pinky]]'', under the direction of Elia Kazan, after original director, John Ford, quit, due to his disagreements with Waters. According to producer Daryl Zanuck, Ford \"hated that old...woman (Waters).\" Ford, Kazan stated, \"Didn't know how to reach Ethel Waters.\" Kazan later referred to Water's \"Truly odd combination of old-time religiosity and free-flowing hatred.\".<ref>\"Print the Legend,\" Scott Eyman, from \"Kazan\" Publisher- Johns Hopkins University Press, 1999, p 361.</ref> In 1950, she won the [[New York Drama Critics Circle Award]] for her performance opposite [[Julie Harris]] in the play ''[[The Member of the Wedding]]''. Waters and Harris repeated their roles in the 1952 film version of ''[[Member of the Wedding]]'''' In 1950, Waters starred in the [[television series]] ''[[Beulah (series)|Beulah]]'', but quit after complaining that the scripts' portrayal of blacks was \"degrading.\" She later guest starred in 1957 and 1959 on [[NBC]]'s ''[[The Ford Show|The Ford Show, Starring Tennessee Ernie Ford]].'' In the 1957 episode, she sang \"Cabin in the Sky.\"<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=r7bTFQSfZboC&pg=PA96&lpg=PA96&dq=Ethel+Waters+%2B+Tennessee+Ernie+Ford#v=onepage&q=Ethel%20Waters%20%2B%20Tennessee%20Ernie%20Ford&f=false|title=Stephen Bourne, Ethel Waters: Stormy Weather|publisher=[[Lanham, Maryland]]: Scarecrow Press, 2007, ISBN= 0-8108-5902-5|accessdate=November 25, 2010|isbn=978-0-8108-5902-9|date=May 2007}}</ref>\n\nDespite these successes, her brilliant career was fading. She lost tens of thousands in jewelry and cash in a robbery, and had difficulties with the [[Internal Revenue Service|IRS]]. Her health suffered, and she worked only sporadically in following years. In 1950-51 she wrote the [[autobiography]] ''His Eye is on the Sparrow'' with Charles Samuels, in which she wrote candidly about her life. She explains why her age has often been misstated: her mother had had to sign a paper claiming Waters was four years older than she was, and that she was born in 1896. ''His Eye is on the Sparrow'' was adapted for a stage production in which she was portrayed by [[Ernestine Jackson]]. In her second autobiography, ''To Me, It's Wonderful,'' Waters states that she was born in 1900.<ref name=autobio2>{{cite book|last=Waters|first=Ethel|title=To Me, It's Wonderful|location=New York|publisher=Harper & Row|year=1972|oclc=329566}}</ref> [[Rosetta Reitz]] called Waters \"a natural ...
