However, he also sang and played [[jazz]], [[rock 'n' roll]] and the [[blues]]. He was associated with the hillbilly boogie style which greatly influenced [[rockabilly]]; [[Jerry Lee Lewis]] cited him as a major influence on his own singing and piano playing.\n\nMullican once stated, \"We gotta play music that'll make them goddamn beer bottles bounce on the table\".<ref name=\"Music\">{{cite book\n| first= Paul\n| last= Du Noyer\n| year= 2003\n| title= The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Music\n| edition= 1st\n| publisher= Flame Tree Publishing \n| location= Fulham, London\n| isbn= 1-904041-96-5\n| page= 199}}</ref>\n\n==Family==\nMoon was born to Oscar Luther Mullican (1876\u20131961) and his first wife, Virginia Jordan Mullican (1880\u20131915), near Corrigan, [[Polk County, Texas|Polk County]], [[Texas]].  They were a farming family of Scottish, Irish and Eastern European descent.  Moon was a descendant of the Mullikins of [[Maryland]].  His [[Ulster Scots people|Scots-Irish]] immigrant ancestor, James Mullikin, was born in Scotland, arriving in Maryland in 1630\u20131640 via Northern Ireland.  His paternal grandfather was Pvt. Wilson G. Mullican, who fought with the 6th Mississippi Infantry, CSA, at the Battle of Shiloh.  Moon's parents, stepmother and grandparents are all buried in Stryker Cemetery, Polk County, [[Texas]].\n\nAs a child, Mullican began playing the organ, which his religious father had purchased in order to better sing hymns at church.  However, Moon had befriended one of the black sharecroppers on the farm, a guitarist named Joe Jones, who introduced him to the country blues.  His religious family did not always approve, and he was torn between religion and secular music.  After making his mark as a local piano player, he left home at 16, and headed to [[Houston]], where he began playing piano and singing in local clubs.  His career choice was to be a singer or a preacher, and he chose the former.\n\n==Career==\nBy the 1930s, Mullican had earned the nickname \"Moon\", either short for \"[[moonshine]]\" or from his all-night performances (sources differ). \nHis earliest influences were popular blues artists of the day such as [[Bessie Smith]], [[Blind Lemon Jefferson]] and [[Leroy Carr]], together with country musicians including [[Jimmie Rodgers (country singer)|Jimmie Rodgers]] and [[Bob Wills]].<ref name=spawner>[http://www.webspawner.com/users/MoonMullican/ Moon Mullican<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> In 1936, he covered [[Cab Calloway]]'s \"Georgia Pine\" and also sung his own compositions \"Ain't You Kinda Sorry\" and \"Swing Baby Swing\" for Leon Selph's [[Western swing]] band, The Blue Ridge Playboys.  He also played and recorded with [[Cliff Bruner]]'s Texas Wanderers, the Sunshine Boys, and [[Jimmie Davis]]. By the end of the 1930s, he had also become a popular vocalist with a warm, deep, vocal delivery.\n\nIn the early 1940s, he returned to the Texas Wanderers as lead singer and pianist, sang on the hits \"Truck Driver's Blues\" and \"I'll Keep On Loving You\". However, he also made records with others including an excellent rendition of [[Irving Berlin]]'s \"Blue Skies\", the blues ballad \"Sundown Blues\", an excellent jazz/blues/gospel hybrid \"Lay me down beside my darling\" and \"Pipeliner Blues\" (a song that he would return to many a time). His style at this time was very similar to rock 'n' roll. Many would not have recognised him as a country artist.\n\nAs well as writing his own original blues songs, Moon also covered many of the African American blues of his time. These included the [[Leroy Carr]]/[[Tampa Red]] blues \"Mean mistreater\", [[Papa Charlie McCoy]]'s \"Too long\", [[Ollie Shepard]]'s \"Kangaroo blues\" and [[Georgia South]]'s \"New falling rain blues\".\n\nIn 1945, he put together his own band, the Showboys, who quickly became one of the most popular outfits in the Texas/Louisiana area with a mix of country music, Western swing, and Mullican's wild piano playing and singing. Although their style was highly eclectic and included country ballads, some of their music clearly foreshadowed what would later be called rock and roll. In 1946, Mullican made his first recordings as band leader, for [[King Records (USA)|King Records]] in [[Cincinnati]]. His first hit was \"New Jole Blon\" in 1947 (later recorded by [[Doug Kershaw]]), followed by the ballad \"Sweeter Than the Flowers\" in 1948. As well as the hits, he recorded many memorable and excellent songs in many styles showing a versatility that would not be seen until Jerry Lee Lewis and [[Elvis Presley]] would surface. A typical Mullican session would see him sing a country ballad one minute and then a saxophone driven blues the next. Record labels often did not know what to do with this side of his music and what he was doing would one day be called rock 'n' roll.  \n\nDuring the late 1940s, Mullican influenced many other country artists. He had defined a style of country balladeering not hinted at in his 1930s work. This style of music influenced [[Jim Reeves]] (a band member for a while), [[Hank Williams]] (who named Moon as a favorite artist), [[Hank Snow]], [[Bill Haley]], Elvis Presley, and especially Jerry Lee Lewis, who covered many of Mullican's songs.  It was in the realm of hillbilly boogie, however, that Mullican had his greatest influence. Many of his songs, such as \"Pipeliners Blues\", \"Hey! Mister Cotton-Picker\" and \"Cherokee Boogie\" (his biggest hit, in 1951) directly foreshadowed the style adopted by Haley and later [[rock and roll|rock'n'rollers]]. Moon also influenced [[Ireland|Irish]] [[country]] and [[blues]] singer Patrick Wall, and also US [[rockabilly]] / [[Western swing]] band [[Cornell Hurd]], who both did tribute CDs to mark Mullican's 100th birthday in 2009.\n\nAmong the other songs, he recorded were the Hank Williams-style \"It's a Sin to Love You Like I Do\", the clever anti-war \"When a Soldier Knocks and Finds Nobody Home\", the bluesy ballad \"There's a Chill on the Hill Tonight\", the [[Piedmont blues|Piedmont-style blues]] \"Triflin' Woman Blues\" and the [[gospel music|gospel]] anthem \"Bye and Bye\". He also ventured into pop with \"Mona Lisa\" and covered blues standards like [[Lead Belly]]'s \"Goodnight Irene\", and [[Memphis Minnie]]'s \"What's the Matter With the Mill\". Some songs, like \"The Leaves Mustn't Fall\" and \"A Crushed Red Rose\", were semi-autobiographical. He had many top 10 hits in this time including the No. 1 \"[[I'll Sail My Ship Alone]]\" as well as \"Sweeter than the Flowers\", \"Cherokee Boogie\" and many \"Jole Blon\" derivatives. He is also believed to have co-written  \"[[Jambalaya (On the Bayou)|Jambalaya]]\", made famous by Hank Williams, but which could not be credited to him because of his contract with King Records.<ref name=amg>[{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p1738|pure_url=yes}} allmusic ((( Moon Mullican > Biography )))<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> \n\nBy the end of the 1940s, he found a national audience from its radio broadcasts.  With the advent of rock 'n' roll, Mullican's style of music came to the fore.  He responded with his famous classic \"[[Seven Nights to Rock]]\" as well as \"Moon's Rock\" and many more.  He became a member of the [[Grand Ole Opry]] in 1951.<ref>{{cite web | title = Opry Timeline - 1950s | url = http://www.opry.com/about/Timeline_1950.html | date = | accessdate = July 10, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title = Country Calendar | url = http://www.talentondisplay.com/countrycalMAR.html | publisher = Bill Morrison | date = 2008 | accessdate = July 10, 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn 1958, he was signed by [[Owen Bradley]] to [[Coral Records]], and recorded an album called \"Moon Over Mullican\" which showed he could also do swing akin to [[Frank Sinatra|Sinatra]] well. He is also believed to have jammed on-stage with [[Buddy Holly]] around this time.<ref>[http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:MoREwnE_lDkJ:www.rockabillyhall.com/MoonMullican1.html+%22blue+ridge+playboys%22+bruner+moon&hl=en&ct=clnk&cd=3&gl=uk&client=firefox-a 403 Forbidden<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nIn the early 1960s, Mullican was a largely forgotten figure nationally, but based himself in Texas and carried on gigging and recording for the Starday and Spar labels. The decade saw him record country songs like \"I'll Pour the Wine\" and \"Love Don't Have a Guarantee\", together with less notable oddities including \"I Ain't No Beatle, But I Wanna Hold Your Hand\". One of his last records, \"Love That Might Have Been\", was excellent and should have been the start of a whole new stage in the singer\u2019s career. However, Moon had a heart condition, although he continued to perform regularly. On New Year's Eve 1966, he suffered a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] in [[Beaumont, Texas]], and died early in the morning on January 1, 1967.  He and his wife, Eunice, who survived him (she died in 1973), had no children.\n\nMoon's epitaph is the name of one of his many hits, \"I'll Sail My Ship Alone\".\n\nIn 1976, he was posthumously inducted into the [[Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame]]. There have been many posthumous compilations of his music, on various labels including Ace and Bear Family.<ref name=amg />\n\n==Discography==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Year\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Single\n!colspan=\"2\"|Chart Positions\n|-\n!width=\"50\"|<small>[[Hot Country Songs|US Country]]</small>\n!width=\"50\"|<small>[[Billboard Hot 100|US]]</small>\n|- \n|1936\n|\"Swing Baby Swing\"\n|align=center|5\n|align=center|\u2014\n|-\n|1938\n|\"[[I'll Keep On Loving You]]\"\n|align=center|\u2014\n|align=center|\u2014\n|-\n|-\n|1939\n|\"Truck Driver's Blues\"\n|align=center|\u2014\n|align=center|\u2014\n|-\n|rowspan=2|1947\n|\"New Pretty Blonde (Jole Blon)\"\n|align=center|2\n|align=center|\u2014\n|-\n|\"Jole Blon's Sister\"\n|align=center|4\n|align=center|\u2014\n|-\n|1948\n|\"Sweeter Than the Flowers\"\n|align=center|3\n|align=center|\u2014\n|-\n|rowspan=3|1950\n|\"[[I'll Sail My Ship Alone]]\"\n|align=center|1\n|align=center|17\n|-\n|\"[[Mona Lisa (Nat King Cole song)|Mona Lisa]]\"\n|align=center|4\n|align=center|\u2014\n|-\n|\"[[Goodnight Irene]]\"\n|align=center|5\n|align=center|\u2014\n|-\n|1951\n|\"Cherokee Boogie (Eh-Oh-Aleena)\"\n|align=center|7\n|align=center|\u2014\n|-\n|1961\n|\"Ragged but Right\"\n|align=center|15\n|align=center|\u2014\n|}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p1738|pure_url=yes}} Allmusic]\n* [http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/MM/fmuua_print.html Biography at Handbook of Texas Online]\n* [http://www.rockabillyhall.com/MoonMullican1.html Moon Mullican at Rockabilly Hall]\n* [http://www.nashvillesongwritersfoundation.com/fame/mullican.html Nashville Songwriters' Foundation]\n* [http://rcs-discography.com/rcs/artists/m/mull1000.htm A discography and audio links]\n\n\n{{Authority control|VIAF=56797156}}\n{{Persondata\n| NAME              =Mullican, Moon\n| ALTERNATIVE NAMES =\n| SHORT DESCRIPTION = American musician\n| DATE OF BIRTH     =March 29, 1909\n| PLACE OF BIRTH    = [[Polk County, Texas]], [[United States]]\n| DATE OF DEATH     =January 1, 1967\n| PLACE OF DEATH    = [[Beaumont, Texas]]\n}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Mullican, Moon}}\n[[Category:1909 births]]\n[[Category:1967 deaths]]\n[[Category:Western swing performers]]\n[[Category:American country singers]]\n[[Category:American male singers]]\n[[Category:American country singer-songwriters]]\n[[Category:Grand Ole Opry members]]\n[[Category:Blue-eyed soul singers]]\n[[Category:People from Beaumont, Texas]]\n[[Category:American people of Scotch-Irish descent]]\n[[Category:King Records artists]]\n[[Category:Starday Records artists]]\n[[Category:Charly Records artists]]"}]}}}}
