They established a devoted fan base in New England. In 1974, they performed with [[Count Basie]], and a few years later songwriter [[Doc Pomus]] helped them land their first record deal, and produced their debut with co-producer Joel Dorn. In 1977, Roomful of Blues\u2019 self-titled debut album on [[Island Records]] (reissued on Hyena Records as ''The First Album'') brought them to national attention.\n\nFounding member [[Duke Robillard]] left the band in 1980, and [[guitarist]] [[Ronnie Earl]] replaced him. Singer [[Lou Ann Barton]] joined the band at this time, sharing vocals with sax man Greg Piccolo.<ref name=AMG>Huey, Steve.

Roomful recorded the ''Hot Little Mama'' for their own Blue Flame label and two successful albums for the Varrick label during the 1980s. In 1994, they released ''Dance All Night'', their first featuring guitarist Chris Vachon (who joined the band in 1990) and harpist/vocalist [[Sugar Ray Norcia]]. Their 1995 album, the [[Grammy]]-nominated ''Turn It On! Turn It Up!'', a mix of big band swing and rock and  roll, brought the band its greatest radio and sales success to date. Roomful of Blues joined [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]]-based [[Alligator Records]] with the [[Grammy]]-nominated ''That\u2019s Right!'' in 2003, followed by ''Standing Room Only'' in 2005 and ''Raisin\u2019 A Ruckus'' in 2008.<ref name=AMG /> ''Down Beat'' described ''Standing Room Only'' as \u201cbold, brassy and highly danceable jump blues with contemporary energy and sophistication...swings with a vengeance.\u201d<ref name=DB>Hadley, Frank John.
