His birth date has been given as July 4, July 10, and July 23, 1908, 1909, or 1910. He died on January 21, 1992.\n\n==Biography==\nChampion Jack Dupree was a [[New Orleans blues]] and [[boogie woogie]] pianist, a [[Juke joint|barrelhouse]] \"professor\".  His father was from the [[Belgian Congo]] and his mother was part [[African American]] and [[Cherokee]].  He was orphaned at the age of two, and sent to the New Orleans Home for Colored Waifs, the alma mater of [[Louis Armstrong]].\n\nHe taught himself piano there and later apprenticed with [[Tuts Washington]] and [[Willie Hall (pianist)|Willie Hall]],<ref>[http://books.google.es/books?id=ed2TF84G-t8C&pg=PA130&lpg=PA130&dq=%22Drive'em+Down%22+piano&source=bl&ots=ym5VEzlntN&sig=0hYcp1eDzWYRwbrUefHX-y7RNH4&hl=es&ei=eZqTS5ONKdTX4gbIj9iBDQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=4&ved=0CA8Q6AEwAzgU#v=onepage&q=%22Drive'em%20Down%22%20piano&f=false Lichtenstein, Grace and Dankner, Laura ''Musical gumbo: the music of New Orleans'' W.W.

He was also \"spy boy\" for the Yellow Pochahantas tribe of [[Mardi Gras Indians]] and soon began playing in barrelhouses and other drinking establishments.\n\nHe began a life of travelling, living in [[Chicago]], where he worked with [[Thomas A. Dorsey|Georgia Tom]], and in [[Indianapolis, Indiana]] where he met [[Scrapper Blackwell]] and [[Leroy Carr]].  While always playing piano he also worked as a cook. In [[Detroit]], after [[Joe Louis]] encouraged him to become a boxer, he fought in 107 bouts, winning [[Golden Gloves]] and other championships and picking up the nickname 'Champion Jack', which he used the rest of his life.\n\nHe returned to Chicago at the age of 30 and joined a circle of recording artists, including [[Big Bill Broonzy]] and [[Tampa Red]], who introduced him to the record producer [[Lester Melrose]], who claimed composer credit and publishing on many of Dupree's songs.  Dupree's career was interrupted by military service in [[World War II]]. He was a cook in the [[United States Navy]] and spent two years as a Japanese prisoner of war.\n\nAfterwards his biggest commercial success was \"Walkin' the Blues\", which he recorded as a duet with [[Teddy McRae]]. This led to several national tours, and eventually to a European tour.\n\nDupree moved to Europe in 1960, first settling in [[Switzerland]] and then [[Denmark]], [[England]], [[Sweden]] and, finally, Germany.<ref name=\"russell\"/>  During the 1970s and 1980s he lived at [[Ovenden]] in [[Halifax, England]]<ref>http://www.smalltownsaturdaynight.co.uk Small Town Saturday Night</ref> and a piano used by Dupree was later re-discovered at [[Calderdale College]] in Halifax.<ref>[http://www.sounduk.net/file.php?fid=7 \"Matthew Bourne presents Songs from a Lost Piano\" at sounduk.net]</ref> Dupree continued to record in Europe with Kenn Lending Band, [[Louisiana Red]] and [[Axel Zwingenberger]] and made many live appearances, still working as a cook specializing in [[Louisiana Creole cuisine|New Orleans cuisine]]. He returned to the United States from time to time and appeared at the [[New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival]].\n\nDupree died of cancer on January 21, 1992 in [[Hanover]], [[Germany]].\n\n== Musical style and output ==\nDupree's playing was almost all straight blues and [[boogie-woogie]].  He was not a sophisticated musician or singer, but he had a wry and clever way with words: \"Mama, move your false teeth, papa wanna scratch your gums.\" He sometimes sang as if he had a [[cleft palate]] and even recorded under the name '''Harelip Jack Dupree'''.  This was an artistic conceit, as Dupree had excellent, clear articulation, particularly for a blues singer. Dupree would occasionally indulge in a [[vocalese]] style of sung [[word play]], similar to [[Slim Gaillard]]'s \"Vout\", as in his \"Mr. Dupree Blues\" included on ''The Complete Blue Horizon Sessions'' album.\n\nHe sang about life, jail, drinking and drug addiction; although he himself was a light drinker and did not use other drugs.  His \"Junker's Blues\" was also transmogrified by [[Fats Domino]] into his first hit, \"[[The Fat Man (song)|The Fat Man]]\".<ref name=\"russell\">{{cite book\n| first= Tony\n| last= Russell\n| year= 1997\n| title= The Blues - From [[Robert Johnson (musician)|Robert Johnson]] to [[Robert Cray]]\n| edition=\n| publisher=Carlton Books Limited\n| location= Dubai\n| pages= 107\u2013108\n| isbn= 1-85868-255-X}}</ref>  Dupree's songs included not only gloomy topics, such as \"[[Tuberculosis|TB]] Blues\" and \"Angola Blues\" (about [[Angola Prison]], the infamous Louisiana prison farm), but also cheerful subjects like the \"Dupree Shake Dance\": \"Come on, mama, on your hands and knees, do that shake dance as you please\".\n\nOn his best known album, ''[[Blues from the Gutter]]'' for [[Atlantic Records|Atlantic]], in 1959 he was accompanied on guitar by [[Larry Dale]], whose playing on that record inspired [[Brian Jones]] of [[The Rolling Stones]]. Dupree was also noted as a raconteur and transformed many of his stories into songs.  \"Big Leg Emma's\" takes its place in the roots of [[rap music]] as the rhymed tale of a police raid on a barrelhouse. In later years he recorded with [[John Mayall]], [[Mick Taylor]], [[Eric Clapton]] and [[The Band]].<ref name=\"russell\"/>\n\nAlthough [[Jerry Lee Lewis]] did not record Dupree's \"Shake Baby Shake\", the lyrics in his version of \"[[Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin' On]]\" - \"You can shake it one time for me!\" - echo Dupree's song.\n\nAlthough best known as a singer and pianist in the New Orleans style, Dupree occasionally pursued more musically adventurous projects, including Dupree `n` McPhee, a collaboration with English guitarist [[Tony McPhee]], recorded for [[Blue Horizon Records]].\n\n==Quotations==\n*\"When you open up a piano, you see freedom.  Nobody can play the white keys and don't play the black keys.  You got to mix all these keys together to make harmony.  And that's what the whole world needs: Harmony.\"\n\n*\"I'd rather have that piano than a wife. 'Cause that piano ain't goin' to leave me.\"<ref name=\"russell\"/>\n\n*\"Nasty Boogie Woogie\" by Jack Dupree\n:\"Mama bought a chicken, she took him for a duck\n:Laid him on the table with his legs stuck up\n:Yonder come the children with a spoon and a glass\n:Catch the gravy droppin' from his yes, yes, yes\"\n\n*\"Death of [[Martin Luther King]]\", recorded just after his assassination\n:\"I know you people, I know you glad you ain't one of me\n:I know you people glad, I know you glad you white and free\n:Oh yeah, white and free, oh, what will, what will become of me?\n:Oh I am begging, yes, I'm begging to be free\"\n\n*\"[I] found England was a heavenly place for me. I don't care who else find it difficult, but to me it's heaven. When you leave from slavery and go into a place where you're free... I couldn't go back there, because anybody that spit on me, I'd kill them.\"<ref name=\"blues britannia\">''[[Blues Britannia: Can Blue Men Sing the Whites?]]'' [[BBC Four]], 2009.</ref>\n\n==Discography==\n\n===Original 10\" shellac (78rpm) and 7\" vinyl (45rpm) releases===\n\n*OKeh 05656 Warehouse Man Blues/Chain Gang Blues (1940)\n*OKeh 05713 Black Woman Swing/Cabbage Greens (No. 1) (1940) \n*OKeh 05769 Gamblin' Man Blues/New Low Down Dog (1940)\n*OKeh 05823 Cabbage Greens (No. 2)/Angola Blues (1940)\n*OKeh 06068 My Baby's Gone/That's All Right (1941)\n*OKeh 06104 Dupree Shake Dance/Gibing Blues (1941)\n*OKeh 06152 Junker Blues/My Cabin Inn (1941)\n*OKeh 06197 Weed Head Woman/Bad Health Blues (1941)\n*OKeh 06597 Big Time Mama/Heavy Heart Blues (1941/rel. 1942)\n*OKeh 06642 All Alone Blues/Black Cow Blues (1941/rel. 1942)\n*Joe Davis 5100 She Makes Good Jelly/Rum Cola Blues (1945)\n*Joe Davis 5101 Johnson Street Boogie Woogie/I'm Going Down With You (1945)\n*Joe Davis 5102 F.D.R.
