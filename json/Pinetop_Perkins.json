He [[sound recording and reproduction|recorded]] \"Pinetop's Boogie Woogie\" (written by [[Pinetop Smith]]) at [[Sam Phillips]]' studio in [[Memphis, Tennessee]]. (\"They used to call me Pinetop,\" he recalled, \"because I played that song.\")<ref>[http://www.nea.gov/honors/heritage/Heritage00/Perkins.html Joe Willie \"Pinetop\" Perkins], 2000 [[National Endowment for the Arts|NEA]] [[National Heritage Fellowship]]s</ref> However, Perkins was only 15 years old in 1928, when Smith originally recorded \"Pinetop's Boogie Woogie\".\n\nPerkins then relocated to [[Illinois]] and left the music business until Hooker convinced him to record again in 1968. Perkins replaced [[Otis Spann]] when he left the [[Muddy Waters]] band in 1969.<ref name=\"russell\"/> After ten years with that organization, he formed [[The Legendary Blues Band]] with [[Willie \"Big Eyes\" Smith]], recording through the late 1970s, 1980s and early 1990s.<ref name=\"russell\"/>\n\n===Later career===\nPerkins played a brief musical cameo on the street outside Aretha's Soul Food Cafe in the 1980 movie ''[[The Blues Brothers (film)|The Blues Brothers]]'', having an argument with [[John Lee Hooker]] over who wrote \"[[Boom Boom (John Lee Hooker song)|Boom Boom]].\" He also appeared in the 1987 movie ''[[Angel Heart]]'' as a member of guitarist Toots Sweet's band.\n\nAlthough he appeared as a [[sideman]] on countless recordings, Perkins never had an album devoted solely to his artistry, until the release of ''[[After Hours (Pintop Perkins album)|After Hours]]'' on [[Blind Pig Records]] in 1988.<ref>{{cite web|author=Blind Pig Records |url=http://www.blindpigrecords.com/index.cfm?section=artists&artistid=44 |title=Blind Pig Records |publisher=Blind Pig Records |date= |accessdate=2011-03-22}}</ref> The tour in support of the album also featured [[Jimmy Rogers]] and guitarist [[Hubert Sumlin]]. In 1998 Perkins released the [[album]] ''Legends'' featuring Sumlin.\n\nPerkins was driving his automobile in 2004 in [[La Porte, Indiana]] when he was hit by a train. The car was wrecked but the 91-year-old driver was not seriously hurt. Until his death, Perkins lived in [[Austin, Texas]]. He usually performed a couple of nights a week at Nuno's on Sixth Street. In 2005, Perkins received the [[Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award]].\n\nIn 2008, Perkins received a [[Grammy Award for Best Traditional Blues Album]] for ''[[Last of the Great Mississippi Delta Bluesmen: Live In Dallas]]'' together with [[Henry Townsend (musician)|Henry James Townsend]], [[Robert Lockwood, Jr.]] and [[David Honeyboy Edwards]]. He was also [[nominate]]d in the same category for his solo album, ''Pinetop Perkins on the 88's: Live in Chicago''.\n\nThe song \"Hey Mr. Pinetop Perkins\", performed by Perkins and [[Angela Strehli]], played on the common misconception that Perkins wrote \"Pinetop's Boogie Woogie\":\n::''Hey Mr. Pinetop Perkins''\n::''I got a question for you''\n::''How'd you write that first boogie woogie''\n::''The one they named after you''\n\n===Oldest-ever Grammy winner===\nAt the age of 97, he won a [[Grammy Award]] for [[Best Traditional Blues Album]] for ''Joined at the Hip'', an album he recorded with [[Willie \"Big Eyes\" Smith]].
