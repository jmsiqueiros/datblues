His best known work included \"Keep Your Hands Off Her\" and \"All Night Long\".<ref name=\"Dead\"/> [[Music journalism|Music journalist]] Tony Russell stated \"his raw, repetitive style suggests an archaic forebear of [[John Lee Hooker]], a character his music shares with that of fellow North Mississippian [[R. L. Burnside]]\".<ref name=\"russell\"/>\n\n==Overview==\nJunior Kimbrough was born in [[Hudsonville, Mississippi]],<ref name=\"Dead\"/> and lived in the North Mississippi Hill Country near [[Holly Springs, Mississippi|Holly Springs]]. He recorded for the [[Fat Possum Records]] [[record label|label]].  He was a long-time associate of labelmate [[R. L. Burnside]], and the Burnside and Kimbrough families often collaborated on musical projects.  This relationship continues today. [[Rockabilly]] musician and friend [[Charlie Feathers]] called Kimbrough \"the beginning and end of all music.\" This is written on Kimbrough's tombstone outside his family's church, the Kimbrough Chapel Missionary Baptist Church near Holly Springs.\n\nBeginning around 1992, Kimbrough operated a [[juke joint]] known as \"Junior's Place\" in [[Chulahoma, Mississippi|Chulahoma]], Mississippi, which attracted visitors from around the world, including members of [[U2 (band)|U2]], [[Keith Richards]], and [[Iggy Pop]].  Kimbrough's sons, musicians Kinney and David Malone Kimbrough, kept it open following his death, until it burned to the ground on April 6, 2000.\n\nJunior Kimbrough died of a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] in 1998 in Holly Springs following a [[stroke]], at the age of 67.<ref name=\"Dead\">[http://thedeadrockstarsclub.com/1998.html Thedeadrockstarsclub.com] - accessed November 2009</ref> According to his artist bio on the Fat Possum Records website, he is survived by his claimed 36 children.\n\n==Music==\nKimbrough began playing [[guitar]] in his youth, and counted [[Lightnin' Hopkins]] as an early influence. In the late 1950s he began playing in his own style, which made use of mid-tempo rhythms and a steady [[Drone (music)|drone]] he played with his thumb on the bass strings of his guitar. This style would later be cited as a prime example of regional [[north hill country blues]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hillcountryharmonica.com/hillcountryblues.html |title=Mississippi hill country blues: an introduction &#124; R.L. Burnside - Junior Kimbrough - Mississippi Fred McDowell - Jessie Mae Hemphill - North Mississippi Allstars |publisher=Hillcountryharmonica.com |date= |accessdate=2011-12-31}}</ref> His music is characterized by the tricky [[syncopation]]s between his droning bass strings and his mid-range melodies. His soloing style has been described as [[modal jazz|modal]] and features languorous runs in the mid and upper register. The result was described by music critic [[Robert Palmer (author/producer)|Robert Palmer]] as \"hypnotic\". In solo and ensemble settings it is often polyrhythmic, which links it explicitly to the music of [[Africa]]. Fellow North Mississippi bluesman and former Kimbrough bassist Eric Deaton has suggested similarities between Junior Kimbrough's music and [[Mali]]an bluesman [[Ali Farka Tour\u00e9]]'s.\n\n==Career==\nIn 1966 Kimbrough traveled to [[Memphis, Tennessee]] from his home in North Mississippi and recorded for the [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]]/[[Gospel music|gospel]] producer and owner of the Goldwax record label, [[Quinton Claunch]]. Claunch was a founder of Hi Records (whose entire catalog will be reissued by Fat Possum) and is known as the man that gave [[James Carr (musician)|James Carr]] and [[O.V. Wright]] their start. Kimbrough recorded one session in one afternoon at American Studios. Claunch declined to release the recordings, deeming them too [[Country music|country]]. Forty some years later, Bruce Watson of Big Legal Mess Records approached Claunch to buy the original master tapes and the rights to release the recordings made that day. These songs were released by Big Legal Mess Records in 2009 as ''First Recordings''. Kimbrough's debut release was a [[cover version]] of [[Lowell Fulson]]'s \"Tramp\" released as a [[single (music)|single]] on independent label Philwood in 1967. On the label of the record Kimbrough's name was spelled incorrectly as Junior Kimbell and the song \"Tramp\" was listed as \"Tram?\" The [[A-side and B-side|b-side]] was \"You Can't Leave Me\".\n\nAmong his other early recordings are two [[duet (music)|duets]] with his childhood friend [[Charlie Feathers]] in 1969. Feathers counted Kimbrough as an early influence and Kimbrough gave Feathers some of his earliest lessons on guitar.\n\nKimbrough recorded very little in the 1970s, contributing an early version of \"Meet Me in the City\" to a European blues anthology. With his band, the Soul Blues Boys, Kimbrough recorded again in the 1980s, releasing a single in 1982 (\"Keep Your Hands Off Her\" b/w \"I Feel Good, Little Girl\"). The [[High Water Recording Company|High Water]] label recorded a 1988 session with Kimbrough and the Soul Blues Boys, releasing it in 1997 with his 1982 single as \"Do The Rump\".\n\nKimbrough came to national attention in 1992 with his debut album, ''[[All Night Long (Junior Kimbrough album)|All Night Long]]''.<ref name=\"russell\">{{cite book\n| first= Tony\n| last= Russell\n| year= 1997\n| title= The Blues - From [[Robert Johnson (musician)|Robert Johnson]] to [[Robert Cray]]\n| edition= \n| publisher=Carlton Books Limited \n| location= Dubai\n| pages= 130\u2013131\n| isbn= 1-85868-255-X}}</ref> [[Robert Palmer (author/producer)|Robert Palmer]] [[record producer|produced]] the album for Fat Possum Records, recording it in a local [[church (building)|church]] with Junior's son Kent \"Kinney\" Kimbrough (aka Kenny Malone) on [[drum kit|drums]] and R. L. Burnside's son Garry Burnside on [[bass guitar]]. The album featured many of his most celebrated songs, including the title track, the complexly melodic \"Meet Me In The City,\" and \"You Better Run\" a harrowing ballad of attempted rape. ''All Night Long'' earned near-unanimous praise from [[music journalism|critics]], receiving four stars in ''[[Rolling Stone]]''. His stock continued to rise the following year after live footage of him playing \"All Night Long\" in one of his juke joints appeared in the [[Robert Mugge]] directed, Robert Palmer narrated [[film documentary]], ''[[Deep Blues: A Musical Pilgrimage to the Crossroads]]''. This performance was actually recorded earlier in 1990.\n\nA second album for Fat Possum, ''[[Sad Days, Lonely Nights]]'', followed in 1994. A [[music video|video]] for the album's title track featured Kimbrough, Garry Burnside and Kent Kimbrough playing in Kimbrough's juke joint. The last album he would record, ''Most Things Haven't Worked Out'', appeared on Fat Possum in 1997. Following his death in 1998 in Holly Springs, Fat Possum released two posthumous [[compilation album]]s of material Kimbrough recorded in the 1990s, ''God Knows I Tried'' (1998) and ''Meet Me in The City'' (1999). A greatest hits compilation, ''You Better Run: The Essential Junior Kimbrough'', followed in 2002. Fat Possum also released a tribute album, ''[[Sunday Nights: The Songs of Junior Kimbrough]]'', in 2005, which featured [[Iggy & The Stooges]] (Kimbrough once toured with frontman [[Iggy Pop]]), [[The Black Keys]] and [[Mark Lanegan]].  The Black Keys have released an album composed entirely of covers of Junior's music, [[Chulahoma: The Songs of Junior Kimbrough|Chulahoma]]. [[Richard Johnston (musician)|Richard Johnston]], a Kimbrough prot\u00e9g\u00e9, keeps this musical tradition alive with one of Junior's sons, via live performances on [[Beale Street]] in Memphis.\n\n==Album discography==\n* ''First Recordings'' (recorded in 1966, released in 2009)\n* ''[[All Night Long (Junior Kimbrough album)|All Night Long]]'' (1992)\n* ''[[Sad Days, Lonely Nights]]'' (1993)\n* ''Do The Rump'' (1997)\n* ''Most Things Haven't Worked Out'' (1997)\n* ''God Knows I Tried'' (1998)\n* ''Meet Me in the City'' (1999)\n* ''You Better Run: The Essential Junior Kimbrough'' (2002)\n\n==Tribute albums==\n* ''[[Sunday Nights: The Songs of Junior Kimbrough]]''\n* ''[[The Black Keys]] - [[Chulahoma: The Songs of Junior Kimbrough]]'' (Songs written by Kimbrough and  performed by [[The Black Keys]])\n\n==Films==\n*''[[Deep Blues: A Musical Pilgrimage to the Crossroads]]'' (1992)\n*''You See Me Laughin': The Last of the Hill Country Bluesmen'' (2003) - released by Fat Possum Records in 2005\n\n==See also==\n* [[Robert Belfour]]\n* [[RL Burnside]]\n* [[T-Model Ford]]\n* [[Mississippi Fred McDowell]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n*William Barlow (1993) \"Cashing In\".
