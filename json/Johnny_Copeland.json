Influenced by [[T-Bone Walker]], he formed the 'Dukes of Rhythm' in [[Houston]], [[Texas]], and made his [[sound recording and reproduction|recording]] debut in 1956, signing with [[Duke Records]] the following year. Although his early [[gramophone record|records]] met with little commercial success, he became a popular touring act over the next two decades.\n\nHis early recording career embraced blues, soul and rock and roll. He cut [[Single (music)|singles]] for Mercury, Golden Eagle and All Boy, amongst  others. His first single was \"Rock 'n' Roll Lily\",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.amazon.com/Rock-n-Roll-Lily/dp/B0010VGUUW |title=Rock 'n' Roll Lily: Johnny Copeland: MP3 Downloads |publisher=Amazon.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-08}}</ref> and he later cut successes such as \"Down On Bending Knees\" and \"Please Let Me Know\". For the most part, his singles featured Copeland as a vocalist more than a guitar player. \n\nDriven by [[disco]] to rethink his future, he moved to New York in 1979,<ref name=\"russell\">{{cite book\n| first= Tony\n| last= Russell\n| year= 1997\n| title= The Blues - From [[Robert Johnson (musician)|Robert Johnson]] to [[Robert Cray]]\n| edition= \n| publisher=Carlton Books Limited \n| location= Dubai\n| isbn= 1-85868-255-X\n| page= 182}}</ref> and played extensively in the eastern cities.  In 1981, he was signed by [[Rounder Records]], releasing [[album]]s including ''Copeland Special'' (1981) and ''Bringing It All Back Home'' (1985), and touring widely. Copeland appeared at the 1983 [[Long Beach Blues Festival]], and the 1988 [[San Francisco Blues Festival]]. He won a [[Grammy Award|Grammy]] in [[Grammy Awards of 1987|1987]] for [[Grammy Award for Best Traditional Blues Album|best traditional blues album]] for the album ''[[Showdown!]]'', recorded with [[Albert Collins]] and [[Robert Cray]].\n\nCopeland also played at the 1985 [[Montreux Jazz Festival]], as a guest with [[Stevie Ray Vaughan]] and Double Trouble. Vaughan and Copeland  performed the [[Bob Geddins]] song, \"Tin Pan Alley\" together on Vaughan's ''Blues At Sunrise'' [[compilation album]]. He also played on the first edition of BRBF (Blues Peer Festival) later that year.\n\nHis later years were dogged by ill health due to a congenital heart defect.  He died, aged 60, in [[Harlem]], [[New York City|New York]], from complications of heart surgery for a [[Heart transplantation|heart transplanted]] six months earlier.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://users.efortress.com/doc-rock/1996.html |title=eFortress.com |publisher=Users.efortress.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-08}}</ref> \n\nCopeland was a resident of [[Teaneck, New Jersey|Teaneck]], [[New Jersey]].<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A0CE2D61330F937A35754C0A961958260 |title=Johnny Copeland, 60, Who Sang Texas Blues and Played Guitar |publisher=New York Times |date=1997-07-04 |accessdate=2013-03-08}}</ref> His daughter, [[Shemekia Copeland]], established a successful career as a singer.
