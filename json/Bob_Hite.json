His nickname was \"The Bear\".\n\n==Biography==\nHite was introduced to [[Alan Wilson (musician)|Alan Wilson]] by [[Henry Vestine]] and the two of them helped convince blues [[pianist]] [[Sunnyland Slim]]  (1906-1995) to get back into the [[recording studio]] to [[sound recording and reproduction|record]]. In 1965, aged 22, he formed a band with Wilson. Vestine joined soon after and this trio formed the core of Canned Heat. The trio were eventually joined by [[Larry Taylor]] ([[bassist|bass]]) and Frank Cook ([[drum]]s).\n\nCanned Heat appeared on a November 1969 episode of ''[[Playboy After Dark]]''. Hite was invited to talk with [[Hugh Hefner]]  after the performance, along with other guests [[Sonny and Cher]], [[Vic Damone]], [[Dick Shawn]] and [[Larry Storch]]. A 20-year-old [[Lindsay Wagner]], playing the part of one of Hefner's party guests, sat on Hite's lap and played a party game. When asked by Hefner what kind of animal Hite would be if he were an animal, Wagner claimed he'd be a bear. Hite told her she got it right, that people called him \"The Bear.\" It was also on this episode that Bob Hite informed Hugh Hefner that he had over 15,000 78s.<ref>[http://www.tv.com/playboy-after-dark/sonny-and-cher-vic-damone-canned-heat-larry-storch-dick-shawn/episode/359273/summary.html TV.com]</ref>\n\nHite performed with Canned Heat at [[Woodstock]] in August 1969. The performances were not included in the original (1970) film ''[[Woodstock (film)|Woodstock]]'', but are in the 1994 \"Director's Cut\" version.\n\nHe [[record producer|produced]] the [[John Lee Hooker]]/Canned Heat album, ''[[Hooker 'N Heat]]'' (1971).\n\n===Death===\nOn April 5, 1981, during a break between sets at [[Palomino Club (North Hollywood)|The Palomino Club]] in [[North Hollywood]], Hite was handed a drug vial by a fan.  Thinking it contained [[cocaine]], Hite stuck a straw into the vial and snorted it. The drug turned out to be [[heroin]] and Hite turned blue and collapsed. Some roadies put Hite in the band's van, and drove him to a nearby home where he died of an overdose.<ref>Kulczyk, David. (2009).
