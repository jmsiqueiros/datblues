He is best known for his accompaniment on [[gramophone record|record]] of both [[Barbecue Bob]] and [[Curley Weaver]].\n\n==Biography==\nMapp was born in [[Social Circle, Georgia|Social Circle]], [[Walton County, Georgia|Walton County]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. He relocated in 1922 to [[Newton County, Georgia|Newton County]], where he met the [[guitar]] player, [[Curley Weaver]]. Although he did not sing,  Mapp was noted in Newton County as a harmonica virtuoso with a unique style, who often performed for tips on the street. In 1925 Weaver and Mapp left for [[Atlanta, Georgia|Atlanta]].<ref name=\"Blind\"/>  The twosome played at country dances, then Weaver together with [[Barbecue Bob]] and his brother [[Charley Lincoln|Charlie Hicks]] formed a group with Mapp, and continued to play locally.<ref name=\"russell\">{{cite book\n| first= Tony\n| last= Russell\n| year= 1997\n| title= The Blues - From [[Robert Johnson (musician)|Robert Johnson]] to [[Robert Cray]]\n| edition= \n| publisher=Carlton Books Limited \n| location= Dubai\n| page= 182\n| isbn= 1-85868-255-X}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thebluestrail.com/artists/mus_bh.htm |title=Barbeque Bob HICKS |publisher=Thebluestrail.com |date= |accessdate=2014-01-26}}</ref> \n\nIn 1929, and billed as the Georgia Cotton Pickers, they recorded for the Atlanta based QRS [[record label|label]].
