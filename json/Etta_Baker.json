Baker played the Piedmont Blues for ninety years, starting at the age of three when she could not even hold the guitar properly.  She was taught by her father, Boone Reid, who was also a longtime player of the Piedmont Blues on several instruments.  Etta Baker was first recorded in the summer of 1956 when she and her father happened across folk singer [[Paul Clayton (folksinger)|Paul Clayton]] while visiting Cone Mansion in [[Blowing Rock, North Carolina]], near their home in Morganton, NC.  Baker's father asked Clayton to listen to his daughter playing her signature \"One Dime Blues\".  Clayton was impressed and arrived at the Baker house with his tape recorder the next day, recording several songs.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Coltman|first1=Bob|title=Paul Clayton and the Folksong Revival|publisher=Scarecrow Press|year=2008|location=Lanham, Maryland|pages=297|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=UAn-54_ogxcC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false|accessdate=2011-02-12|isbn=0-8108-6132-1}}</ref>\n\nOver the years, Baker has shared her knowledge with many well known musical artists including [[Bob Dylan]], [[Taj Mahal (musician)|Taj Mahal]], and [[Kenny Wayne Shepherd]].
