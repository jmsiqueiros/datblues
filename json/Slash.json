The following September, Guns N' Roses released the long-awaited albums ''[[Use Your Illusion I]]'' and ''[[Use Your Illusion II]]'', which debuted at No. 2 and No. 1, respectively, on the [[Billboard 200|U.S. chart]], a feat not achieved by any other group.<ref name=\"Sugerman91\">{{cite book | last = Sugerman | first = Danny | title = Appetite for Destruction: The Days of Guns N' Roses | publisher=St. Martin's Press | year = 1991 | isbn = 0-312-07634-7}}</ref> Izzy Stradlin abruptly left the band in November; he was replaced by [[Gilby Clarke]] of [[Candy (band)|Candy]] and Kill for Thrills. Slash played his final show with Guns N' Roses on July 17, 1993.<ref name=\"HTGTH\"/> In November of that year, the band released ''[[\"The Spaghetti Incident?\"]]'', a cover album of mostly [[punk rock|punk]] songs, which proved less successful than its predecessors. Slash then wrote several songs for what would have become the follow-up album to the ''Use Your Illusion'' twins. Axl Rose and Duff, however, rejected the material.\n\nAfter three years of inactivity, Slash announced in October 1996 that he was no longer a part of Guns N' Roses.<ref name=\"HTGTH\"/> In his 2007 autobiography, Slash states that his decision to leave the band was not based, as widely believed, on artistic differences with Axl Rose, but on the following three reasons: the disrespect shown by Rose to their audiences and crew by causing the band to almost always take the stage late during the Use Your Illusion Tour; the legal manipulation that Rose forced on his band mates by demanding ownership of the band name and downgrading them contractually to hired hands; and the departures of Steven Adler and Izzy Stradlin.<ref>{{harvnb|Slash|Bozza|2008|p=454}}</ref>\n\n=== 1994\u20132002: Slash's Snakepit ===\n{{Main|Slash's Snakepit}}\nIn 1994, Slash formed Slash's Snakepit, a side project that featured his Guns N' Roses band mates Matt Sorum and Gilby Clarke on drums and rhythm guitar respectively, as well as [[Alice in Chains]]' [[Mike Inez]] on bass and [[Jellyfish (band)|Jellyfish]]'s [[Eric Dover]] on vocals. The band recorded Slash's material originally intended for Guns N' Roses, resulting in the release of ''[[It's Five O'Clock Somewhere (album)|It's Five O'Clock Somewhere]]'' in February 1995. The album was critically praised for ignoring the then-popular conventions of [[alternative music]], and fared well on the charts, eventually selling over one million copies in the US alone despite little promotion from Geffen Records. Slash's Snakepit toured in support of the album with bassist [[James LoMenzo]] and drummer [[Brian Tichy]] of [[Pride and Glory (band)|Pride and Glory]], before disbanding in 1996. Slash then toured for two years with the [[blues rock]] cover band [[Slash's Blues Ball]].\n\nIn 1999, Slash chose to regroup Slash's Snakepit with [[Rod Jackson]] on vocals, [[Ryan Roxie]] on rhythm guitar, [[Johnny Griparic]] on bass, and [[Matt Laug]] on drums. Their second album, ''[[Ain't Life Grand (Slash's Snakepit album)|Ain't Life Grand]]'', was released in October 2000 through [[E1 Music|Koch Records]]. It did not sell as well as the band's previous release, and its critical reception was mixed. To promote the album, the band\u2014with [[Keri Kelli]] on rhythm guitar\u2014embarked on an extensive world tour in support of [[AC/DC]] in the summer of 2000, followed by their own headlining theater tour. Slash disbanded Snakepit in 2002.\n\n=== 2002\u20132008: Velvet Revolver ===\n{{Main|Velvet Revolver}}\n[[File:SaulHudson.jpg|thumb|right|Slash during a [[Velvet Revolver]] concert in [[Nijmegen]] in 2005]]\n\nIn 2002, Slash reunited with Duff McKagan and Matt Sorum for a [[Randy Castillo]] tribute concert. Realizing that they still had the chemistry of their days in Guns N' Roses, they decided to form a new band together. Former Guns N' Roses guitarist Izzy Stradlin was initially involved, but left after the others decided to find a lead singer. [[Dave Kushner]], who had previously played with McKagan in [[Loaded (band)|Loaded]], then joined the band on rhythm guitar. For many months, the four searched for a lead singer by listening to offered demo tapes, a monotonous process documented by [[VH1]]. Eventually, former [[Stone Temple Pilots]] vocalist [[Scott Weiland]] joined the band.\n\nIn 2003, Velvet Revolver played several concerts during the summer and released their first single, \"[[Set Me Free (Velvet Revolver song)|Set Me Free]]\". In June 2004, they released their debut album, ''[[Contraband (Velvet Revolver album)|Contraband]]'', which debuted at No. 1 on the U.S. chart and sold two million copies, re-establishing Slash as a mainstream performer. A year-and-a-half-long tour followed in support of the album. In July 2007, Velvet Revolver released their second album, ''[[Libertad (Velvet Revolver album)|Libertad]]'', and embarked on a second tour.
