He attended Denbigh High School in Newport News, Virginia. By the age of twenty, Cray had seen his heroes [[Albert Collins]], [[Freddie King]] and [[Muddy Waters]] in concert and decided to form his own band; they began playing college towns on the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]].<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/> In the late 1970s he lived in [[Eugene, Oregon]], where he formed the Robert Cray Band and collaborated with [[Curtis Salgado]] in the Cray-Hawks. In the 1978 film ''[[Animal House|National Lampoon's Animal House]]'', Cray was the uncredited bassist in the house party band [[Otis Day and the Knights]].<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/> After several years of regional success, Cray was signed to [[Mercury Records]] in 1982. Two albums on [[HighTone Records]] in the mid-1980s, ''[[Bad Influence (Robert Cray album)|Bad Influence]]'' and ''[[False Accusations]]'', were moderately successful in the United States and in Europe, where he was building a reputation as a live artist.<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/> His fourth album release, ''[[Strong Persuader]]'', produced by Dennis Walker, received a [[Grammy Award]], while the [[Crossover (music)|crossover]] [[single (music)|single]] \"Smokin' Gun\" gave him wider appeal and name recognition.<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/>\n\nHe was invited by [[Keith Richards]] to join the backing band for [[Chuck Berry]] in the 1987 film, Chuck Berry: [[Hail! Hail! Rock 'N' Roll]], directed by [[Taylor Hackford]].<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/>\n\nBy now, Cray was an opening act for such major stars as [[Eric Clapton]] (who remains a friend to this day) and sold out larger venues as a solo artist.<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/> Cray has generally played Fender guitars ([[Telecaster]]s and [[Stratocaster]]s) and there are two signature Robert Cray Stratocasters models available from Fender. The Robert Cray Custom Shop Stratocaster is made in the United States in the Fender custom shop and is identical to the guitars that Cray currently plays, while the [[Robert Cray Standard Stratocaster]] is a less-expensive model made in Fender's [[Ensenada, Baja California|Ensenada]], [[Mexico]] plant.\n\nCray had the opportunity to play alongside [[John Lee Hooker]] on his album ''Boom Boom'', playing the guitar solo in the song \"Same Old Blues Again\". He is also featured on the Hooker album, ''[[The Healer (album)|The Healer]]''; he plays a guitar solo on the song \"Baby Lee\".  The entire Robert Cray Band backs Hooker on the title track of Hooker's 1992 album ''Mr. Lucky'', where Cray plays lead guitar, sings, and banters with Hooker throughout the song.<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/>  \n\nCray was invited to play at the \"Guitar Legends\" concerts in [[Seville]], [[Spain]] at the 1992 [[Seville Expo '92|Expo]], where he played a signature track, \"Phone Booth\".<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/> [[Albert Collins]] was also on the bill on this blues night of the \"Legends\" gigs.\n\nCray continues to record and tour. He appeared at the [[Crossroads Guitar Festival]], and [[Opening act|supported]] Eric Clapton on his 2006-2007 world tour. In [[Fargo, North Dakota]], he joined Clapton on backup guitar for the [[Cream (band)|Cream]] song \"[[Cross Road Blues|Crossroads]]\". In 2011, Cray was inducted to the [[Blues Hall of Fame]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blues.org/halloffame/#ref=halloffame_inductees |title=Blues Hall of Fame inductees 2011 |publisher=Blues.org |date= |accessdate=2012-03-02}}</ref>\n\n==Robert Cray Band==\n[[File:The Robert Cray band.jpg|thumb|right|The Robert Cray Band]]\n*Robert Cray - guitar/singer\n*Les Falconer - [[Drum kit|drums]]\n*Jim Pugh - [[Keyboard instrument|keyboards]]\n*Richard Cousins - [[bass guitar]]\n\n==Discography==\n{{Main|Robert Cray discography}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of blues musicians]]\n*[[List of electric blues musicians]]\n*[[List of contemporary blues musicians]]\n*[[List of soul-blues musicians]]\n*[[List of guitarists]]\n*[[List of celebrities who have appeared on the cover of Rolling Stone magazine]]\n*[[Chicago Blues Festival]]\n*[[Long Beach Blues Festival]]\n*[[Crossroads Guitar Festival]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commonscat|Robert Cray}}\n{{Prone to spam|date=March 2012}}\n<!--======================== {{No more links}} ============================\n    | PLEASE BE CAUTIOUS IN ADDING MORE LINKS TO THIS ARTICLE.
