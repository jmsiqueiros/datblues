His career spanned over 50 years, leading his orchestra from 1923 until he died.\n\nThough widely considered to have been a pivotal figure in the history of jazz, Ellington himself embraced the phrase \"beyond category\" as a \"liberating principle\", and referred his music to the more general category of \"American Music\", rather than to a musical genre such as \"jazz\".<ref name=\"Tucker-1\">{{Harvnb|Tucker|1995|p=6}} writes \"He tried to avoid the word 'jazz' preferring 'Negro' or 'American' music. He claimed there were only two types of music, 'good' and 'bad' ... And he embraced a phrase coined by his colleague [[Billy Strayhorn]] \u2013 'beyond category' \u2013 as a liberating principle.\"</ref> Born in [[Washington, D.C.]], he was based in [[New York City]] from the mid-1920s, and gained a national profile through his orchestra's appearances at the [[Cotton Club]]. In the 1930s they toured in Europe.\n\nSome of the musicians who were members of Ellington's orchestra, such as saxophonist [[Johnny Hodges]], are still, in their own right, considered to be among the best players in jazz, but it was Ellington who melded them into the best-known [[orchestral jazz|jazz orchestral]] unit in the history of jazz. Several members of the orchestra remained members for several decades. A master at writing miniatures for the [[Gramophone record#78 rpm recording time|three-minute 78 rpm]] record format, Ellington often composed specifically for the style and skills of his individual musicians, such as \"Jeep's Blues\" for Hodges, and \"Concerto for Cootie\" for trumpeter [[Cootie Williams]], which later became \"[[Do Nothing Till You Hear from Me]]\" with [[Bob Russell (songwriter)|Bob Russell]]'s lyrics.\n\nOften collaborating with others, Ellington originated over a thousand compositions and his extensive oeuvre is the largest recorded personal jazz legacy, with many of his extant works having become [[Standard (music)|standards]].  Ellington also recorded songs written by his bandsmen, for example [[Juan Tizol]]'s \"[[Caravan (song)|Caravan]]\", and \"[[Perdido (song)|Perdido]]\", which brought ''[[Spanish tinge]]'' to [[Big band|big-band jazz]].\n\nAfter 1941, Ellington collaborated with composer-arranger-pianist [[Billy Strayhorn]], whom he called his \"writing and arranging companion\".<ref>Hajdu, David (1996), ''Lush Life: A Biography of Billy Strayhorn'', New York: Farrar, Straus & Giroux, ISBN 978-0-86547-512-0, p.170.</ref> With Strayhorn, he composed many extended compositions, or 'suites', as well as further shorter pieces. Following an appearance at the [[Newport Jazz Festival|Newport Jazz Festival, Rhode Island]] in July 1956, he enjoyed a major career revival and, with his orchestra, embarked on world tours. Ellington recorded for most American record companies of his era at some point, and appeared in several films, scoring several, and composed stage musicals.\n\nDue to his inventive use of the orchestra, or big-band, and thanks to his eloquence and charisma, he is generally considered to have elevated the perception of jazz to an art form on a par with other traditional genres of music. His reputation increased after his death and he was awarded a special [[Pulitzer Prize]] in 1999.<ref name=pulitzer/>\n\n[[Gunther Schuller]] wrote in 1989: \"Ellington composed incessantly to the very last days of his life. Music was indeed his mistress; it was his total life and his commitment to it was incomparable and unalterable. In jazz he was a giant among giants. And in twentieth century music, he may yet one day be recognized as one of the half-dozen greatest masters of our time.\"<ref>Schuller, Gunther, ''The Swing Era'', New York: Oxford University Press, 1989, ISBN 0-19-504312-X. p.157</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nEdward Kennedy \"Duke\" Ellington was born on April 29, 1899, to James Edward Ellington and Daisy Kennedy Ellington. Daisy and J.E. were both pianists. Daisy primarily played [[parlor song]]s and J.E. preferred operatic arias. They lived with his maternal grandparents at 2129 Ida Place (now Ward Place), NW in the [[West End, Washington, D.C.|West End]] neighborhood of  Washington, D.C.<ref name=\"Lawrence-1\">{{Harvnb|Lawrence|2001|p=1}}</ref> Duke's father was born in [[Lincolnton, North Carolina]], on April 15, 1879, and moved to Washington, D.C. in 1886 with his parents.<ref name=\"Lawrence-2\">{{Harvnb|Lawrence|2001|p=2}}.</ref> Daisy Kennedy was born in Washington, D.C. on January 4, 1879, and was the daughter of a former American [[slave]].<ref name=\"Lawrence-1\">{{Harvnb|Lawrence|2001|p=1}}.</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Hasse|1995|p=21}}.</ref> James Ellington made [[wikt:blueprint|blueprint]]s for the [[United States Navy]].\n\nAt the age of seven, Ellington began taking piano lessons from Marietta Clinkscales. Daisy surrounded her son with dignified women to reinforce his manners and teach him to live elegantly. Ellington\u2019s childhood friends noticed that \"his casual, offhand manner, his easy grace, and his dapper dress gave him the bearing of a young nobleman\",<ref name=\"Terkel\">{{Harvnb|Terkel|2002}}</ref> and began calling him Duke. Ellington credited his \"chum\" Edgar McEntree for the nickname. \"I think he felt that in order for me to be eligible for his constant companionship, I should have a title. So he called me Duke.\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Ellington|1976|p=20}}.</ref>\n\nThough Ellington took piano lessons, he was more interested in baseball. \"[[Teddy Roosevelt|President Roosevelt (Teddy)]] would come by on his horse sometimes, and stop and watch us play\", he recalled.<ref>{{Harvnb|Ellington|1976|p=10}}.</ref> Ellington went to Armstrong Technical High School in Washington, D.C. He got his first job selling peanuts at [[Minnesota Twins|Washington Senators]] baseball games.\n\nIn the summer of 1914, while working as a [[soda jerk]] at the [[Poodle Dog Cafe]], he wrote his first composition, \"Soda Fountain Rag\" (also known as the \"Poodle Dog Rag\"). Ellington created \"Soda Fountain Rag\" by ear, because he had not yet learned to read and write music. \"I would play the 'Soda Fountain Rag' as a one-step, two-step, waltz, tango, and fox trot\", Ellington recalled. \"Listeners never knew it was the same piece. I was established as having my own repertoire.\"<ref name=\"current\">\"Ellington, Duke\". Current Biography. H.W. Wilson Company, 1970.</ref> In his autobiography, ''Music is my Mistress'' (1973), Ellington wrote that he missed more lessons than he attended, feeling at the time that playing the piano was not his talent. Ellington started sneaking into Frank Holiday's Poolroom at the age of fourteen. Hearing the poolroom pianists play ignited Ellington's love for the instrument and he began to take his piano studies seriously. Among the many piano players he listened to were Doc Perry, Lester Dishman, Louis Brown, [[Turner Layton]], Gertie Wells, Clarence Bowser, Sticky Mack, Blind Johnny, [[Cliff Jackson]], [[Claude Hopkins]], Phil Wurd, Caroline Thornton, [[Luckey Roberts]], [[Eubie Blake]], Joe Rochester, and Harvey Brooks.<ref name=\"Music on My Mind\">{{cite book |last=Smith|first=Willie the Lion|title=Music on My Mind: The Memoirs of an American Pianist, Foreword by Duke Ellington|year=1964|pages=ix|publisher=Doubleday & Company Inc |location=New York City|isbn=}}</ref>\n\nEllington began listening to, watching, and imitating ragtime pianists, not only in Washington, D.C., but in [[Philadelphia]] and [[Atlantic City]], where he vacationed with his mother during the summer months.<ref name=\"current\"/> [[Dunbar High School (Washington, D.C.)|Dunbar High School]] music teacher Henry Lee Grant gave him private lessons in harmony. With the additional guidance of Washington pianist and band leader Oliver \"Doc\" Perry, Ellington learned to read [[sheet music]], project a professional style, and improve his technique. Ellington was also inspired by his first encounters with [[Stride (music)|stride pianists]] [[James P. Johnson]] and [[Luckey Roberts]]. Later in New York he took advice from [[Will Marion Cook]], [[Fats Waller]], and [[Sidney Bechet]]. Ellington started to play gigs in caf\u00e9s and clubs in and around Washington, D.C. and his attachment grew to be so strong that he turned down an art scholarship to the [[Pratt Institute]] in Brooklyn in 1916. Three months before graduating he dropped out of Armstrong Manual Training School, where he was studying commercial art.<ref name=\"simmonds\">{{cite news|url=http://www.lasentinel.net/Duke-Ellington.html|title=Duke Ellington|last=Simmonds|first=Yussuf|date=September 11, 2008|work=Los Angeles Sentinel|accessdate=July 14, 2009}}</ref>\n\nWorking as a freelance sign-painter from 1917, he began assembling groups to play for dances, and in 1919 met drummer [[Sonny Greer]] from New Jersey who encouraged Ellington's ambition to become a professional musician. Through his day job, Ellington's entrepreneurial side came out: when a customer would ask him to make a sign for a dance or party, he would ask them if they had musical entertainment; if not, Ellington would ask if he could play for them. He also had a messenger job with the U.S. Navy and State Departments. Ellington moved out of his parents' home and bought his own as he became a successful pianist. At first, he played in other ensembles, and in late 1917 formed his first group, \"The Duke's Serenaders\" (\"Colored Syncopators\", his telephone directory advertising proclaimed).<ref name=\"simmonds\"/> He was not only a member, but also the booking agent. His first play date was at the True Reformer's Hall, where he took home 75 cents.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hasse|1993|p=45}}.</ref>\n\nEllington played throughout the Washington, D.C. area and into Virginia for private society balls and embassy parties. The band included childhood friend [[Otto Hardwick]], who started on string bass, then moved to C-melody sax and finally settled on alto saxophone; [[Arthur Whetsol]] on trumpet; [[Elmer Snowden]] on banjo; and Sonny Greer on drums. The band thrived, performing for both African-American and white audiences, a rarity at the time.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Cohen|first=Harvey G.|date=Autumn 2004|title=The Marketing of Duke Ellington: Setting the Strategy for an African American Maestro|journal=The Journal of African-American History|publisher=Association for the Study of African-American Life and History, Inc.|volume=89|issue=4|pages=291\u2013315|jstor=4134056|doi=10.2307/4134056}}</ref>\n\n==Music career==\n[[File:Duke Ellington St. Louis Toodle-Oo.jpg|thumb|right|220 px|\"East St. Louis Toodle-Oo\" (1927)]]\n\n===Early career===\nWhen his drummer Sonny Greer was invited to join the [[Wilber Sweatman]] Orchestra in New York City, Ellington made the fateful decision to leave behind his successful career in Washington, D.C., and move to [[Harlem]], ultimately becoming part of the [[Harlem Renaissance]]. New dance crazes like the [[Charleston (dance)|Charleston]] emerged in Harlem, as well as African-American musical theater, including [[Eubie Blake]]'s ''[[Shuffle Along]]''. After the young musicians left the Sweatman Orchestra to strike out on their own, they found an emerging jazz scene that was highly competitive and hard to crack. They hustled pool by day and played whatever gigs they could find. The young band met stride pianist [[Willie \"The Lion\" Smith]] who introduced them to the scene and gave them some money. They played at [[Rent party|rent-house parties]] for income. After a few months, the young musicians returned to Washington, D.C., feeling discouraged.\n\nIn June 1923, a gig in [[Atlantic City, New Jersey]], led to a play date at the prestigious Exclusive Club in Harlem. This was followed in September 1923 by a move to the Hollywood Club \u2013 49th and Broadway \u2013 and a four-year engagement, which gave Ellington a solid artistic base. He was known to play the bugle at the end of each performance. The group was initially called Elmer Snowden and his Black Sox Orchestra and had seven members, including trumpeter [[James \"Bubber\" Miley]]. They renamed themselves \"The Washingtonians\". Snowden left the group in early 1924 and Ellington took over as bandleader. After a fire, the club was re-opened as the Club Kentucky (often referred to as the \"Kentucky Club\").\n\nEllington made eight records in 1924, receiving composing credit on three including \"Choo Choo\".<ref>{{Harvnb|Hasse|1993|p= 79}}.</ref> In 1925, Ellington contributed four songs to ''Chocolate Kiddies'' starring Lottie Gee and [[Adelaide Hall]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.myspace.com/adelaidehall/photos/albums/chocolate-kiddies-european-tour-1925/2789756 |title=Adelaide Hall &#124; CHOCOLATE KIDDIES EUROPEAN TOUR 1925 Photo Album on Myspace |publisher=Myspace.com |accessdate=February 2, 2013}}</ref> an all-African-American revue which introduced European audiences to African-American styles and performers. Duke Ellington and his Kentucky Club Orchestra grew to a group of ten players; they developed their own sound by displaying the non-traditional expression of Ellington\u2019s arrangements, the street rhythms of Harlem, and the exotic-sounding trombone growls and wah-wahs, high-squealing trumpets, and sultry saxophone blues licks of the band members. For a short time soprano saxophonist [[Sidney Bechet]] played with them, imparting his propulsive swing and superior musicianship to the young band members.\n\n===Cotton Club engagement===\nIn October 1926, Ellington made a career-advancing agreement with agent-publisher [[Irving Mills]],<ref>Gary Giddins ''Visions of Jazz: The First Century'', New York & Oxford, 1998, p.112-13</ref> giving Mills a 45% interest in Ellington's future.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hasse|1993|p=90}}.</ref> Mills had an eye for new talent and early on published compositions by [[Hoagy Carmichael]], [[Dorothy Fields]], and [[Harold Arlen]]. After recording a handful of acoustic titles during 1924-1926, Ellington's signing with Mills allowed him to record prolifically, although sometimes he recorded different versions of the same tune. Mills often took a co-composer credit. From the beginning of their relationship, Mills arranged recording sessions on nearly every label including [[Brunswick Records|Brunswick]], Victor, Columbia, OKeh, Path\u00ea (and its Perfect label), the ARC/Plaza group of labels (Oriole, Domino, Jewel, Banner) and their dime-store labels (Cameo, Lincoln, Romeo), Hit of the Week, and Columbia's cheaper labels (Harmony, Diva, Velvet Tone, Clarion) labels which gave Ellington popular recognition. On OKeh, his records were usually issued as \"The Harlem Footwarmers\", while the Brunswick's were usually issued as ''The Jungle Band''. \"Whoopee Makers\" and the \"Ten Black Berries\" were other pseudonyms.\n\nIn September 1927, [[King Oliver]] turned down a regular booking for his group as the house band at Harlem's [[Cotton Club]];<ref>A.H. Lawrence ''Duke Ellington and His World'', New York & London, 2001, p.77</ref> the offer passed to Ellington after [[Jimmy McHugh]] suggested him and Mills arranged an audition.<ref>Bill Gutman ''Duke: The Musical Life of Duke Ellington'', New York: E-Rights/E-Reads, 1977 [2001], p.35</ref> Ellington had to increase from a six to eleven-piece group to meet the requirements of the Cotton Club's management for the audition,<ref>Duke  Ellington ''Music is my Mistress'', New York: Da Capo, 1973 [1976], p.75-76</ref> and the engagement finally began on December 4.<ref>John Franceschina ''Duke Ellington's Music for the Theatre'', Jefferson, NC: McFarland, 2001, p.16</ref> With a weekly radio broadcast, the Cotton Club's exclusively white and wealthy clientele poured in nightly to see them. At the Cotton Club, Ellington's group performed all the music for the revues, which mixed comedy, dance numbers, vaudeville, burlesque, music, and illegal alcohol. The musical numbers were composed by Jimmy McHugh and the lyrics by Dorothy Fields (later Harold Arlen and [[Ted Koehler]]), with some Ellington originals mixed in. (Here he moved in with a dancer, his second wife [[Mildred Dixon]].) Weekly radio broadcasts from the club gave Ellington national exposure, while Ellington also recorded Fields-JMcHugh and [[Fats Waller]]-[[Andy Razaf]] songs.\n\nAlthough trumpeter [[James \"Bubber\" Miley|Bubber Miley]] was a member of the orchestra for only a short period, he had a major influence on Ellington's sound.<ref name=\"schuller\">{{cite journal|last=Schuller|first=Gunther|date=October 1992|title=Jazz and Composition: The Many Sides of Duke Ellington, the Music's Greatest Composer|journal=Bulletin of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences|publisher=American Academy of Arts & Sciences|volume=46|issue=1|pages=36\u201351|doi=10.2307/3824163|jstor=3824163}}</ref> An early exponent of growl trumpet, his style changed the \"sweet\" dance band sound of the group to one that was hotter, which contemporaries termed \"jungle\" style. In October 1927, Ellington and his Orchestra recorded several compositions with [[Adelaide Hall]]. One side in particular, \"[[Creole Love Call]]\" became a worldwide sensation and gave both Ellington and Hall their first hit record.<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjI1tbAXO2w |title=Adelaide Hall talks about 1920's Harlem and Creole Love Call |publisher=YouTube |accessdate=February 2, 2013}}</ref> Miley had composed most of  \"[[Creole Love Call]]\" and \"Black and Tan Fantasy\". An alcoholic, Miley had to leave the band before they gained wider fame. He died in 1932 at the age of 29, but he was an important influence on [[Cootie Williams]], who replaced him.\n\nIn 1929, the Cotton Club Orchestra appeared on stage for several months in [[Florenz Ziegfeld]]'s ''Show Girl'', along with vaudeville stars [[Jimmy Durante]], [[Eddie Foy, Jr.]], [[Ruby Keeler]], and with music and lyrics by [[George Gershwin]] and [[Gus Kahn]]. [[Will Vodery]], Ziegfeld\u2019s musical supervisor, recommended Ellington for the show, and, according to John Hasse's ''Beyond Category: The Life and Genius of Duke Ellington,'' \"Perhaps during the run of Show Girl, Ellington received what he later termed ' valuable lessons in orchestration from Will Vodery.'  In his 1946 biography, ''Duke Ellington'', [[Barry Ulanov]] wrote:\n\n{{quote|From Vodery, as he (Ellington) says himself, he drew his [[chromatic scale|chromatic]] convictions, his uses of the tones ordinarily extraneous to the [[diatonic scale]], with the consequent alteration of the harmonic character of his music, its broadening, The deepening of his resources. It has become customary to ascribe the classical influences upon Duke \u2013 [[Frederick Delius|Delius]], [[Claude Debussy|Debussy]] and [[Maurice Ravel|Ravel]] \u2013 to direct contact with their music. Actually his serious appreciation of those and other modern composers, came after his meeting with Vodery.<ref>Ulanov, Barry. ''Duke Ellington'', Creative Age Press, 1946.</ref>}}\n\nEllington's film work began with ''[[Black and Tan (film)|Black and Tan]]'' (1929), a nineteen-minute all-African-American RKO short<ref>Stratemann, Dr. Klaus. ''Duke Ellington: Day by Day and Film by Film'', 1992. ISBN 87-88043-34-7</ref> in which he played the hero \"Duke\". He also appeared in the [[Amos 'n' Andy]] film ''[[Check and Double Check]]'' released in 1930. That year, Ellington and his Orchestra connected with a whole different audience in a concert with [[Maurice Chevalier]] and they also performed at the [[Roseland Ballroom]], \"America's foremost ballroom\". Australian-born composer [[Percy Grainger]] was an early admirer and supporter.  He wrote \"The three greatest composers who ever lived are [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]], [[Frederick Delius|Delius]] and Duke Ellington.  Unfortunately Bach is dead, Delius is very ill but we are happy to have with us today The Duke\".<ref>John Bird, ''Percy Grainger''</ref> Ellington's first period at the Cotton Club concluded in 1931.\n\n===The early 1930s===\nEllington led the orchestra by conducting from the keyboard using piano cues and visual gestures; very rarely did he conduct using a baton. As a bandleader, Ellington was not a strict disciplinarian; he maintained control of his orchestra with a combination of charm, humor, flattery, and astute psychology. A complex, private person, he revealed his feelings to only his closest intimates and effectively used his public persona to deflect attention away from himself .\n\nEllington signed exclusively to Brunswick in 1932 and stayed with them through late 1936 (albeit with a short-lived 1933-34 switch to Victor when Irving Mills temporarily moved him and his other acts from Brunswick).\n\nAs the Depression worsened, the recording industry was in crisis, dropping over 90% of its artists by 1933.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hasse|1993|p=166}}.</ref> [[Ivie Anderson]] was hired as their featured vocalist in 1931, she is the vocalist on \"[[It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing)]]\" (1932) among other recordings. Sonny Greer had been providing occasional vocals and continued to do in a cross-talk feature with Anderson. Radio exposure helped maintain popularity as Ellington and his orchestra began to tour. The other records of this era include: \"[[Mood Indigo]]\" (1930),  \"[[Sophisticated Lady]]\" (1933), \"[[(In My) Solitude|Solitude]]\" (1934), and  \"[[In a Sentimental Mood]]\" (1935)\n\nWhile the band's United States audience remained mainly African-American in this period, the Ellington orchestra had a huge following overseas, exemplified by the success of their trip to England in 1933 and their 1934 visit to the European mainland. The English visit saw Ellington win praise from members of the \"serious\" music community, including composer [[Constant Lambert]], which gave a boost to Ellington's interest in composing longer works. Those longer pieces had already begun to appear. He had composed and recorded Creole Rhapsody as early as 1931 (issued as both sides of a 12\" record for Victor and both sides of a 10\" record for Brunswick), and a tribute to his mother, \"Reminiscing in Tempo\", took four 10\" record sides to record in 1935 after her death in that year. ''[[Symphony in Black]]'' (also 1935), a short film, featured his extended piece 'A Rhapsody of Negro Life'. It introduced [[Billie Holiday]], and won an [[Academy Award]] as the best musical short subject.<ref>Schuller, 1989, p.94</ref> Ellington and his Orchestra also appeared in the features  ''[[Murder at the Vanities]]'' and ''[[Belle of the Nineties]]'' (both 1934),\n\nFor agent Mills the attention was a publicity triumph, as Ellington was now internationally known. On the band's tour through the segregated South in 1934, they avoided some of the traveling difficulties of African-Americans by touring in private railcars. These provided easy accommodations, dining, and storage for equipment while avoiding the indignities of segregated facilities. Competition was intensifying though, as swing bands like [[Benny Goodman]]'s, began to receive popular attention. Swing dancing became a youth phenomenon, particularly with white college audiences, and \"danceability\" drove record sales and bookings. [[Jukebox]]es proliferated nationwide, spreading the gospel of \"swing.\" Ellington's band could certainly swing, but their strengths were mood, nuance, and richness of composition, hence his statement \"jazz is music, swing is business\".<ref>{{Harvnb|Hasse|1993|p=203}}.</ref>\n\n===The later 1930s===\nFrom 1936, Ellington began to make recordings of smaller groups (sextets, octets, and nonets) drawn from his then-15-man orchestra and he composed pieces intended to feature a specific instrumentalist, as with \"Jeep's Blues\" for [[Johnny Hodges]], \"Yearning for Love\" for [[Lawrence Brown (musician)|Lawrence Brown]], \"Trumpet in Spades\" for [[Rex Stewart]], \"Echoes of Harlem\" for [[Cootie Williams]] and \"Clarinet Lament\" for [[Barney Bigard]]. In 1937, Ellington returned to the Cotton Club which had relocated to the mid-town [[Theater District]]. In the summer of that year, his father died, and due to many expenses, Ellington's finances were tight, although his situation improved the following year.\n\nAfter leaving agent Irving Mills, he signed on with the [[William Morris Agency]]. Mills though continued to record Ellington. After only a year, his Master and Variety labels, the small groups had recorded for the latter, collapsed in late 1937, Mills placed Ellington back on Brunswick and those small group units on Vocalion through to 1940. Well known sides continued to be recorded, \"[[Caravan (song)|Caravan]]\" in 1937, and \"I Let a Song Go Out of My Heart\" the following year.\n\n[[File:Duke Ellington in ons land.ogv|thumb|Ellington in 1939]]\n[[Billy Strayhorn]], originally hired as a lyricist, began his association with Ellington in 1939.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billystrayhorn.com/biography.htm|title=WILLIAM THOMAS STRAYHORN|last=Stone|first=Sonjia (ed)|year=1983|work=Billy Strayhorn Songs|publisher=University of North Carolina \u2013 Chapel Hill|accessdate=July 14, 2009}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> Nicknamed \"Swee' Pea\" for his mild manner, Strayhorn soon became a vital member of the Ellington organization. Ellington showed great fondness for Strayhorn and never failed to speak glowingly of the man and their collaborative working relationship, \"my right arm, my left arm, all the eyes in the back of my head, my brain waves in his head, and his in mine\".<ref>{{Harvnb|Ellington|1976|p=156}}.</ref> Strayhorn, with his training in classical music, not only contributed his original lyrics and music, but also arranged and polished many of Ellington's works, becoming a second Ellington or \"Duke's doppelganger\". It was not uncommon for Strayhorn to fill in for Duke, whether in conducting or rehearsing the band, playing the piano, on stage, and in the recording studio.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allaboutjazz.com/php/article_print.php?id=31974 |title=Duke Ellington: Symphony of the Body and Soul |publisher=Allaboutjazz.com |accessdate=December 31, 2011}}</ref> The 1930s ended with a very successful European tour just as World War II loomed in Europe.\n\n===Ellington in the early to mid-1940s===\n[[File:Duke Ellington at the Hurricane Club 1943.jpg|thumb|right|Duke Ellington at the Hurricane Club in New York, May 1943]]\nSome of the musicians who joined Ellington at this time created a sensation in their own right. The short-lived [[Jimmy Blanton]] transformed the use of [[Double Bass|double bass]] in jazz, allowing it to function as a solo rather than a rhythm instrument alone. Terminal illness forced him to leave by late 1941 after only about two years. [[Ben Webster]], the Orchestra's first regular tenor saxophonist, whose main tenure with Ellington spanned 1939 to 1943, started a rivalry with Johnny Hodges as the Orchestra's foremost voice in the sax section.\n\nTrumpeter [[Ray Nance]] joined, replacing [[Cootie Williams]] who had \"defected\", contemporary wags claimed, to [[Benny Goodman]]. Additionally, Nance added violin to the instrumental colors Ellington had at his disposal. Recordings exist of Nance's first concert date on November 7, 1940, at [[Fargo, North Dakota]]. Privately made by [[Jack Towers]] and Dick Burris, these recordings were first legitimately issued in 1978 as ''[[Duke Ellington at Fargo, 1940 Live]]''; they are among the earliest of innumerable live performances which survive. Nance was also an occasional vocalist, although [[Herb Jeffries]] was the main male vocalist in this era (until 1943) while [[Al Hibbler]] (who replaced Jeffries in 1943) continued until 1951.

Strayhorn's \"[[Take the \"A\" Train]]\" a hit in 1941, became the band's theme, replacing \"East St. Louis Toodle-Oo\". Ellington and his associates wrote for an orchestra of distinctive voices who displayed tremendous creativity.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://theoryjazz.com/artists/ellington.html|title=Jazz Musicians \u2013 Duke Ellington|publisher=Theory Jazz|accessdate=July 14, 2009}}</ref> [[Mary Lou Williams]], working as a staff arranger, would briefly join Ellington a few years later.\n\nEllington's long-term aim though was to extend the jazz form from that three-minute limit, of which he was an acknowledged master.<ref>{{cite book|last=Crawford|first=Richard|title=The American Musical Landscape|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|year=1993|isbn=0-520-07764-4}}</ref> While he had composed and recorded some extended pieces before, such works now became a regular feature of Ellington's output. In this, he was helped by Strayhorn, who had enjoyed a more thorough training in the forms associated with [[classical music]] than Ellington. The first of these, \"[[Black, Brown, and Beige]]\" (1943), was dedicated to telling the story of African-Americans, and the place of slavery and the church in their history. Ellington debuted ''Black, Brown and Beige'' in [[Carnegie Hall]] on January 23, 1943, beginning an annual series of concerts there over the next four years. While some jazz musicians had played at Carnegie Hall before, none had performed anything as elaborate as Ellington\u2019s work. Unfortunately, starting a regular pattern, Ellington's longer works were generally not well received.\n\nA partial exception was ''Jump for Joy'', a full-length musical based on themes of African-American identity, debuted on July 10, 1941 at the [[Mayan Theater]] in Los Angeles. Hollywood luminaries like actors [[John Garfield]] and [[Mickey Rooney]] invested in the production, and [[Charlie Chaplin]] and [[Orson Welles]] offered to direct.<ref>Harvey G. Cohen ''Duke Ellington's America'', Chicago and London: University of Chicago Press, 2010, p.189</ref> At one performance though, Garfield insisted Herb Jeffries, who is light skinned, should wear make-up. Ellington objected in the interval, and compared Jeffries to [[Al Jolson]]. The change was reverted, and the singer later commented that the audience must have thought he was an entirely different character in the second half of the show.<ref>Cohen, 2010, p190-91</ref>\n\nAlthough it had sold-out performances, and received positive reviews,<ref>Cohen 2010, p.191-92</ref> it ran for only 122 performances until September 29, 1941, with a brief revival in November of that year. Its subject matter did not make it appealing to Broadway; Ellington had unfulfilled plans to take it there.<ref>{{cite web|last=Brent |first=David |url=http://indianapublicmedia.org/nightlights/jump-for-joy-duke-ellingtons-celebratory-musical/ |title=Jump For Joy: Duke Ellington\u2019s Celebratory Musical &#124; Night Lights Classic Jazz \u2013 WFIU Public Radio |publisher=Indianapublicmedia.org |date=February 6, 2008 |accessdate=December 31, 2011}}</ref> Despite this disappointment, a Broadway production of Ellington's ''[[Beggar's Holiday]]'', his sole book musical, premiered on December 23, 1946<ref>A.H. Lawrence ''Duke Ellington and His World'', New York & London: Routledge, 2001, p.287</ref> under the direction of [[Nicholas Ray]].\n\nThe settlement of the [[1942-43 musicians' strike|first recording ban of 1942\u201343]], leading to an increase in royalties paid to musicians, had a serious effect on the financial viability of the big bands, including Ellington's Orchestra. His income as a songwriter ultimately subsidized it. Although he always spent lavishly and drew a respectable income from the Orchestra's operations, the band's income often just covered expenses.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hasse|1993|p=274}}.</ref>\n\n===Early post-war years===\nThe music industry's focus was shifting away from the big bands to the work of solo vocalists such as the young [[Frank Sinatra]] gaining popularity. Ellington's wordless vocal feature \"Transblucency\" (1946) with [[Kay Davis]] was not going to have a similar reach. The new small-group form of jazz, [[bebop]] allowed club owners of smaller venues to draw in the jazz audience at a fraction of the cost of hiring a big band.\n[[File:Jazz musician Duke Ellington.JPEG|thumb|Ellington poses with his piano at the KFG Radio Studio November 3, 1954.]]\n\nEllington continued on his own course through these tectonic shifts. While [[Count Basie]] was forced to disband his whole ensemble and work as an octet for a time, Ellington was able to tour most of Western Europe between 6 April and 30 June 1950, with the orchestra playing 74 dates over 77 days.<ref name=\"Lawrence291\">A.H. Lawrence, 2001, p.291</ref> During the tour, according to Sonny Greer, the newer works were not performed, though Ellington's extended composition, ''[[Harlem (Ellington)|Harlem]]'' (1950) was in the process of being completed at this time. Ellington later presented its score to music-loving President [[Harry Truman]].\n\nIn 1951, Ellington suffered a significant loss of personnel: Sonny Greer, Lawrence Brown, and most importantly [[Johnny Hodges]] left to pursue other ventures, although only Greer was a permanent departee. Drummer [[Louie Bellson]] replaced Greer, and his \"Skin Deep\" was a hit for Ellington. Tenor player [[Paul Gonsalves]] had joined in December 1950<ref name=\"Lawrence291\"/> after periods with [[Count Basie]] and [[Dizzy Gillespie]] and stayed for the rest of his life, while [[Clark Terry]] joined in November 1951.<ref>Ken Vail  ''Duke's Diary: The Life of Duke Ellington'', Lanharn, MD & Oxford, UK: Scarecrow Press, 2002, p.28</ref>\n\nAlthough Ellington's career was generally at a low ebb in the early 1950s, Ellington's reputation did not suffer in comparison with younger figures of the time. [[Andr\u00e9 Previn]] said in 1952: \"You know, [[Stan Kenton]] can stand in front of a thousand fiddles and a thousand brass and make a dramatic gesture and every studio arranger can nod his head and say, \u2018\u2018Oh, yes, that\u2019s done like this.\u2019\u2019 But Duke merely lifts his finger, three horns make a sound, and I don\u2019t know what it is!\"<ref>[[Ralph J. Gleason]] \"Duke Excites, Mystifies Without Any Pretension\", ''Down Beat'', November 5, 1952, reprinted in Jazz Perspectives Vol. 2, No. 2, July 2008, pp. 215\u201349</ref> However by 1955, after three years of recording for [[Capitol Records|Capitol]], Ellington lacked a regular recording affiliation.\n\n===Career revival===\nEllington's appearance at the [[Newport Jazz Festival]] on July 7, 1956 returned him to wider prominence and exposed him to new audiences. The feature \"[[Diminuendo and Crescendo in Blue]]\" comprised two tunes that had been in the band's book since 1937 but largely forgotten until Ellington, who had abruptly ended the band's scheduled set because of the late arrival of four key players, called the two tunes as the time was approaching midnight.  Announcing that the two pieces would be separated by an \"interlude\" played by tenor saxophonist [[Paul Gonsalves]], Ellington proceeded to lead the band through the two pieces, with Gonsalves' 27-chorus marathon solo whipping the crowd into a frenzy, leading the Maestro to play way beyond the curfew time despite urgent pleas from Festive organizer [[George Wein]] to bring the program to an end.\n\nThe concert made international headlines, led to one of only four ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine cover stories dedicated to a jazz musician<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.time.com/time/covers/0,16641,19560820,00.html |title=TIME Magazine Cover: Duke Ellington - Aug. 20, 1956 - Jazz - Music |publisher=Time.com |date=August 20, 1956 |accessdate=February 2, 2013}}</ref> ([[Thelonious Monk]], [[Dave Brubeck]], and [[Wynton Marsalis]] are the others) and resulted in an album produced by [[George Avakian]]<ref name=\"Sohmer\">Jack Sohmer [http://jazztimes.com/articles/10496-ellington-at-newport-1956-complete-duke-ellington \"Duke Ellington: ''Ellington at Newport 1956'' (Complete)\"] ''JazzTimes'', October 1999</ref> that would become the best-selling long-playing recording of Ellington's career.\n\nIronically though, much of the music on the vinyl LP was, in effect, \"simulated\", with only about 40% actually from the concert itself. According to Avakian, Ellington was dissatisfied with aspects of the performance and felt the musicians had been under rehearsed.<ref name=\"Sohmer\"/> The band assembled the next day to re-record several of the numbers with the addition of artificial crowd noise, none of which was disclosed to purchasers of the album. Not until 1999 was the concert recording properly released for the first time. The revived attention brought about by the Newport appearance should not have surprised anyone, Johnny Hodges had returned the previous year, and Ellington's collaboration with Strayhorn had been renewed around the same time, under terms more amenable to the younger man.\n\nThe original ''[[Ellington at Newport]]'' album was the first release in a new recording contract with [[Columbia Records]] which yielded several years of recording stability, mainly under producer [[Irving Townsend]], who coaxed both commercial and artistic productions from Ellington.<ref>{{cite book|last=Wein|first=George|title=Myself Among Others: A Life in Music|publisher=Da Capo Press|year=2003}}</ref>\n\nIn 1957, CBS (Columbia Record's parent corporation) aired a live television production of ''[[A Drum Is a Woman]]'', an allegorical suite which received mixed reviews. His hope that television would provide a significant new outlet for his type of jazz was not fulfilled. Tastes and trends had moved on without him. Festival appearances at the new [[Monterey Jazz Festival]] and elsewhere provided venues for live exposure, and a European tour in 1958 was well received. ''[[Such Sweet Thunder]]'' (1957), based on [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare's]] plays and characters, and ''The Queen's Suite'' (1958), dedicated to Britain's [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]], were products of the renewed impetus which the Newport appearance helped to create, although the latter work was not commercially issued at the time. The late 1950s also saw [[Ella Fitzgerald]] record her ''[[Ella Fitzgerald Sings the Duke Ellington Songbook|Duke Ellington Songbook]]'' (Verve) with Ellington and his orchestra\u2014a recognition that Ellington's songs had now become part of the cultural canon known as the '[[Great American Songbook]]'.\n[[File:James Stewart-Duke Ellington in Anatomy of a Murder trailer.jpg|280px|thumb|right|[[Jimmy Stewart]] and Ellington in ''[[Anatomy of a Murder]]''.]]\nEllington at this time (with Strayhorn) began to work directly on [[Film score|scoring]] for film soundtracks, in particular ''[[Anatomy of a Murder]]'' (1959), with [[James Stewart]], in which Ellington appeared fronting a roadhouse combo, and ''[[Paris Blues]]'' (1961), which featured [[Paul Newman]] and [[Sidney Poitier]] as jazz musicians. ''[[Detroit Free Press]]'' music critic Mark Stryker concludes that the work of [[Billy Strayhorn]] and Ellington in ''Anatomy of a Murder'', a trial court drama film directed by [[Otto Preminger]], is \"indispensable, [although] . . . too sketchy to rank in the top echelon among Ellington-Strayhorn masterpiece suites like ''[[Such Sweet Thunder]]'' and ''[[The Far East Suite]]'', but its most inspired moments are their equal.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.freep.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=200990120016|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090212210625/http://www.freep.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=200990120016|archivedate=February 12, 2009|last=Stryker|first=Mark|title=Ellington's score still celebrated|date=January 20, 2009|work=[[Detroit Free Press]]|accessdate=February 23, 2013}}</ref>\n\nFilm historians have recognized the soundtrack \"as a landmark \u2013 the first significant Hollywood film music by African Americans comprising [[Diegetic#Film sound and music|non-diegetic]] music, that is, music whose source is not visible or implied by action in the film, like an on-screen band.\" The score avoided the cultural [[stereotypes]] which previously characterized jazz scores and rejected a strict adherence to visuals in ways that presaged the [[French New Wave|New Wave]] cinema of the \u201960s\".<ref>Mark Stryker \"Ellington's score still celebrated\", ''[[Detroit Free Press]]'', January 20, 2009; Mervyn Cooke, ''History of Film Music'', 2008, Cambridge University Press.</ref> Ellington and Strayhorn, always looking for new musical territory, produced suites for [[John Steinbeck]]'s novel ''Sweet Thursday'', [[Tchaikovsky]]'s ''Nutcracker Suite'' and [[Edvard Grieg]]'s ''Peer Gynt''.\n\nIn the early 1960s, Ellington embraced recording with artists who had been friendly rivals in the past, or were younger musicians who focused on later styles. The Ellington and [[Count Basie]] orchestras recorded together. During a period when he was between recording contracts, he made records with [[Louis Armstrong]] ([[Roulette Records|Roulette]]), [[Coleman Hawkins]], [[John Coltrane]] (both for [[Impulse! Records|Impulse]]) and participated in a session with [[Charles Mingus]] and [[Max Roach]] which produced the ''[[Money Jungle]]'' ([[United Artists Records|United Artists]]) album. He signed to [[Frank Sinatra]]'s new [[Reprise Records|Reprise label]], but the association with the label was short-lived.\n\nMusicians who had previously worked with Ellington returned to the Orchestra as members: Lawrence Brown in 1960 and [[Cootie Williams]] in 1962.<blockquote>\"The writing and playing of music is a matter of intent.... You can't just throw a paint brush against the wall and call whatever happens art. My music fits the tonal personality of the player. I think too strongly in terms of altering my music to fit the performer to be impressed by accidental music. You can't take doodling seriously.\"<ref name=\"current\"/></blockquote> He was now performing all over the world; a significant part of each year was spent on overseas tours. As a consequence, he formed new working relationships with artists from around the world, including the Swedish vocalist [[Alice Babs]], and the South African musicians [[Abdullah Ibrahim|Dollar Brand]] and [[Sathima Bea Benjamin]] (''A Morning in Paris'', 1963/1997).\n\nEllington wrote an original score for director [[Michael Langham]]'s production of Shakespeare's ''[[Timon of Athens]]'' at the [[Stratford Shakespeare Festival|Stratford Festival]] in Ontario, Canada which opened on July 29, 1963. Langham has used it for several subsequent productions, including a much later adaptation by Stanley Silverman which expands the score with some of Ellington's best-known works.\n\n===Last years===\n\n[[File:Richard Nixon and Duke Ellington 1969.jpg|thumb|250px|Ellington receiving the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]] from [[Richard Nixon|President Nixon]], 1969.]]\n\nEllington was a [[Pulitzer Prize for Music]] nominee in 1965 but was turned down.<ref name=Giddins>[[Gary Giddins]], \"How Come Jazz Isn't Dead\", p. 39\u201355 in {{Harvnb|Weisbard|2004|pp=41\u201342}}.

It was an attempt to fuse Christian liturgy with jazz, and even though it received mixed reviews, Ellington was proud of the composition and performed it dozens of times. This concert was followed by two others of the same type in 1968 and 1973, known as the Second and Third Sacred Concerts. This caused controversy in what was already a tumultuous time in the United States. Many saw the Sacred Music suites as an attempt to reinforce commercial support for organized religion, though Ellington simply said it was \"the most important thing I've done\".<ref>{{Harvnb|Ellington|1976|p=269}}.</ref> The [[Steinway & Sons|Steinway]] piano upon which the Sacred Concerts were composed is part of the collection of the [[Smithsonian]]'s [[National Museum of American History]].

It was during this time that Ellington recorded his only album with [[Frank Sinatra]], entitled ''[[Francis A. & Edward K.]]'' (1967).\n\nEllington was awarded the [[Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award]] in 1966.

According to ''UCLA Magazine'':\n\n{{quote|When UCLA students were entranced by Duke Ellington's provocative tunes at a Culver City club in 1937, they asked the budding musical great to play a free concert in [[Royce Hall]]. 'I've been waiting for someone to ask us!' Ellington exclaimed.\n\nOn the day of the concert, Ellington accidentally mixed up the venues and drove to [[University of Southern California|USC]] instead. He eventually arrived at the UCLA campus and, to apologize for his tardiness, played to the packed crowd for more than four hours. And so, \"Sir Duke\" and his group played the first-ever jazz performance in a concert venue.<ref>Maya Parmer, [http://www.magazine.ucla.edu/depts/happenings/two_days_of_the_duke/  \"Curtain Up: Two Days of the Duke\"], ''UCLA Magazine'', April 1, 2009</ref>}}\n\nThe [[Essentially Ellington High School Jazz Band Competition and Festival]] is a nationally renowned annual competition for prestigious high school bands. Started in 1996 at [[Jazz at Lincoln Center]], the festival is named after Ellington because of the large focus that the festival places on his works.\n\n===Tributes===\n[[Martin Williams (writer)|Martin Williams]] said: \"Duke Ellington lived long enough to hear himself named among our best composers. And since his death in 1974, it has become not at all uncommon to see him named, along with [[Charles Ives]], as the greatest composer we have produced, regardless of category.\"<ref>Martin Williams, liner notes, ''Duke Ellington's Symphony in Black'', The Smithsonian Jazz Repertory Ensemble conducted by [[Gunther Schuller]], The [[Smithsonian]] Collections recording, 1980.</ref>\n\nIn the opinion of Bob Blumenthal of ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' in 1999: \"[i]n the century since his birth, there has been no greater composer, American or otherwise, than Edward Kennedy Ellington.\"<ref>''Boston Globe'', April 25, 1999</ref>\n\nIn 2002, scholar [[Molefi Kete Asante]] listed Duke Ellington on his list of [[100 Greatest African Americans]].<ref>Asante, Molefi Kete (2002).
