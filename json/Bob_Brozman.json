He recorded numerous albums and has won the ''[[Guitar Player]]'' Readers' Poll three times in the best blues, best world and best [[slide guitar]]ist categories. In 1999, Brozman and [[Woody Mann]] founded International Guitar Seminars, which hosts over 120 students annually at sites in [[California]], [[New York]], and [[Canada]].

He also used [[Weissenborn]] style hollow neck acoustic [[steel guitar]]s. Among his National instruments were a [[baritone guitar|baritone]] version of the tricone guitar, which was designed in conjunction with him in the mid to late 1990s. This instrument is now part of National's range of products.\n\nBrozman took his own life on April 23, 2013.<ref>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2013/apr/28/bob-brozman Obituary, The Guardian]</ref>\n\n==Discography==\n* ''Your Pal'' (1977)\n* ''Blue Hula Stomp'' (1981)\n* ''Snapping the Strings'' (1983)\n* ''Hello Central...Give Me Dr. Jazz'' (1985)\n* ''Devil's Slide'' (1988)\n* ''A Truckload of Blues'' (1992)\n* ''Slide A Go-Go'' (1994)\n* ''Blues 'Round the Bend'' (1995)\n* ''Golden Slide'' (1997)\n* ''Kika Kila Meets Ki Ho'Alu'' (with [[Ledward Kaapana]]) (1997)\n* ''Kosmik Blues & Groove'' (1998)\n* ''The Running Man'' (1999)\n* ''Four Hands Sweet & Hot'' (with Cyril Pahinui) (1999)\n* ''Tone Poems III'' (with David Grisman and Mike Auldridge) (2000)\n* ''Get Together'' (2000)\n* ''Jin Jin/Firefly'' (with Takashi Hirayasu) (2000)\n* ''Live Now'' (2001)\n* ''Nankuru Naisa'' (with Takashi Hirayasu) (2001)\n* ''In The Saddle'' (with Ledward Kaapana) (2001)\n* ''Digdig\" (with [[Ren\u00e9 Lacaille]]) (2002)\n* ''Rolling Through This World'' (with [[Jeff Lang]]) (2002)\n* ''Mahima'' (with [[Debashish Bhattacharya]]) (2003)\n* ''Metric Time'' (2003)\n* ''Songs of the Volcano'' (2005)\n* ''Blues Reflex'' (2006)\n* ''Ocean Blues'' (with Djeli Moussa Diawara) (2006)\n* ''Lumiere'' (2007)\n* ''Post-Industrial Blues'' (2007)\n* ''Kani Wai'' (with George Kahumoku Jr) (2009)\n* ''Six Days in Down'' (with [[D\u00f3nal O'Connor]] & John McSherry) (2010)\n* ''Fire in the Mind'' (2012)\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n* Douse, Cliff.
