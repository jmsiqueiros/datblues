In 1929, Spand relocated to [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]], where he met and began performing alongside [[Blind Blake]]. Spand recorded twenty five songs for [[Paramount Records]] between June 1929 and September 1931.  The tracks were variously recorded in [[Richmond, Indiana]], Chicago, and [[Grafton, Wisconsin]]. From the 1929 Richmond recording sessions, were seven songs which had [[guitar]] accompaniment to Spand's piano playing and singing.  Most of these were directly attributed to Blake.  During Spand's most notable recording, he and Blake had a small conversation during the making of \"Hastings Street.\"<ref name=\"AMG 2\"/><ref name=\"Russell\">{{cite book\n| first= Tony\n| last= Russell\n| year= 1997\n| title= The Blues: From Robert Johnson to Robert Cray\n| edition= \n| publisher= Carlton Books Limited \n| location= Dubai\n| isbn= 1-85868-255-X\n| page= 198}}</ref> Another such [[duet (music)|duet]] occurred on \"Moanin' the Blues.\"<ref name=\"AMG\"/>\n \nAfter a gap in his recording career, in June 1940 Spand recorded what turned out to be his final eight tracks, this time for [[Okeh Records]].<ref name=\"AMG 2\"/> These were made in [[Chicago]], when Spand was backed by [[Ernest Lawlers|Little Son Joe]] and [[Big Bill Broonzy]].
