He could project his voice so that it soared over the horn and reed sections in a big-band setting. Basie claimed that Rushing \"never had an equal\" as a blues vocalist, though Rushing \"really thought of himself as a ballad singer.\"<ref name= barlow>Barlow, William (1989).

His father, Andrew Rushing, was a [[trumpet]]er and his mother, Cora and her brother were singers. He studied music theory at Oklahoma City's Douglass High School, and was unusual among his musical contemporaries for having attended college, at [[Wilberforce College]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Daniels |first=Douglas Henry |title=One O'Clock Jump: The Unforgettable History of the Oklahoma City Blue Devils |year=2007 |publisher=Beacon Press |isbn=0-8070-7137-4 |page=52 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Nrne7CjVSvwC&pg=PA240&lpg=PA240&dq=%22jimmy+rushing+%22wilberforce&source=bl&ots=_AYSw6QyHg&sig=gtCXYPjuLVapaEeVTDzkXdAYG20&hl=en&sa=X&ei=INHBUvLBIonEyQGu4IDYCw&ved=0CC4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=wilburforce&f=false}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Oklahoma_City_OK_Old_Douglass_High_School_(Taken_20120926).jpg |title=File:Oklahoma City OK Old Douglass High School (Taken 20120926).jpg - Wikimedia Commons |publisher=Commons.wikimedia.org |date= |accessdate=2014-05-21}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vervemusicgroup.com/jimmyrushing |title=Jimmy Rushing |publisher=Verve Music Group |date= |accessdate=2014-05-21}}</ref> Rushing was inspired to pursue music and eventually sing blues by his uncle Wesley Manning and George \"Fathead\" Thomas of [[McKinney's Cotton Pickers]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Eagle |first=Bob |title=Blues: A Regional Experience |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=6ZNfAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA339&lpg=PA339&dq=Cora+Beuford&source=bl&ots=8GLvcXEig0&sig=6_MejMnQP5q3EChU6--jmPR3lpM&hl=en&sa=X&ei=d7HBUufAKaThyQHjq4HACw&ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=Cora%20Beuford&f=false |publisher=Praeger |accessdate=30 December 2013}}</ref> Rushing toured the Mid-West and [[California]] as an itinerant blues singer in 1923 and 1924 before moving to [[Los Angeles]], [[California]], where he played piano and sang with [[Jelly Roll Morton]]. Rushing also sang with Billy King before moving on to Page's Blue Devils in 1927. He, along with other members of the Blue Devils, defected to the Bennie Moten band in 1929.\n\nMoten died in 1935, and Rushing joined Count Basie for what would be a 13-year tenure. Due to his tutelage under his mentor Moten, Rushing was a proponent of the [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]] jump blues tradition, well exemplified by his performances of \"Sent For You Yesterday\" and \"Boogie Woogie\" for the Count Basie Orchestra. After leaving Basie, his [[sound recording and reproduction|recording]] career soared, as a [[solo (music)|solo]] [[musician|artist]] and a singer with other [[musical ensemble|bands]].\n\nWhen the Basie band broke up in 1950 he briefly retired, then formed his own group. He also made a guest appearance with [[Duke Ellington]] for the 1959 album ''[[Jazz Party]]''.<ref>Dance, Stanley. (November 1998).

Accessed September 8, 2007.</ref> In 1960, he recorded an album with the [[Dave Brubeck Quartet]], known for their cerebral cool jazz sound, but the album was nonetheless described by critic Scott Yanow as \"a surprising success.\"<ref>{{cite web|author=Scott Yanow |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/brubeck-rushing-mw0000600879 |title=Brubeck & Rushing - The Dave Brubeck Quartet &#124; Songs, Reviews, Credits, Awards |publisher=AllMusic |date= |accessdate=2014-05-21}}</ref>\n\nRushing appeared in the 1957 television special ''[[Sound Of Jazz]]'', singing one of his signature songs \"I Left My Baby\" backed by many of his former Basie band compatriots. In 1958 he was among the legendary musicians included in an [[Esquire]] magazine photo by [[Art Kane]] later memorialized in the documentary film, [[A Great Day in Harlem]].<ref>{{cite web |last=Bach |first=Jean |title=A Great Day in Harlem |url=http://www.a-great-day-in-harlem.com/musicians.html |publisher=Flo-Bert, Ltd. and New York Foundation for the Arts |accessdate=30 December 2013 |format=Film |year=1994}}</ref>\n\nIn 1958 Rushing toured the UK with [[Humphrey Lyttelton]] and his Band. A BBC broadcast with Rushing accompanied by Lyttelton's specially organised big band was released on CD in 2009.\n\nIn 1969 Rushing appeared in [[The Learning Tree]], the first major studio feature film directed by an African-American, [[Gordon Parks]].<ref name=IMDb>{{cite web|title=The Learning Tree|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0064579/|accessdate=31 December 2013}}</ref>\n\nAfter he became ill with [[leukemia]] in 1971, Rushing's performing career ended. He died on June 8, 1972, in [[New York City|New York]], and was buried at the Maple Grove Cemetery, Kew Gardens, in [[Queens]], New York.\n\nRushing was married twice. He had two sons, Robert and William, with his second wife Connie, with whom he was married from the 1940s until his death. Connie Rushing is credited with two compositions on her husband's 1968 solo album, \"livin' the blues.\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Bogdanov |first=Vladimir |title=All Music Guide to the Blues: The Definitive Guide to the Blues |year=2003 |publisher=Hal Leonard Corporation |isbn=0-87930-736-6 |page=486 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=qYtz7kEHegEC&pg=PA486&lpg=PA486&dq=%22connie+rushing%22+jimmy&source=bl&ots=AN9Rp0-Ae_&sig=e49psTarVK-iRou9ekBbbwERF20&hl=en&sa=X&ei=MTrCUvr3Eaa0ygGL74HYCw&ved=0CGQQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&q=%22connie%20rushing%22%20jimmy&f=false}}</ref>\n\nJimmy Rushing was one of eight jazz and blues legends honored in a set of [[United States Postal System]] stamps issued in 1994.<ref>{{cite web |title=American Music Series: Jazz Singers Issue |url=http://arago.si.edu/index.asp?con=1&cmd=1&tid=2043144 |publisher=Smithsonian National Postal Museum |accessdate=31 December 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Critical Assessment==\nRushing was held in high critical esteem during his career, and this has continued after his death. [[Whitney Balliett]], jazz critic for [[The New Yorker]], wrote of Rushing that \"His supple, rich voice and his elegant accent have the curious effect of making the typical roughhouse blues lyric seem like a song by [[No\u00ebl Coward]]\".<ref>{{cite book |last=Balliett |first=Whitney |title=Collected Works: A Journal of Jazz, 1954-2000 |year=2000 |publisher=St. Martin's Press |location=New York |isbn=0-312-20288-1 |page=21}}</ref> Critic [[Nat Hentoff]], who ranks Rushing as one of the \"greatest blues singers,\" credits him as a seminal influence in the development of post-World War II popular Black music.
