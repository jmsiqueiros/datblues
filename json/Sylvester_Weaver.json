Both [[sound recording and reproduction|recordings]] were released on [[Okeh Records]]. These recordings are the very first country-blues recordings and the first known recorded songs using the [[slide guitar]] style. \"Guitar Rag\" (played on a [[Guitjo (six-string)|Guitjo]]) became a blues classic and was [[cover version|covered]] in the 1930s by [[Bob Wills and the Texas Playboys]] as \"Steel Guitar Rag\" and became a [[country music]] standard too.\n\nWeaver recorded until 1927, sometimes accompanied by Sara Martin, about 50 additional songs. On some recordings from 1927 he was accompanied by Walter Beasley and the singer [[Helen Humes]]. Weaver often used the [[bottleneck guitar|bottleneck]]-style method, playing his guitar with a knife. His recordings were quite successful but in 1927 he retired and went back to Louisville until his death in 1960. Though many country blues artists had a revival from the 1950s on, Weaver died almost forgotten.\n\nIn 1992 his complete works were released on two CDs, the same year his (up to then anonymous) grave got a headstone by engagement of the Louisville-based [[Kentuckiana Blues Society]] (KBS). Furthermore the KBS has annually honored since 1989 persons who rendered outstanding services to the blues with their Sylvester Weaver Award.\n\n==Works==\n*''Complete Recorded Works Vol. 1 (1923\u20131927)'', 1992, [[Document Records]]\n*''Complete Recorded Works Vol. 2 (1927)'', 1992, Document Records\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.wirz.de/music/weaversy.htm Illustrated Sylvester Weaver discography]\n\nThe content of this article comes from [[:de:Sylvester Weaver|the equivalent German-language Wikipedia article]] (retrieved August 10, 2006).\n\n{{Authority control|VIAF=2660969}}\n{{Persondata\n| NAME              =Weaver, Sylvester\n| ALTERNATIVE NAMES =\n| SHORT DESCRIPTION = [[United States|American]] [[country blues]] guitarist\n| DATE OF BIRTH     =July 25, 1897\n| PLACE OF BIRTH    =[[Louisville, Kentucky]], [[United States]]\n| DATE OF DEATH     =April 4, 1960\n| PLACE OF DEATH    =Louisville, Kentucky, United States\n}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Weaver, Sylvester}}\n[[Category:1897 births]]\n[[Category:1960 deaths]]\n[[Category:African-American guitarists]]\n[[Category:American blues guitarists]]\n[[Category:People from Louisville, Kentucky]]\n[[Category:Musicians from Kentucky]]\n[[Category:Slide guitarists]]\n[[Category:Country blues musicians]]"}]}}}}
