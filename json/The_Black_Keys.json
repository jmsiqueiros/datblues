The group consists of [[Dan Auerbach]] ([[guitar]], [[Singing|vocals]]) and [[Patrick Carney]] ([[Drum kit|drums]]). The duo began as an [[Independent music|independent]] act, recording music in basements and self-producing their records, before they eventually emerged as one of the most popular [[garage rock]] artists during a second wave of the genre's revival in the [[2010s in music|2010s]]. The band's raw [[blues rock]] sound draws heavily from Auerbach's [[blues]] influences, including [[Junior Kimbrough]], [[Howlin' Wolf]], and [[Robert Johnson]].\n\nOriginally friends from their childhood, Auerbach and Carney founded the group after dropping out of college. After signing with [[Independent record label|indie label]] [[Alive Naturalsound Records|Alive]], they released their debut album, ''[[The Big Come Up]]'' (2002), which earned them a new deal with [[Fat Possum Records]]. Over the next decade, the Black Keys built an underground fanbase through extensive touring of small clubs, frequent album releases and music festival appearances, and substantial [[music licensing|licensing]] of their songs. Their third album, ''[[Rubber Factory]]'' (2004), received critical acclaim and boosted the band's profile, eventually leading to a record deal with major label [[Nonesuch Records]] in 2006. After self-producing and recording their first four records in makeshift studios, the duo completed ''[[Attack & Release]]'' (2008) in a professional studio and hired producer [[Danger Mouse]], a frequent collaborator with the band.\n\nThe group's commercial breakthrough came in 2010 with ''[[Brothers (The Black Keys album)|Brothers]]'', which along with its popular single \"[[Tighten Up (The Black Keys song)|Tighten Up]]\", won three [[Grammy Awards]]. Their 2011 follow-up ''[[El Camino (The Black Keys album)|El Camino]]'' received strong reviews and peaked at number two on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart, leading to the first arena concert tour of the band's career, the [[El Camino Tour]]. The album and its hit single \"[[Lonely Boy (The Black Keys song)|Lonely Boy]]\" won three Grammy Awards. In 2014, they released their eighth album, ''[[Turn Blue (album)|Turn Blue]]'', their first number-one record in the US and Australia.\n\n==Career==\n\n===Early history===\nGuitarist/vocalist [[Dan Auerbach]] and drummer [[Patrick Carney]] first met when they were eight or nine years old while living in the same neighborhood of [[Akron, Ohio]].<ref name=\"nymag\">{{cite web|url=http://www.vulture.com/2010/06/black_keys_drummer_patrick_car.html|title=Hilarious Black Keys Drummer Patrick Carney on Not Growing a Beard, Damon Dash, and Danger Mouse|work=[[New York (magazine)|Vulture]]|publisher=New York Media LLC|first=Nishan|last=Gopalan|date=June 3, 2010|accessdate=January 22, 2013}}</ref> While attending [[Firestone High School]], they became friends,<ref name=\"nymag\"/> though they were part of different crowds<ref name=\"amsong\">{{cite web|url=http://www.americansongwriter.com/2011/11/the-black-keys-brothers-in-arms/|title=The Black Keys: Brothers In Arms|work=[[American Songwriter]]|first=Andrew|last=Leahey|date=November 1, 2011|accessdate=December 8, 2011}}</ref>\u2014Auerbach was captain of the high school [[soccer]] team, while Carney was a social outcast.<ref name=\"rs-rising\">{{cite journal|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/the-rise-of-the-black-keys-20120119|title=Black Keys Rising|journal=[[Rolling Stone]]|first=Brian|last=Hiatt|pages=38\u201341, 66|issue=1148|date=January 19, 2012|accessdate=February 17, 2012}}</ref> Encouraged by a mutual friend,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.music.yahoo.ca/read/news/12175063|title=Don't Call the Black Keys 'Garage Blues'|first=Bret|last=Gladstone|work=[[AP Online]]|agency=Associated Press|date=November 24, 2004|accessdate=June 7, 2012}}</ref> the duo began [[jam session|jamming]] together in 1996, as Auerbach was learning guitar at the time and Carney owned a [[Multitrack recording|four-track recorder]] and a drum set.<ref name=\"npr\">{{cite web|url=http://www.npr.org/2011/01/31/133276978/the-fresh-air-interview-the-black-keys|title=The Fresh Air Interview: The Black Keys|work=[[NPR Music]]|publisher=[[NPR]]|date=January 31, 2011|accessdate=February 2, 2012}}</ref><ref name=\"fuzzfreak\">{{cite journal|title=Fuzz freak: the Black Keys' Dan Auerbach on the majesty of muck|journal=[[Guitar Player]]|first=Jimmy|last=Leslie|date=November 1, 2003}}</ref> After graduating, both briefly attended the [[University of Akron]] before dropping out.<ref name=\"amsong\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/life_and_entertainment/2012/03/04/keys-success.html|title=Retro-rock duo from Akron now playing to arena crowds|work=[[The Columbus Dispatch]]|publisher=The Dispatch Printing Company|first=Kevin|last=Joy|date=March 6, 2012|accessdate=March 13, 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Formation, ''The Big Come Up'', and ''Thickfreakness'' (2001\u20132003)===\nAuerbach attempted to make a living from performing at small bars in town, but realized he would not be able to book shows in other cities without a [[demo (music)|demo]].
