Bell played harmonica (harp) and [[bass guitar|bass]] for other blues musicians during the late 1950s, 1960s and early 1970s before embarking on a solo career. Besides his own albums, he recorded as an accompanist or duo artist with [[Earl Hooker]], [[Robert Nighthawk]], [[Lowell Fulson]], [[Eddie Taylor]], [[Louisiana Red]], [[Jimmy Dawkins]] as well as a frequent partner with his son, guitarist [[Lurrie Bell]]. ''Blues Revue'' called Bell \"one of Chicago\u2019s finest harpists.\"<ref name=\"BluesRev\">{{cite |last=Williams|first=Genevieve|newspaper=Blues Revue|date=October 2004}}</ref> The ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' said Bell is \"a terrific talent in the tradition of [[Sonny Boy Williamson I|Sonny Boy Williamson]] and [[Little Walter]].\"<ref name=\"Tribune\">{{cite |last=Knopper|first=Steve|newspaper=The Chicago Tribune|date=29 August 2004}}</ref>\n\n==Career==\n===Early life===\nBell was born '''Carey Bell Harrington''' in [[Macon, Mississippi]].<ref name=\"russell\">{{cite book\n| first= Tony\n| last= Russell\n| year= 1997\n| title= The Blues: From Robert Johnson to Robert Cray\n| edition= \n| publisher= Carlton Books Limited \n| location= Dubai\n| page= 90\n| isbn= 1-85868-255-X}}</ref> As a child, Bell was intrigued by the music of [[Louis Jordan]]. Bell wanted a [[saxophone]] in order to be like his hero Jordan; however, Bell's family could not afford a saxophone he had to settle for the harmonica, colloquially known as a \"Mississippi saxophone.\" Soon Bell was attracted by the blues harmonica greats: [[DeFord Bailey]], [[Big Walter Horton]], Marion \"[[Little Walter]]\" Jacobs, and [[Sonny Boy Williamson I]] and [[Sonny Boy Williamson II|II]]. Bell taught himself to play. By the time he was eight, he was quite proficient on the instrument. When he was thirteen, Bell joined his pianist godfather [[Lovie Lee]]'s blues band.\n\n===Chicago===\nIn September 1956, Lovie Lee convinced Bell to go with him to [[Chicago]].<ref name=\"russell\"/> Not long after arriving, Bell went to the Club Zanzibar, where Little Walter was appearing. Bell met Walter and later learned some harp playing from him and his main Chicago teacher, [[Big Walter Horton]].<ref name=\"russell\"/> To help further his chances of employment as a musician, Bell learned how to play the [[electric bass]] (from [[Hound Dog Taylor]]).<ref name=\"Alligator\">[http://www.alligator.com/index.cfm?section=artists&artistID=35&currTrackNum=1&playPosition=0&vol=70&pan=0&playState=play Carey Bell biography on Alligator Records website]</ref> \n\nDespite Bell's learning from some of the greatest blues harp players of the genre, he arrived in Chicago at an unfortunate time. The demand for harp players was decreasing there as electric guitar became the prominent blues instrument. To pay the bills, Bell continued to play bass and joined several bands as a bassist. In the late 1960s, he appeared regularly on the west side of Chicago with guitarists [[Eddie Taylor]] and [[Royal Johnson]], playing both harmonica and bass. In 1969 Bell toured Europe and the [[United Kingdom|UK]] with the [[American Folk Blues Festival]], and played at the [[Royal Albert Hall]] in London, appearing on a live recording of the event.\n\n===Debut through 1980s===\nIn 1969, [[Delmark Records]] in Chicago released Bell's debut LP, ''Carey Bell's Blues Harp''.<ref name=\"russell\"/> Bell played with [[Muddy Waters]] in late 1970 and 1971 and later with [[Willie Dixon]]'s Chicago Blues All-Stars.<ref name=\"russell\"/> In 1972, Bell teamed up with Big Walter in the studio and released ''Big Walter Horton with Carey Bell'' for [[Alligator Records]]. A year later Bell released a solo project entitled ''Last Night'' for [[Bluesway Records|ABC Bluesway]]. Bell continued to play with Dixon as well as with his own groups, and in 1978, Bell was featured on the [[Grammy Award|Grammy]]-nominated album ''Living Chicago Blues'' on Alligator. Also, in the 1970s, Bell appeared on two Bob Riedy Blues Band recordings.<ref name=Riedy>[http://www.bobriedy.com/discography.html Bob Reidy discography]</ref>\n\nDuring the 1980s Bell continued to record for various labels and to tour. In 1990, Bell teamed up with fellow harpists [[Junior Wells]], [[James Cotton]] and [[Billy Branch]] to record ''Harp Attack!''.<ref name=\"russell\"/> A modern Blues classic, ''Harp Attack!'' became one of Alligator Records's best selling albums.<ref name=\"Alligator\"/>\n\n===Alligator years===\nDespite years in the business and work with Alligator, Bell's first full-length solo album for the label was not until ''Deep Down'', released in 1995. In 1997, Bell released the second album on the label ''Good Luck Man''. ''Second Nature'' (originally recorded in Finland a few years earlier) followed in 2004; a [[duet (music)|duet]] album with his guitarist son, Lurrie Bell (who shared the guitar duties with [[Carl Weathersby]] on ''Deep Down''). \n\nIn 1998, Bell was awarded the [[Blues Music Award]] for Traditional Male Artist Of The Year.\n\n===Final work===\nIn 2007, Delmark Records released a live set by Bell, accompanied by a band which included his son Lurrie, guitarist Scott Cable, Kenny Smith, [[Bob Stroger]] and Joe Thomas.\n\n===Death===\nCarey Bell died of [[heart failure]] on May 6, 2007, in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]].<ref name=\"Alligator2\">[http://www.alligator.com/index.cfm?section=news&newsID=318 Chicago Blues Harmonica Legend Carey Bell 1936 \u2013 2007 (Alligator press release)]</ref>\n\n==Discography==\n*1969 ''Carey Bell's Blues Harp'' (Delmark)\n*1973 ''Last Night'' (One Way)\n*1977 ''Heartaches and Pain'' (Delmark)\n*1982 ''Goin' on Main Street'' (Evidence)\n*1983 ''Son of a Gun'' (Rooster Blues)\n*1986 ''Straight Shoot'' (Blues South West)\n*1988 ''Harpslinger'' (JSP)\n*1990 ''Dynasty!''
