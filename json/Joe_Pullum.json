Pullum's major success was with his self-written song, \"Black Gal What Makes Your Head So Hard?\" (1934).  It sold in large quantities and was [[cover version|covered]] by [[Leroy Carr]], [[Skip James]], [[Mary Johnson (singer)|Mary Johnson]], Jimmie Gordon, [[Josh White]], [[Bumble Bee Slim]], the [[Harlem Hamfats]], [[Smokey Hogg]] and [[James Crutchfield]].

All of his known recordings were collated on two [[Document Records|Document]] [[album]]s released in 1995.\n\n==Legacy==\n[[Music journalism|Music journalist]] Tony Russell wrote that \"Pullum's high clear voice, drifting over the peaks and valleys of \"Black Gal What Makes Your Head So Hard?\", brought the shock of the new into mid-1930s blues. No one before, male or female, had sung with such feline grace. What's more, Pullum's ethereal manner hardly prepared the listener for the song's scenario of insults, smoking pistols and suicide\".<ref name=\"russell\"/>\n\n==Discography==\n*''Complete Recorded Works, Vol. 1 (1934-35)'' - (1995) - [[Document Records|Document]]\n**Personnel: Joe Pullum (vocals); Rob Cooper, Andy Boy (piano)\n*''Complete Recorded Works, Vol. 2 (1933-51)'' - (1995) - Document\n**Personnel: Joe Pullum (vocals); Andy Boy (vocals, piano); Walter \"Cowboy\" Washington (vocals); Melvin Martin, Tiny Webb ([[guitar]]); Chester Boone ([[trumpet]]); Rob Cooper, Lloyd Glenn ([[piano]]); William K. \"Billy\" Hadnott ([[double bass]]); Bob Harvey ([[drum]]s)\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.wirz.de/music/pullufrm.htm Illustrated Joe Pullum discography at Wirz.de]\n*[http://www.nme.com/artists/joe-pullum Videos at NME.com]\n\n{{Persondata <!-- Metadata: see [[Wikipedia:Persondata]]. -->\n| NAME              =Pullum, Joe\n| ALTERNATIVE NAMES =\n| SHORT DESCRIPTION =[[United States|American]] [[Texas blues]] singer and songwriter]\n| DATE OF BIRTH     =December 25, 1905\n| PLACE OF BIRTH    =[[Anniston, Alabama|Anniston]], [[Alabama]], [[United States]]\n| DATE OF DEATH     =January 7, 1964\n| PLACE OF DEATH    =[[Los Angeles]], [[California]], United States\n}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Pullum, Joe}}\n[[Category:1905 births]]\n[[Category:1964 deaths]]\n[[Category:American blues musicians]]\n[[Category:American blues singers]]\n[[Category:American male singers]]\n[[Category:Songwriters from Alabama]]\n[[Category:Musicians from Alabama]]\n[[Category:People from Anniston, Alabama]]"}]}}}}
