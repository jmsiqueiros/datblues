Love''', is the frontman for the band [[G. Love & Special Sauce]].\n\n==Biography==\nDutton, the son of a banking lawyer, was born in the [[Society Hill, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Society Hill]] neighborhood of [[Philadelphia]], and began playing guitar at age eight. He wrote his first song by the time he was in the ninth grade and began playing harmonica in a wire rack. Dutton credits [[Bob Dylan]] and [[John Hammond Jr.]], as well as the then-contemporary \"old school\" [[Hip hop music|hip-hop]] sounds of [[Run-DMC]], the [[Beastie Boys]], and Philadelphia's own [[Schoolly D]], as influences.\n\nDutton, who attended high school at the private [[Germantown Friends School]], began playing solo on the streets of Philadelphia. After one year at [[Skidmore College]], also a private school, Dutton dropped out and relocated to [[Boston]], working as a fundraiser for [[Peace Action]] and playing wherever and whenever he could. One of his few indoor gigs at this time was a Boston bar called The Tam O'Shanter, where he met [[drummer]] [[Jeffrey \"The Houseman\" Clemens]] in January 1993. Dutton and Clemens began working as a duo, they were joined a few months later by bassist [[Jim \"Jimi Jazz\" Prescott]] and became the [[house band]] on Mondays at The Plough and Stars in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]].\n\nThe \"G\" stands for Garrett as said in many radio interviews. He said in an interview that the \"Love\" was just there because it sounded right.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}\n\nG. Love featured [[Jack Johnson (musician)|Jack Johnson]] on his 1999 album ''[[Philadelphonic]]'' playing an early version of Jack Johnson's \"Rodeo Clowns\" when Jack was an unknown artist.
