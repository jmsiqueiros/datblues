He rarely performed in his whole life on his own, most regularly being part of a [[duet (music)|duet]], [[trio (music)|trio]] or [[musical ensemble|group]].<ref name=\"AMG\"/>\n\nHe worked alongside Son Spand, [[Rubin Lacey]] and [[Charlie McCoy]] in the early to mid-1920s, before teaming up in 1928 with Lonnie Chatmon. They formed the [[Mississippi Sheiks]].<ref name=\"AMG\"/> The Sheiks and related groups under other names, such as Mississippi Mud Steppers, the Mississippi Hot Footers and Blacksnakes, recorded about a hundred sides in the first half of the 1930s, among them original compositions (probably by Vinson) such as \"The World is Going Wrong\" and \"I've Got Blood in My Eyes For You\" (1931) - both recorded by [[Bob Dylan]] - or the topical \"Sales Tax\" (1934).<ref name=\"russell\">{{cite book\n| first= Tony\n| last= Russell\n| year= 1997\n| title= The Blues: From Robert Johnson to Robert Cray\n| edition= \n| publisher= Carlton Books Limited \n| location= Dubai\n| isbn= 1-85868-255-X\n| page= 146}}</ref> Vinson claimed to have composed \"[[Sitting on Top of the World]]\" one morning, after playing at a [[White people|white]] dance in [[Greenwood, Mississippi]].<ref name=\"Ginell\">Cary Ginell, ''Milton Brown and the Founding of Western Swing'', [[University of Illinois Press]], 1994, p. 284 - ISBN 0-252-02041-3</ref>\n\nAfter the Sheiks' split up in 1933, Vinson moved around the [[United States]], [[sound recording and reproduction|recording]] with a variety of musicians, including Leroy Carter and Mary Butler.<ref name=\"AMG\"/><ref name=\"Albums\"/>  He moved from [[Jackson, Mississippi]] to [[New Orleans]] and ultimately to [[Chicago]], although by the mid-1940s his appearances in blues [[nightclub|club]]s had dwindled away.  A lengthy break from music saw his re-appearance in 1960.  He performed at [[music festival]]s and recorded further tracks over the next decade, before the onset of [[Atherosclerosis|hardening of the arteries]] curtailed his public appearances.<ref name=\"AMG\"/> Ill health forced his move into a Chicago [[nursing home]] in 1972.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thebluestrail.com/artists/Walter%20Vinson.htm |title=Walter Vinson |publisher=Thebluestrail.com |date= |accessdate=2014-02-04}}</ref>\n\nVinson died in Chicago in 1975 at the age of 74.<ref name=\"AMG\"/> He was interred at the Holy Sepulcher Cemetery in [[Hillside, Illinois]] in an unmarked grave.\n\nIn 2004, the Mississippi Sheiks were inducted in the [[Mississippi Musicians Hall of Fame]], whilst \"[[Sitting on Top of the World]]\" was inducted into the [[List of Grammy Hall of Fame Award recipients Q-Z|Grammy Hall of Fame]] in 2008.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=zk0Z0bD2DGcC&pg=PA507&lpg=PA507&dq=%22sitting+on+top+of+the+world.+grammy+hall+of+fame&source=bl&ots=Wcl0hPKDIj&sig=G9XXBvCYZMzr03gnQMTvoXz4wNg&hl=en&sa=X&ei=qO_wUpC_K8WQhQfNtYDQBQ&ved=0CFYQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&q=%22sitting%20on%20top%20of%20the%20world.%20grammy%20hall%20of%20fame&f=false |title=1,000 Recordings to Hear Before You Die - Tom Moon - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.co.uk |date=2008-08-28 |accessdate=2014-02-04}}</ref>\n\nIn 2009, a concert held by executive producer, Steve Salter, of the nonprofit organization ''Killer Blues'' raised monies to place a headstone on Vinson's grave. The event was a success, and a stone was placed in October, 2009. The concert was held at the Howmet Playhouse Theater in [[Whitehall, Michigan]]. The concert featured blues musicians Thomas Esparza and Lonnie Blonde.\n\n==Discography==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!Year of release\n!Album title\n!Record label\n|-\n|1991\n|''Complete Recorded Works (1928\u20131941)\n|[[Document Records]]\n|}<ref name=\"Albums\">{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/complete-recorded-works-1928-1941-mw0000419407 |title=Complete Recorded Works (1928-1941) - Walter Vinson &#124; Songs, Reviews, Credits, Awards |publisher=AllMusic |date=1941-08-01 |accessdate=2014-01-31}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of Memphis blues musicians]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Persondata\n| NAME              =Vinson, Walter\n| ALTERNATIVE NAMES =\n| SHORT DESCRIPTION =[[United States|American]] [[Memphis blues]] guitarist, singer and songwriter\n| DATE OF BIRTH     =February 2, 1901\n| PLACE OF BIRTH    =[[Bolton, Mississippi]], United States\n| DATE OF DEATH     =April 22, 1975\n| PLACE OF DEATH    =[[Chicago]], [[Illinois]], United States\n}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Vinson, Walter}}\n[[Category:1901 births]]\n[[Category:1975 deaths]]\n[[Category:People from Bolton, Mississippi]]\n[[Category:American blues guitarists]]\n[[Category:American blues musicians]]\n[[Category:American blues singers]]\n[[Category:American male singers]]\n[[Category:Songwriters from Mississippi]]\n[[Category:American violinists]]\n[[Category:Musicians from Mississippi]]\n[[Category:Musicians from Illinois]]\n[[Category:People from Chicago, Illinois]]"}]}}}}
