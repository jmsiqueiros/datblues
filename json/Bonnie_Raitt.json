During the 1970s, Raitt released a series of [[Americana (music)|roots]]-influenced albums which incorporated elements of [[blues]], [[rock music|rock]], [[folk music|folk]] and [[country music|country]]. In the 1990s she had a major return to form with the release of her album \"[[Nick of Time (album)|Nick of Time]]\" after several years of critical acclaim but little commercial success.  The following two albums \"Luck of the Draw\" and \"Longing in Their Hearts\" were also multi million sellers generating several hit singles including \"[[Something to Talk About (Bonnie Raitt song)|Something to Talk About]]\", \"Love Sneakin' Up on You\", and the ballad \"[[I Can't Make You Love Me]]\" (with Bruce Hornsby on piano). Raitt has received ten [[Grammy Awards]]. She is listed as number 50 in ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine's list of the 100 Greatest Singers of All Time<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/100-greatest-singers-of-all-time-19691231/bonnie-raitt-19691231|title=100 Greatest Singers|date=November 23, 2011|publisher=Rolling Stone|accessdate=2012-09-01}}</ref> and number 89 on their list of the 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/100-greatest-guitarists-20111123/bonnie-raitt-19691231|title=100 Greatest Guitarists|date=November 23, 2011|publisher=Rolling Stone|accessdate=2012-09-01}}</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nRaitt was born in Burbank, California. She is the daughter of [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] musical star [[John Raitt]] and his first wife, pianist Marjorie Haydock. She began playing guitar at an early age. Later she gained notice for her [[Slide guitar|bottleneck-style guitar]] playing. Raitt says she played \"a little at school and at [a summer] camp\" called [[Camp Regis-Applejack]] in New York.\n\nAfter graduating from [[Oakwood Friends School]] in [[Poughkeepsie, New York]], in 1967 Raitt entered [[Radcliffe College]] majoring in [[social relation]]s and [[African Studies|African studies]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bonnieraitt.com/bio |title=Bonnie Raitt |publisher=Bonnie Raitt |date= |accessdate=2014-04-19}}</ref> Raitt said her \"plan was to travel to [[Tanzania]], where President [[Julius Nyerere]] was creating a government based on [[democracy]] and [[socialism]]\".<ref name=\"oprah\">\"Bonnie Raitt's Aha! Moment\". ''O, The Oprah Magazine'', v.3, no.7, July 2002, pp.47\u201348.\"</ref> Raitt became friends with then 65-year old bluesman [[Dick Waterman]].<ref name=\"oprah\" />  During her sophomore year Raitt took a semester off and moved to [[Philadelphia]] with Waterman and a number of local musicians. Raitt says it was an \"opportunity that changed everything.\"<ref name=\"oprah\" />\n\n==Career==\n===1970 to 1976===\nIn the fall of 1970, while opening for [[Mississippi Fred McDowell]] at [[the Gaslight Cafe]] in New York, she was seen by a reporter from ''[[Newsweek]]'' Magazine, who began to spread word of her performance. Scouts from major record companies were soon attending her shows to watch her play. She eventually accepted an offer with [[Warner Bros.]] who soon released her debut album, ''[[Bonnie Raitt (album)|Bonnie Raitt]]'', in 1971. The album was warmly received by the music press, many of whom praised her skills as an interpreter and as a bottleneck guitarist; at the time, very few women in popular music had strong reputations as guitarists.\n\nWhile admired by those who saw her perform, and respected by her peers, Raitt gained little public acclaim for her work. Her critical stature continued to grow but record sales remained modest. Her second album, ''[[Give It Up (Bonnie Raitt album)|Give It Up]]'', was released in 1972 to universal acclaim; though many critics still regard it as her best work, it did not change her commercial fortunes. 1973's ''[[Takin' My Time]]'' was also met with critical acclaim, but these notices were not matched by the sales.\n\nRaitt was beginning to receive greater press coverage, including a 1975 cover story for ''[[Rolling Stone Magazine]]'', but with [[1974 in music|1974's]] ''[[Streetlights (Bonnie Raitt album)|Streetlights]]'', reviews for her work were becoming increasingly mixed. By now, Raitt was already experimenting with different producers and different styles, and she began to adopt a more mainstream sound that continued through 1975's ''[[Home Plate (album)|Home Plate]]''.\n\nIn 1976, Raitt made an appearance on [[Warren Zevon]]'s eponymous album with his friend [[Jackson Browne]] and [[Fleetwood Mac]]'s [[Lindsey Buckingham]] and [[Stevie Nicks]].\n\n===1977 to 1988: Commercial breakthrough===\n[[File:Bonnie Raitt2.jpg|thumb|230px|Raitt performing at the [[Berkeley Community Theater]], 1976\u20131977]]\n1977's ''[[Sweet Forgiveness]]'' album gave Raitt her first commercial breakthrough when it yielded a hit single in her [[cover song|cover]] of [[Runaway (Del Shannon song)|\"Runaway.\"]] Recast as a heavy [[rhythm and blues]] recording based on a rhythmic groove inspired by [[Al Green]], Raitt's version of \"Runaway\" was disparaged by many critics. However, the song's commercial success prompted a bidding war for Raitt between [[Warner Bros.]] and [[Columbia Records]]. \"There was this big Columbia \u2013 Warner war going on at the time\", recalled Raitt in a 1990 interview. \"[[James Taylor]] had just left Warner Bros. and made a big album for Columbia...And then, Warner signed [[Paul Simon]] away from Columbia, and they didn't want me to have a hit record for Columbia \u2014 no matter what! So, I renegotiated my contract, and they basically matched Columbia's offer. Frankly the deal was a really big deal.\"\n\nWarner Brothers held higher expectations for Raitt's next album, ''[[The Glow]]'' in 1979, but it was released to poor reviews as well as modest sales. Raitt would have one commercial success in 1979 when she helped organize the five [[Musicians United for Safe Energy]] (MUSE) concerts at [[Madison Square Garden]] in New York City. The shows spawned the [[No Nukes (album)|a three-record gold album]] as well as a Warner Brothers feature film, ''[[No Nukes (film)|No Nukes]]''. The shows featured co-founders [[Jackson Browne]], [[Graham Nash]], [[John Hall (New York)|John Hall]], and Raitt as well as [[Bruce Springsteen]], [[Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers]], [[The Doobie Brothers]], [[Carly Simon]], [[James Taylor]], [[Gil Scott-Heron]], and numerous others.\n\nFor her next record, [[1982 in music|1982's]] ''[[Green Light (Bonnie Raitt album)|Green Light]]'', Raitt made a conscious attempt to revisit the sound of her earlier records. However, to her surprise, many of her peers and the media compared her new sound to the burgeoning [[New wave music|new wave]] movement. The album received her strongest reviews in years, but her sales did not improve and this would have a severe impact on her relationship with Warner Brothers.\n\n===Drop from Warner Brothers===\nIn 1983, as Raitt was finishing work on her follow-up album, entitled ''Tongue & Groove'', Warner Brothers \"cleaned house\", dropping a number of major artists such as [[Van Morrison]] and [[Arlo Guthrie]] from their roster. The day after mastering was completed on ''Tongue & Groove'', the record label dropped Raitt also. The album was shelved indefinitely, and Raitt was left without a record label. By then, Raitt was also struggling with alcohol and drug abuse problems.<ref name=\"notbroken\">{{cite news |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/2100-3445_162-1209936.html |title=Bonnie Raitt Will Not Be Broken |publisher=[[CBS News]] |last=Benjamin |first=Scott |date=2009-02-18 |accessdate=2012-04-13}}</ref>\n\nDespite her personal and professional problems, Raitt continued to tour and participate in [[Activism|political activism]]. In 1985, she sang and appeared in the video of \"[[Sun City (song)|Sun City]]\", the anti-[[apartheid]] record written and produced by guitarist [[Steven Van Zandt]]. Along with her participation in [[Farm Aid]] and [[Amnesty International]] concerts, Raitt traveled to [[Moscow]] in 1987 to participate in the first joint Soviet/American Peace Concert, later shown on the [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] television network. Also in 1987, Raitt organized a benefit in Los Angeles for Countdown '87 to Stop [[Contras|Contra]] Aid. The benefit featured herself along with musicians [[Don Henley]], [[Herbie Hancock]], [[Holly Near]] and others.\n\n===''Tongue and Groove's'' name change and release===\n[[Image:Bonnie Raitt.jpg|thumb|200px|Raitt at the 1990 [[Grammy Awards]]]]\nTwo years after dropping her from their label, Warner Brothers notified Raitt of their plans to release ''Tongue & Groove''. \"I said it wasn't really fair,\" recalled Raitt. \"I think at this point they felt kind of bad. I mean, I was out there touring on my savings to keep my name up, and my ability to draw was less and less. So they agreed to let me go in and recut half of it, and that's when it came out as ''[[Nine Lives (Bonnie Raitt album)|Nine Lives]]''.\" A critical and commercial disappointment, [[1986 in music|1986's]] ''[[Nine Lives (Bonnie Raitt album)|Nine Lives]]'' would be Raitt's last new recording for Warner Brothers.\n\nIn late 1987, Raitt joined singers [[k.d. lang]] and [[Jennifer Warnes]] as female background vocals for [[Roy Orbison]]'s television special, ''[[Roy Orbison and Friends, A Black and White Night]]''. Following this highly acclaimed broadcast, Raitt began working on new material. By then, Raitt was clean and sober, having resolved her [[substance abuse]] problem. She later credited [[Stevie Ray Vaughan]] for his help in a [[Minnesota State Fair]] concert<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20070828220833/http://www.startribune.com/457/v-print/story/38243.html\n|title=Grand stands: A longtime fairgoer's most unforgettable shows\n|author=Jon Bream\n|date=August 22, 2002\n|publisher=StarTribune.com\n|accessdate=2011-04-07}}</ref> the night after Vaughan's 1990 death. During this time, Raitt considered signing with [[Prince (musician)|Prince]]'s own label, [[Paisley Park]], but negotiations ultimately fell through. Instead she began recording a bluesy mix of pop and rock under the production guidance of [[Don Was]] at [[Capitol Records]].\n\nRaitt had met Was through [[Hal Wilner]], who was putting together ''[[Stay Awake: Various Interpretations of Music from Vintage Disney Films|Stay Awake]]'', a tribute album to [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] music for [[A&M Records|A&M]]. Was and Wilner both wanted Raitt to sing lead on an adult-contemporary arrangement created by Was for \"Baby Mine\", the [[lullaby]] from ''[[Dumbo]]''. Raitt was very pleased with the sessions, and she asked Was to produce her next album.\n\n===1989 to 1995: Increased recognition===\nAfter nearly 20 years, Bonnie Raitt achieved belated commercial success with her tenth album, ''[[Nick of Time (album)|Nick of Time]]''. Released in the spring of 1989, ''Nick of Time'' went to the top of the U.S. charts following Raitt's Grammy sweep in early 1990. This album has been voted number 230 in the Rolling Stone magazine list of 500 Greatest Albums Of All Time. Raitt herself pointed out that her 10th try was \"my first sober album.\"<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/500-greatest-albums-of-all-time-20120531/bonnie-raitt-nick-of-time-19691231\n|title=500 Greatest Albums of All Time\n|date=May 31, 2012\n|publisher=Rolling Stone\n|accessdate=2012-09-01}}</ref>\n\nAt the same time, Raitt received a fourth [[Grammy Award]] for her duet \"In the Mood\" with [[John Lee Hooker]] on his album ''[[The Healer (album)|The Healer]]''. [[Nick of Time (album)|Nick of Time]] was also the first of many of her recordings to feature her longtime rhythm section of [[Ricky Fataar]] and [[James \"Hutch\" Hutchinson]] (Although previously Fataar had played on her Green Light album and Hutchinson had worked on Nine Lives). ''Nick of Time'' has sold over six million copies in the US alone.''\n\nRaitt followed up this success with three more Grammy Awards for her 1991 album, ''[[Luck of the Draw (album)|Luck of the Draw]]'' which sold nearly 8 million copies in the United States. Three years later, in 1994, she added two more Grammys with her album ''[[Longing in Their Hearts|Longing In Their Hearts]]'', her second no. 1 album. Both of these albums were multi-platinum successes. Raitt's collaboration with Was would amicably come to an end with [[1995 in music|1995's]] live release, ''[[Road Tested]]''. Released to solid reviews, it sold well enough to be certified gold.\n\nFor her next studio album, Raitt hired [[Mitchell Froom]] and [[Tchad Blake]] as her producers. \"I loved working with [[Don Was]] but I wanted to give myself and my fans a stretch and do something different,\" Raitt said. Her work with Froom and Blake was released on ''[[Fundamental (Bonnie Raitt album)|Fundamental]]'' in 1998.\n\n===1996 to 2007 ===\n[[File:BonnieRaitt2004.jpg|thumb|200px|Raitt performing at the [[New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival]], April 23, 2004]]\nIn March 2000, Raitt was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in [[Cleveland, Ohio]].\n\n''[[Silver Lining (album)|Silver Lining]]'' was released in 2002. In the US, it reached 13 on the Billboard chart and was later certified Gold.  It contains the 3 singles \"I Can't Help You Now\", \"Time of Our Lives\" and the title track. All 3 singles charted within the top 40 of the US A/C chart.\n\nIn 2003 Capitol Records released the compilation album ''The Best of Bonnie Raitt''. It contains songs from her prior Capitol albums from 1989 - 2002 including ''Nick of Time'', ''Luck of the Draw'', ''Longing in Their Hearts'', ''Road Tested'', ''Fundamental'', and ''Silver Lining''.\n\n''[[Souls Alike]]'' followed and was released in September 2005. In the US, it reached the top 20 on the Billboard chart. It contains the singles \"I Will Not Be Broken\" and \"I Don't Want Anything to Change\", which both charted in the top 40 of the US A/C chart.\n\nIn 2006 she released the live album ''Bonnie Raitt and Friends''.  Special guests include Keb Mo', Alison Krauss, Ben Harper, Jon Cleary and Norah Jones.\n\nAustralian Country Music Artist [[Graeme Connors]] has said, \"Bonnie Raitt does something with a lyric no one else can do; she bends it and twists it right into your heart.\" (ABC Radio NSW Australia interview with Interviewer Chris Coleman on 18 January 2007)<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20080201182827/http://www.abc.net.au/nsw/stories/s2137964.htm?nsw\n|title=Summer Conversations January 2008\n|author=Chris Coleman\n|date=January 18, 2008\n|publisher=ABC New South Wales.

She performed two blues songs with Kevin \"[[Keb' Mo']]\" Moore: \"No Getting Over You\" and \"There Ain't Nothin' in Ramblin'.\" Raitt also sang [[Dimming of the Day]] with [[Richard Thompson (musician)|Richard Thompson]]. This show, along with another one which Raitt with her band in October 2006, is archived on the Prairie Home Companion web site.\n\nIn February 2012, Raitt performed a duet with [[Alicia Keys]] at the [[54th Grammy Awards]] in 2012 honoring [[Etta James]].\n\nIn April 2012, Raitt released her first studio album since 2005 entitled ''[[Slipstream (Bonnie Raitt album)|Slipstream]]''. It charted at number 6 on the US [[Billboard 200]] chart marking her first top ten album since 1994's ''[[Longing in Their Hearts]]''.
