She was spotted by [[Willie Dixon]] in 1962, and this led to wider performances and her first recording contract. In 1965, Taylor was signed by [[Chess Records]] subsidiary [[Checker Records]] where she recorded \"[[Wang Dang Doodle]]\", a song written by Dixon and recorded by [[Howlin' Wolf]] five years earlier. The record became a hit, reaching number four on the R&B charts and number 58 on the pop charts<ref>Top Pop Singles 1955-1999. Joel Whitburn. 2000. Record Research Inc. p. 641. ISBN 0-89820-139-X</ref> in 1966, and selling a million copies.<ref name=\"kottrib\" /> Taylor recorded several versions of \"Wang Dang Doodle\" over the years, including a live version at the 1967 [[American Folk Blues Festival]] with harmonica player [[Little Walter]] and guitarist [[Hound Dog Taylor]]. Taylor subsequently recorded more material, both original and [[cover version|covers]], but never repeated that initial chart success.\n\nNational touring in the late 1960s and early 1970s improved her [[fan (person)|fan]] base, and she became accessible to a wider record-buying public when she signed with [[Alligator Records]] in 1975. She recorded nine albums for Alligator, 8 of which were Grammy-nominated, and came to dominate the female blues singer ranks, winning twenty five [[Blues Music Award|W. C. Handy Award]]s (more than any other artist). After her recovery from a near-fatal [[Traffic collision|car crash]] in 1989, the 1990s found Taylor in [[film]]s such as ''[[Blues Brothers 2000]]'' and ''[[Wild at Heart (film)|Wild at Heart]]'', and she opened a blues [[nightclub|club]] on [[Division Street (Chicago)|Division Street]] in Chicago in 1994, which relocated to Wabash Ave in Chicago's South Loop in 2000. (The club is now closed.)\n\nTaylor influenced musicians such as [[Bonnie Raitt]], [[Shemekia Copeland]], [[Janis Joplin]], [[Shannon Curfman]], and [[Susan Tedeschi]]. In the years prior to her death, she performed over 70 concerts a year and resided just south of Chicago in [[Country Club Hills, Illinois]].\n\nIn 2008, the [[Internal Revenue Service]] said that Taylor owed $400,000 in back taxes, penalties and interest. Her tax problems concerned 1998, 2000 and 2001; for those years combined, her adjusted gross income was $949,000.<ref>{{cite news |title=Singing Tax Blues |author=Janet Novack and William P.
