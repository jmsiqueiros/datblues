His career spanned almost fifty years, during which he performed and recorded with seminal groups including [[John Mayall]]'s [[Bluesbreakers]] and the [[Ike Turner|The Ike & Tina Turner Revue]]. He is perhaps best known for his innovative [[arrangement]] of the [[Ike Turner|Ike]] and [[Tina Turner|Tina]] version of the [[Creedence Clearwater Revival]] song, \"[[Proud Mary]]\".<ref name=\"pressrelease\">[http://lists.drizzle.com/pipermail/postcard2/20040130/021485.html Soko Richardson] press release from [http://www.pressnetwork.com pressnetwork.com] Fri Jan 30, 2004</ref><ref name=\"Paiste\">[http://www.paiste.com/news/viewnews.php?newsid=4 Noted Soul Drummer Soko Richardson Dies] February, 2004</ref>\n\n==Biography==\nBorn in [[New Iberia, Louisiana]], Richardson began his musical career at the age of 16, when he left home to tour the [[Southern United States|South]] with local bands. Shortly thereafter [[Ike Turner]], upon hearing Richardson play in [[Texas]], hired him to play with his band, Kings of Rhythm, and then later with The Ike & Tina Turner Revue. Richardson worked with Turner for the next ten years. In March 1971 Richardson's arrangement of the [[Creedence Clearwater Revival]] song, \"[[Proud Mary]]\" reached number four on the pop charts, and number five on the R&B charts. The song became a signature song for [[Tina Turner]], and won the band a Grammy for \"Best R&B Vocal Performance By A Group.\"<ref name=\"pressrelease\"/><ref name=\"rollingstone\">''The Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock & Roll'' (Revised edition, 2001) New York, Fireside/Simon & Schuster. pp.1010 ISBN 0-7432-0120-5</ref>\n\nIn 1971, Richardson joined [[John Mayall]]'s [[Bluesbreakers]], with whom he would tour and record for the next decade, playing with many of the diverse artists to whom Mayall gave a start.<ref name=\"bluesbreakers\">[http://www.classicwebs.com/mayall.htm John Mayall's Bluesbreakers] accessed March 7, 2007</ref><ref name=\"mayalldiscography\">[http://www.softshoe-slim.com/lists/m/mayall.html John Mayall Albums] accessed March 7, 2007</ref><ref name=\"rollingstone2\">''The Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock & Roll'' p.621</ref>\n\nIn the mid 1980s, Richardson joined [[Albert Collins]] and the Icebreakers, and became an influential member of the [[Chicago]] [[Chicago Blues|Blues]] scene.
