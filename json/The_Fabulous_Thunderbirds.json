In 2011, they signed with [[Severn Records]].<ref name='BIRDS'>{{cite web | url = http://blues.about.com/b/2011/11/11/severn-records-goes-to-the-birds.htm | title = Severn Records Goes to the Birds | accessdate = 2011-11-14 | last = Gordon | first = Kieth A. | date = Nov 11, 2011 | publisher = [[About.com]]; Blues}}</ref>\n\nTheir first two [[album]]s were released in 1979 and 1980 with [[Kim Wilson]]'s lead vocals and harp, [[Jimmie Vaughan]] as lead guitarist, [[Keith Ferguson (musician)|Keith Ferguson]] on [[bass guitar]].  Mike Buck was on [[Drum kit|drum]]s for the first album, but left the band, and was replaced by Fran Christina on the second. Both albums initially sold through the small number printed,(about 3 thousand units) and are now regarded as significant blues recordings.<ref>[http://www.bluesmusic.lt/index.php/lt/istorijos/bliuzo-istorija/1269-100-greatest-blues-albums \"100 Greatest Blues Albums\"] on Blues Music website</ref>  The Thunderbirds' blues style mixed [[Texas blues]] with the [[harmonica]] laced [[swamp blues]] sounds of [[Slim Harpo]] and [[Lazy Lester]] &mdash; both of whom the Thunderbirds [[cover version|covered]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Slim Harpo|url=http://www.bluesharp.ca/legends/sharpo.html|accessdate=20 March 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Lazy Lester|url=http://www.emusic.com/music-news/spotlight/lazy-lester-the-return-of-the-last-true-bluesman/}}</ref> The band's third album, ''Butt-Rockin''', released in 1981, took the band closer to old [[rhythm and blues]] and added additional musicians playing [[piano]] and [[brass instrument|brass]].\n\nAlthough the Fabulous Thunderbirds had become favorites of fellow musicians &mdash; opening shows for the likes of [[The Rolling Stones]] and [[Eric Clapton]] &mdash; and had been critically well-received, the band's [[gramophone record|records]] did not sell particularly well.<ref>{{cite web|last=Thomas |first=Stephen |url={{Allmusic|class=artist |id=p4217/biography |pure_url=yes}} |title=The Fabulous Thunderbirds |publisher=AllMusic |date= |accessdate=2011-12-08}}</ref> Chrysalis dropped the band following the release of ''T-Bird Rhythm'', leaving the band without a contract for four years. While still in limbo, the Fabulous Thunderbirds continued to play concerts across the U.S. During this time, bassist Keith Ferguson left the band and was replaced by Preston Hubbard, a former member of [[Roomful of Blues]]. In 1985, the band finally landed another recording contract with Epic/Associated.\n\nThe [[single (music)|single]], \"Tuff Enuff\" was featured in the 1986 film ''[[Gung Ho (film)|Gung Ho]]''. It was also featured in the film ''[[Tough Guys]]'', as was the follow-up single \"Wrap It Up\", which went to number 50 in the Billboard Hot 100. \"Tuff Enuff\" remains the band's only Top 40 hit, peaking at #10 on the [[Billboard Hot 100]]. The album \"Tuff Enuff\" went gold in several countries and subsequently platinum in the United States with sales of 1 million plus. The band's music was also used in the 1987 movie ''[[Hot Pursuit (film)|Hot Pursuit]]''. The Fabulous Thunderbirds' next album, ''Hot Number'', fell off the [[record chart|charts]] quickly. But following that, their recording of ''Powerful Stuff'' was a success, based in part upon its inclusion in the 1988 film ''[[Cocktail (1988 film)|Cocktail]]''. The band then embarked on a long series of line-up changes and albums throughout the 1990s. Long time drummer Fran Christina left in 1996 and went on to join with Marsha Ball and later Doug Sahm's \"Last Real Texas Blues Band\".\n\nJimmie Vaughan left the band to play in a [[duet (music)|duo]]  with his brother [[Stevie Ray Vaughan]]; following Stevie Ray's death in 1990, Jimmie pursued a full-time solo career.<ref name=\"russell\">{{cite book\n| first= Tony\n| last= Russell\n| year= 1997\n| title= The Blues - From [[Robert Johnson (musician)|Robert Johnson]] to [[Robert Cray]]\n| edition= \n| publisher=Carlton Books Limited\n| location= Dubai\n| page= 110\n| isbn= 1-85868-255-X}}</ref> The Fabulous Thunderbirds replaced Vaughan with two [[guitarist]]s, [[Duke Robillard]] and Kid Bangham.<ref name=\"russell\"/>\n\nDoug \"Kid\" Bangham left the band after three years to pursue a solo career and open the Carver School of Music and the Carver Institute of Rock in Carver, MA.\n\nIn the early 1990s, Kim Wilson recorded a pair of solo albums while continuing to tour with The Fabulous Thunderbirds.<ref name=\"russell\"/> In 1994, the band recorded a ninth album, ''Roll of the Dice'', which was released on [[Private Music]] in 1995. ''High Water'' followed in 1997, although this was actually a collaboration between Wilson and studio musicians [[Fabulous Thunderbirds|Steve Jordan]] and [[Danny Kortchmar]] issued under the Fabulous Thunderbirds name.\n\nOn the evening of February 16, 2000, The Fabulous Thunderbirds made history, becoming the first band ever to be broadcast on the Internet using high-definition cameras. The companion DVD, Invitation Only, is one of the first high-resolution multi-track recordings of a live concert event. The companion CD Live! was released in 2001.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fabulousthunderbirds.com |title=Fabulousthunderbirds.com |publisher=Fabulousthunderbirds.com |date=2011-05-05 |accessdate=2011-12-08}}</ref>\n\nThe band recorded ''Painted On'' in 2005, produced by Steve Berlin (of [[Los Lobos]]) and featuring Rachel Nagy of The Detroit Cobras on the track ''Love Speaks Louder Than Words''. Guitarist [[Nick Curran (musician)|Nick Curran]] joined Wilson on vocals for ''Two Time Fool''.\n\nThe Fabulous Thunderbirds have maintained an intense touring schedule throughout the United States and Europe since the early 1990s.\n\nBassist Ronnie James and guitarist Troy Gonyea toured, to considerable acclaim, with [[Booker T. Jones]] in England in 2009, with the addition of guitar player [[Marc Ford]] from [[The Black Crowes]] and Darian Gray on drums.\n\nThe band released a new album in 2013 entitled, ''On the Verge''.<ref>{{cite web|first=J.C.|last=Ma\u00e7ek III|work=[[PopMatters]]|date=10 April 2013|title=The Fabulous Thunderbirds: On the Verge|url=http://www.popmatters.com/pm/review/169829-the-fabulous-thunderbirds-on-the-verge/}}</ref>\n\n==Line-ups==\n\n[[File:KimWilson1996.jpg|thumb|201px|right|Kim Wilson]]\n[[File:JimmieVaughanCrossroads2007.jpg|thumb|201px|right|Jimmie Vaughan]]\n[[File:Keith Ferguson1.jpg|thumb|201px|right|Keith Ferguson]]\n[[File:Nick-Curran 2007.jpg|thumb|201px|right|Nick Curran]]\n[[File:Duke Robillard.jpg|thumb|201px|right|Duke Robillard]]\n[[File:JohnnyMoeller2007.jpg|thumb|201px|right|Johnny Moeller]]\n{| class=\"toccolours\" border=1 cellpadding=2 cellspacing=0 style=\"float: lleft; width: 375px; margin: 0 0 1em 1em; border-collapse: collapse; border: 1px solid #E2E2E2;\"\n|-\n!
