At the age of five, he wanted to be a musician. He began playing the drums and soon added guitar. Kravitz grew up listening to the music his parents listened to: [[rhythm and blues|R&B]], [[jazz]], [[classical music|classical]], opera, [[gospel music|gospel]], and [[blues]]. \"My parents were very supportive of the fact that I loved music early on, and they took me to a lot of shows,\" Kravitz said.<ref name=\"Henderson2002\">Henderson.

''[[The Guardian]]''.</ref> His father, who was also a jazz promoter, was friends with [[Duke Ellington]], [[Sarah Vaughan]], [[Count Basie]], [[Ella Fitzgerald]], [[Bobby Short]], [[Miles Davis]] and other jazz greats. Ellington even played \"[[Happy Birthday to You|Happy Birthday]]\" for him one year when he was about 5.<ref name=\"ebony1994\"/> He was exposed to the [[soul music]] of [[Motown Records|Motown]], [[Stax Records|Stax]], [[James Brown]], [[Aretha Franklin]], [[Al Green]], [[Stevie Wonder]], [[Curtis Mayfield]], [[Gladys Knight]], [[The Isley Brothers]] and [[Gamble and Huff]] growing up who were key influences on his musical style. Kravitz often went to see New York theater, where his mother worked. His mother encouraged his dreams of pursuing music.\n\nIn 1974, the Kravitz family relocated to Los Angeles when Kravitz's mother landed her role on ''The Jeffersons''. At his mother's urging, Kravitz joined the California Boys Choir for three years, where he performed a classical repertoire, and sang with the [[Metropolitan Opera]]. He took part in [[Gustav Mahler|Mahler's]] [[Symphony No. 3 (Mahler)|Third Symphony]] at the [[Hollywood Bowl]]. It was in Los Angeles that Kravitz was first introduced to rock music, listening to [[Led Zeppelin]], [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]], [[Aerosmith]], [[Jimi Hendrix]], [[Pink Floyd]], [[Cream (band)|Cream]], and [[The Who]].<ref name=\"guardian2002\"/> \"I was attracted to the cool style, the girls, the rock 'n' roll lifestyle,\" Kravitz said.<ref name=\"guardian2002\"/> Kravitz's other musical influences at the time included [[Fela Kuti]], [[Bill Withers]], [[Marvin Gaye]], [[Pharoah Sanders]] and [[Miles Davis]];<ref name=\"guardian2002\"/> [[John Lennon]] and [[Bob Marley]] proved later to be influential as well. Kravitz attended [[Beverly Hills High School]]. [[Maria McKee]], actor [[Nicolas Cage]] and musician [[Slash (musician)|Slash]] were his classmates. In 1978, Kravitz was accepted into the school's well-respected music program. He taught himself to play piano and [[bass (guitar)|bass]], and made friends with [[Zoro (drummer)|Zoro]] who would later become his long-time collaborator.<ref>Evans, Mia \"[http://www.cbn.com/cbnmusic/interviews/Zoro113006.aspx The Faith of Zoro]\". ''CBN.com''. Retrieved on March 13, 2007.</ref> Kravitz wanted to be a [[session musician]]. He also appeared as an actor in television commercials during this time.\n\n==Career==\n\n===1989\u201390: Virgin Records and career debut===\nWith record labels still telling him his music wasn't \"black enough\" or \"white enough,\" Kravitz decided to record an album on his own. Kravitz had met [[recording engineer]]/keyboardist/bassist Henry Hirsch in 1985 when recording a demo at his [[Hoboken, New Jersey]] recording studio. The two shared an interest in using real instruments and vintage recording equipment, as well as a love of R&B, jazz, and rock. Kravitz would go on to collaborate with Hirsch on most of his albums. Kravitz began working on his debut album with Hirsch over the next year and a half, with Kravitz's father paying for the studio time. Kravitz met [[saxophonist]] [[Karl Denson]] and invited him to play on the song, \"Let Love Rule.\" Kravitz was so impressed with his playing that Denson played on much of the album. Denson toured with Kravitz for the next five years. In October 1988, after completing most of the recording, Kravitz approached friend Stephen Elvis Smith who had served as the Music Supervisor on [[Lisa Bonet]]'s spin-off of ''[[The Cosby Show]]'', ''[[A Different World]]''. Smith had also worked with Kravitz' mother [[Roxie Roker]], on the hit sitcom ''[[The Jeffersons]]''. Kravitz urged Smith to manage his career and assist him in finding a record deal. In less than a month of shopping the recordings, five labels (Warner Bros, Elektra, Geffen, Capitol and Virgin) were in a bidding war for Kravitz. Eventually a deal was made with Virgin Records in January 1989, and signed by Virgin A & R executive Nancy Jeffries. The label was excited about the music he was making, music inspired by his relationship with wife Bonet and their new daughter, Zoe. On Smith's urging, Kravitz dropped the name Romeo Blue and reclaimed the Lenny Kravitz moniker. About his time as Romeo Blue, Kravitz said, \"Ultimately, it got me back to myself. And when I finally did accept myself for myself, music started flowing out of me.\"<ref name=\"Henderson2002\"/>\n\nKravitz released his d\u00e9but album ''[[Let Love Rule]]'' on September 6, 1989, a combination of rock and funk with a general 1960s vibe. Music critics were mixed: some felt Kravitz was a gifted new artist, others felt he was overpowered by his musical influences. The album was a moderate success in the United States, but became an instant hit outside of the US, especially in Europe. Lisa Bonet directed the debut music video for the title track, \"Let Love Rule.\" Stephen Smith signed Kravitz with talent booking agency CAA, who soon were fielding offers for Kravitz, first on a club tour, and then in opening slots for [[Tom Petty & the Heartbreakers]], [[Bob Dylan]] and David Bowie. Having played essentially all of the instruments on the album, Kravitz had to quickly assemble a touring band to support the Let Love Rule release. They included a childhood friend, [[Zoro (drummer)|Zoro]] on drums (formerly of Bobby Brown's band), [[Adam Widoff]] (guitar), [[Lebron Scott]] (bass guitar, recruited out of Curtis Mayfield's band after seeing them perform in a NYC club), [[Kenneth Crouch]] (keyboards) and [[Karl Denson]] on saxophone.\n\nIn May 2009, a 20th Anniversary Deluxe Edition of \"Let Love Rule\" was released worldwide by Virgin. The double disk includes a booklet with rare photos, and 18 additional demos, bonus tracks and live recordings. Kravitz launched a LLR(20) tour of Europe and the United States in support of the re-release.\n\n===1991\u20132001: Popularity established===\nIn 1990, Kravitz produced the song \"[[Justify My Love]]\" for [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]], which he co-wrote with [[Ingrid Chavez]]. The song, which appeared on her greatest hits album ''[[The Immaculate Collection]]'' and created controversy because of its explicit video, went to number 1 for two consecutive weeks. When MTV banned the video, the video was quickly made available for sale at record stores, and immediately sold over 500,000 copies. Kravitz separated from Lisa Bonet in 1991,<ref name=\"behindthemusic\">\"Behind The Music: Lenny Kravitz.\" (1999).</ref> amid rumors of an affair between him and Madonna. Kravitz has denied any infidelity.<ref name=\"behindthemusic\"/> Kravitz and Bonet divorced in 1993.\n\nIn 1991, Kravitz produced the self-titled album ''[[Vanessa Paradis (album)|Vanessa Paradis]]'' for French singer and actress [[Vanessa Paradis]]. He played most of the instruments and co-wrote most of the songs on the album. He also released his second album, ''[[Mama Said (album)|Mama Said]],'' which was his first album to reach the [[Top 40]]. The songs on the album were about Bonet and dedicated to her, documenting his depression over their breakup.<ref name=\"ebony1994\">Norment, Lynn (June 1994). \"[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1077/is_n8_v49/ai_15405340 Lenny Kravitz: brother with a different beat \u2013 musician].\" ''[[Ebony (magazine)|Ebony]].''

The event featured rare RHO memorabilia and the work of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' photographer [[Mark Seliger]].\n\nIn 1993, Kravitz wrote \"Line Up\" for [[Aerosmith|Aerosmith's]] [[Steven Tyler]], and appeared on [[Mick Jagger]]'s solo album, ''[[Wandering Spirit (album)|Wandering Spirit]]'', in a cover of the [[Bill Withers]] soul classic \"[[Use Me (Bill Withers song)|Use Me]]\", and played guitar on the title track of [[David Bowie]]'s ''[[The Buddha of Suburbia (soundtrack)|The Buddha of Suburbia]]''. That year Kravitz also got to work with idols [[Al Green]] and [[Curtis Mayfield]].\n\nIn 1993, ''[[Are You Gonna Go My Way]]'' was released, reaching number 12 on the ''Billboard'' 200 and Kravitz earned a [[BRIT Awards|BRIT Award]] for best international male artist in 1994. The [[Are You Gonna Go My Way (song)|title track]] won a [[MTV Video Music Award for Best Male Video]] for the video produced by [[Mark Romanek]], in which Kravitz slung his dreadlocks and wore high-heeled platform boots. During the presentation of the [[MTV Video Music Awards]], he performed the song with [[John Paul Jones (musician)|John Paul Jones]] of [[Led Zeppelin]] on bass. Several singles from the album would follow including, \"Believe,\" \"Is There Any Love In Your Heart,\" and \"Heaven Help/Spinning Around Over You.\" This album was the first to feature guitarist [[Craig Ross]], who has also played on all his subsequent albums.<ref>[http://craigross.net/] {{dead link|date=April 2014}}</ref> One song, \"Eleutheria,\" was influenced by the island [[Eleuthera]] in [[The Bahamas]] where Kravitz built a house and recording studio at that time.<ref name=\"ebony1994\"/> In 1993, he also released the EP ''Spinning Around Over You'', which included four live tracks from his \"Universal Love Tour\". A feature documentary about his 1994 tour entitled ''Alive From Planet Earth'' was directed by [[Doug Nichol]] and released.\n\nIn 1994, Kravitz recorded a funk-rock version of the song \"[[Deuce (song)|Deuce]],\" for the [[KISS (band)|KISS]] cover album ''[[KISS My Ass: Classic KISS Regrooved]]''. The track featured [[Stevie Wonder]] on harmonica and background vocals. This song was one of three radio singles from the album, and was also the album's lead-off track.\n\nRoxie Roker, Kravitz's mother, died in California on December 2, 1995, of breast cancer at the age of 66.\n\nIn 1995, Lenny Kravitz released the album ''[[Circus (Lenny Kravitz album)|Circus]],'' which went to number 10 on the ''Billboard'' chart on the back of his past achievement. However, the album only had two hit singles: \"[[Rock and Roll Is Dead]]\" and \"Can't Get You Off My Mind.\"\n\nWith ''[[5 (Lenny Kravitz album)|5]]'' (1998), Kravitz embraced digital technology such as [[Pro Tools]] and [[sampler (musical instrument)|sampler]]s for the first time. ''5'' introduced his music to an even wider audience thanks to the hit single \"[[Fly Away (Lenny Kravitz song)|Fly Away]]\" being featured prominently in both car manufacturer and airline commercials. ''5'' would reach number 28 on the ''Billboard'' 200, with \"Fly Away\" reaching number 12 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 and number 1 in the [[United Kingdom]]. He would win the first of his four consecutive [[Grammy Award for Best Male Rock Vocal Performance|Grammy for Best Male Rock Vocal Performance]] at the [[Grammy Awards of 1999]]. Other hits from the album included \"If You Can't Say No\", that was also remixed by dance producer [[Brian Transeau]], and \"[[I Belong to You (Lenny Kravitz song)|I Belong to You]].\" For the [[I Belong to You (Lenny Kravitz song)|I Belong to You]] video Lenny can be seen without his signature [[dreadlocks]]. In 1999 he produced and sang with [[Cree Summer]] on her solo album [[Street Faerie]].\n\nHis [[cover version]] of [[The Guess Who|The Guess Who's]] hit \"[[American Woman (song)|American Woman]]\" won him another Grammy at the [[Grammy Awards of 2000]] and helped The Guess Who's song reach a new audience. Kravitz's version of the song originally came from the soundtrack of ''[[Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me]]'' and was added to ''5'' as a bonus track in 1999.\n\nKravitz worked on two songs for [[Michael Jackson]]'s ''[[Invincible (Michael Jackson album)|Invincible]]'' album released in 2001; a snippet of \"[[Another Day (Michael Jackson song)|Another Day]]\" has leaked, and the full version was officially released on the album Michael in 2010 .<ref>[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Igl53o-Csys]{{dead link|date=September 2011}}</ref>\n\nKravitz released a ''[[Greatest Hits (Lenny Kravitz album)|Greatest Hits]]'' album in 2000. It proved to be his most successful album, reaching #2 on the ''Billboard'' 200 and selling nearly 11 million copies worldwide and ultimately becoming one of the most commercially successful albums of the decade. The single \"[[Again (Lenny Kravitz song)|Again]]\" earned him his third consecutive Grammy for the Best Male Rock Vocal in the [[Grammy Awards of 2001]] and peaked at number 4 on the US ''Billboard'' Hot 100. Kravitz also co-wrote the song \"God Gave Me Everything\" with [[Mick Jagger]] in this period, appearing on Jagger's 2001 solo album ''[[Goddess in the Doorway]]'' and in the film ''[[Being Mick]].''\n\n===2001\u201305: ''Lenny'' and ''Baptism''===\n[[File:Lenny Kravitz (Brasilia, 2005).jpeg|thumb|Kravitz in [[Bras\u00edlia]], Brazil on March 19, 2005]]\nKravitz released his sixth album ''[[Lenny (album)|Lenny]]'' in October 2001. The album was recorded in Miami. Kravitz wrote the song \"Bank Robber Man\" after the [[Miami Police Department]] detained and cuffed him while walking to the gym with his trainer because police stated that he matched the description of a bank robber. Kravitz did not have any identification with him at the time and the police on the scene did not believe that he was indeed Lenny Kravitz. The bank teller who was robbed was then brought to the scene and said Kravitz was not the bank robber. Miami Police later sent officers to Kravitz's home to apologize for the detention. When asked if he thought the incident was a case of [[racial profiling]], Kravitz said he wasn\u2019t sure although some of the lyrics in the song suggest otherwise. The first single from the album, \"[[Dig In]]\", went to number 1 in Argentina and the top 10 in Italy and Portugal. The video for \"Dig In\" was originally supposed to be shot at the top of the [[Empire State Building]] on September 12, 2001 but the terrorist attacks on the [[World Trade Center]] on September 11, 2001 caused the location to be moved. The video was later shot off the coast Miami. He won his fourth Grammy in [[Grammy Awards of 2002|2002]]. \"Stillness of Heart\", \"Believe in Me\", and \"If I Could Fall In Love\" were subsequent singles from the album.\n\nKravitz was the subject of a photo book by former chief photographer for ''Rolling Stone'', [[Mark Seliger]].

The track reached #1 on the world internet download charts and [[MP3.com]] download chart. Kravitz also appeared on ''Unity'', the official album of the [[2004 Summer Olympics|2004 Athens Olympics]], and performed a cover of \"[[Have You Ever Been (To Electric Ladyland)]]\" on the album ''[[Power of Soul: A Tribute to Jimi Hendrix]]''.\n\n\nKravitz's seventh album ''[[Baptism (Lenny Kravitz album)|Baptism]]'' was released in May 2004. The first single was \"[[Where Are We Runnin'?]]\". The single \"California\" failed to be commercially successful, but \"Storm\", featuring [[Jay-Z]], reached the charts. \"Calling All Angels\" was successful in various countries and a huge hit in Brazil, however it was \"Lady\" that became the album's surprise hit, making the US Top 30 and propelling ''Baptism'' to gold status. Also in 2004, he appeared on [[N.E.R.D]]'s album ''[[Fly or Die]]''. From March 2005, Kravitz toured all over the world with the tour ''Electric Church'', which ended at the [[Brixton Academy]], London in July 2005.

The tour began on October 30 at the [[Mohegan Sun Arena]] in [[Uncasville]], [[Connecticut]]. The night before that tour started, October 29, 2005, Lenny's father TV Producer [[Sy Kravitz]] died. During that first show, Lenny broke the news to the stunned crowd and stated it was not a time to be sad but rather a time to celebrate because he is now in Heaven. Lenny then dedicated ''[[Let Love Rule]]'' to his father. That tour was so successful that it was extended through February 25, 2006 and ended in [[Anaheim]], California.\n\n===2006\u201309: Live Earth, charity work, and ''It Is Time for a Love Revolution''===\nIn January 2006, Kravitz contributed \"Breathe\" to absoluttracks, a project sponsored by [[Absolut Vodka]].

The video premiered on VH1's Top 20 Countdown at number 3.\n\nOn January 17, 2008, Kravitz embarked on a 9 city mini-tour to promote his new album ''It Is Time for a Love Revolution''. The tour started in [[Santa Monica]], California and ended in New York City on February 1. The tour was done in association with Myspace and called the \"Get on the Bus\" tour. At each stop on the tour, they would pick up one contest winner and their guest and they rode on the \"Love Revolution\" bus until the end of the tour. Steven Tyler of Aerosmith, a close friend of Lenny's would appear at The Orpheum Theater in Boston. The New York City winner, Tyrone Good was presented a train ticket from Penn Station to travel to Philadelphia and rode with the tour the rest of the way starting in Philadelphia (The Electric Factory), Boston (The Orpheum Theater), and finally New York City (The Hammerstein Ballroom). The winners were featured in the YRB February Edition alongside Lenny Kravitz in a magazine pull-out. The photo shoot took place at the Electric Factory in Philadelphia on stage. The winner's pull out was featured in another issue of YRB which had Lil' Wayne on the cover.\n\nOn February 11, 2008, Kravitz was admitted to Miami Hospital suffering from severe [[bronchitis]]. He had been suffering from a series of severe respiratory tract infections since mid-January, and the illness developed into bronchitis.\n\nKravitz's illness had forced him to postpone Canadian dates and his trip to Europe to promote his album ''It Is Time for a Love Revolution''. On March 19, 2008 he canceled the South American part of his tour due to the same illness. The decision affected planned concerts in [[Colombia]], Mexico, [[Brazil]] and [[Argentina]].
