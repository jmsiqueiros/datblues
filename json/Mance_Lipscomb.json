These gatherings were hosted regularly for a while by himself and his wife. The majority of his musical activity took place within what he called his \"precinct\", meaning the local area around Navasota, until around 1960.\n\nFollowing his \"discovery\" by McCormick and Strachwitz, Lipscomb became an important figure in the folk music revival of the 1960s. He was a regular performer at folk festivals and folk-blues clubs around the United States, notably the Ash Grove in Los Angeles, CA.\n\nHe died in Navasota in 1976, two years after suffering a [[stroke]].\n\n==Film==\n*''A Well Spent Life'' (1971).
