B. King|BB King]], and [[Johnny \"Guitar\" Watson]].\n\n==Early career==\nJimmie Lawrence Vaughan was born on March 20, 1951 in [[Dallas County, Texas|Dallas County]], [[Texas]], to parents, Jimmie Lee Vaughan and Martha Jean Cook. Raised in [[Dallas, Texas]], Vaughan moved to Austin in the late 1960s and began playing with such musicians as Paul Ray and [[W. C. Clark|WC Clark]].\n\nIn 1969, Vaughan's group opened for [[Jimi Hendrix Experience|The Jimi Hendrix Experience]] in [[Fort Worth, Texas]]. It was at this show that Vaughan lent [[Jimi Hendrix]] his [[Vox (musical equipment)|Vox]] [[Wah-wah pedal]] which Hendrix ending up breaking. In turn, Hendrix gave Vaughan his own touring Wah-wah pedal.\n\nJimmie Vaughan developed his own easily recognized personal style. He formed the band [[The Fabulous Thunderbirds]] with singer and [[harmonica|harpist]] [[Kim Wilson]], bassist [[Keith Ferguson (musician)|Keith Ferguson]], and drummers [[Mike Buck]] and Fran Christina. (The original Fabulous Thunderbirds were all [[Mentorship|prot\u00e9g\u00e9s]] of Austin, Texas, blues club owner [[Clifford Antone]]). The band's first four albums, released between 1979 and 1983, are ranked among the most important 'white blues' recordings. These early albums did not sell well, so the band was left without a recording contract for a couple of years (during the time when Vaughan's younger brother achieved commercial success). During this time, Vaughan played lead guitar on fellow Texas blues musician Bill Carter's 1985 album, ''Stompin' Grounds'', also playing Carter's most well-known song, \"Willie The Wimp\",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/Bill-Carter-Stompin-Grounds/release/2565478 |title=Bill Carter (2) - Stompin' Grounds (Vinyl, LP, Album) at Discogs |publisher=Discogs.com |date= |accessdate=2014-05-29}}</ref> which would later be introduced a year later to Stevie Ray Vaughan and played on live albums.\n\nThe Fabulous Thunderbirds got a new contract in 1986, and made several albums with a more commercially popular sound and production style. Vaughan left the band in 1989, and made his only \"duo album\", ''[[Family Style]]'', with his younger brother, [[Stevie Ray Vaughan]]. Before the album's release, Stevie Ray died in a helicopter crash along with three members of [[Eric Clapton]]'s entourage in [[East Troy, Wisconsin]], on August 27, 1990. The album was released a few days after the accident. The artist listed on the album was \"The Vaughan Brothers\". The album was light, blues-influenced rock, with Jimmie Vaughan singing on several tracks.\n[[File:JimmieVaughanCrossroads2007.jpg|thumb|220px|Vaughan performing at the 2007 Crossroads Guitar Festival]]\n\nVaughan released his first solo album ''Strange Pleasure'' in 1994. The album contained a song \"Six Strings Down\" that was dedicated to the memory of his brother. He has continued his solo career since then. Vaughan's solo albums contain mostly blues-rock material that he writes himself. He made a special guest appearance on [[Bo Diddley]]'s 1996 album ''A Man Amongst Men,'' playing guitar on the tracks \"He's Got A Key\" and \"Coatimundi\". In 2001, Vaughan paid an installment on his (and the Fabulous Thunderbirds') debt to [[harmonica]] [[swamp blues]] when he contributed guitar to the [[Lazy Lester]] album ''Blues Stop Knockin.' ''\n\nSince 1997 Fender has produced a [[Jimmie Vaughan Tex-Mex Stratocaster]].\n\nVaughan appeared in the 1998 released film ''[[Blues Brothers 2000]]'' as a member of the fictional \"Louisiana Gator Boys\" blues band led by BB King.\n\nVaughan is close friends with [[Dennis Quaid]]. They worked together on the film ''[[Great Balls of Fire! (film)|Great Balls of Fire]]''.\n\nVaughan was the third opening act for most of the dates of [[Bob Dylan]]'s summer 2006 tour, preceded by [[Elana James|Elana James and the Continental Two]] and [[Junior Brown]].\n\nVaughan loves classic and [[custom car|custom]] cars, and is an avid car collector.
