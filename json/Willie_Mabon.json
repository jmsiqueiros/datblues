He formed a group, the Blues Rockers, and in 1949 began [[sound recording and reproduction|recording]] for the [[Aristocrat Records|Aristocrat]] [[record label|label]], and then [[Chess Records|Chess]].\n\nHis biggest success came in 1952 when his debut solo release, \"[[I Don't Know (Willie Mabon song)|I Don't Know]]\", topped the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs|R&B chart]] for eight weeks.<ref name=\"russell\">{{cite book\n| first= Tony\n| last= Russell\n| year= 1997\n| title= The Blues: From Robert Johnson to Robert Cray\n| edition= \n| publisher= Carlton Books Limited \n| location= Dubai\n| isbn= 1-85868-255-X\n| page= 139}}</ref>\nIt was one of the most popular releases of its era, becoming Chess's biggest [[hit single|hit]] in the period before [[Chuck Berry]]'s and [[Bo Diddley]]'s success.  It also became one of the first R&B [[hit record]]s to be [[cover version|covered]] by a leading [[white people|white]] [[musician|artist]], [[Tennessee Ernie Ford]].  Mabon's original was played on [[Alan Freed]]'s early [[radio]] shows and also sold well to white audiences, crossing over markets at the start of the [[rock and roll]] era. \n\nMabon returned to the top R&B slot in 1953 with \"I'm Mad\", and had another hit in 1954 with the [[Mel London]] song \"Poison Ivy\". However, his career failed to maintain its momentum, and record releases in the late 1950s on a variety of [[record label]]s were largely unsuccessful. Releases in the 1960s included \"I'm The Fixer\" and \"Got To Have Some\".<ref name=\"russell\"/>\n\nAfter a 1972 move to Paris, Mabon toured and recorded in [[Europe]] as part of promoter Jim Simpson's ''American Blues Legends'' tour, recording ''The Comeback'' for Simpson's [[Big Bear Records]] label, and his 1977 album on [[Ornament Records]].<ref name=\"Wirz\">{{cite web |url= http://www.wirz.de/music/ornament.htm|title= Ornament Discography|first1= Stefan |last1= Wirz|date= January 8, 2010|work= American Music|publisher= |accessdate=January 30, 2010}}</ref>  He also performed at the [[Montreux Jazz Festival]].<ref name=\"oldies\"/>  In April 1985, after a long illness, Mabon died in Paris.<ref>[http://thedeadrockstarsclub.com/1980.html Thedeadrockstarsclub.comn - accessed November 2009]</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\n*\"[[I Don't Know (Willie Mabon song)|I Don't Know]]\" was [[cover version|covered]] by [[The Blues Brothers]] in 1978.\n*His song \"Just Got Some\" was covered by [[Rod Stewart]].\n*His song \"I'm Mad\" is featured in the [[Marv Newland]] 1980 animated short [[film]], ''Sing Beast Sing.''\n*\"[[The Seventh Son (song)|Seventh Son]]\", first recorded by Mabon in 1955, has since been covered by a number of artists including [[Johnny Rivers]], [[Georgie Fame]], [[John Mellencamp]], [[Billy \"Crash\" Craddock]], [[Mose Allison]], [[Sting (musician)|Sting]], [[Climax Blues Band]], and [[Long John Baldry]].\n\n[[File:Willie Mabon - Chicago Blues Session coverart.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Willie Mabon album cover, 1979]]\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of Chicago blues musicians]]\n*[[List of artists who reached number one on the Billboard R&B chart]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{allmusic |id=p437 }}\n* [http://www.wirz.de/music/mabon.htm Illustrated Willie Mabon discography]\n\n{{Authority control|VIAF=37102609}}\n{{Persondata <!-- Metadata: see [[Wikipedia:Persondata]]. -->\n| NAME              = Mabon, Willie\n| ALTERNATIVE NAMES =\n| SHORT DESCRIPTION = [[United States|American]] [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]] singer, songwriter and pianist\n| DATE OF BIRTH     = October 24, 1925\n| PLACE OF BIRTH    = [[Hollywood, Memphis|Hollywood]], [[Tennessee]], [[United States]] \n| DATE OF DEATH     = April 19, 1985\n| PLACE OF DEATH    = [[Paris]], [[France]]\n}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Mabon, Willie}}\n[[Category:1925 births]]\n[[Category:1985 deaths]]\n[[Category:African-American musicians]]\n[[Category:American rhythm and blues musicians]]\n[[Category:Chicago blues musicians]]\n[[Category:American blues pianists]]\n[[Category:Songwriters from Tennessee]]\n[[Category:American pianists]]\n[[Category:American male singers]]\n[[Category:People from Memphis, Tennessee]]\n[[Category:Chess Records artists]]"}]}}}}
