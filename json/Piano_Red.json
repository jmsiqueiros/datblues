He was a self-taught pianist who played in the [[Boogie-woogie|barrelhouse]] blues style (a loud percussive type of blues piano suitable for noisy bars or taverns). His performing and recording careers emerged during the period of transition from completely [[Racial segregation in the United States|segregated]] \"race music\", to \"[[rhythm and blues]]\", which was marketed to white audiences. Some music historians credit Perryman's 1950 recording \"Rocking With Red\" for the popularization of the term rock and roll in [[Atlanta]].<ref name=\"NGE\">{{NGE|Laura McCarty|the Georgia Humanities Council|12/10/2005|1660}}</ref> His simple, hard-pounding left hand and his percussive right hand, coupled with his cheerful shout, brought him considerable success over three decades.\n\n==Life==\nPerryman was born on a farm near [[Hampton, Georgia|Hampton]], Georgia, where his parents Ada and Henry Perryman [[Sharecropping|sharecropped]]. He was part of a large family, though sources differ on exactly how many brothers and sisters he had. Perryman was an [[Albinism|albino]] African American, as was his older brother Rufus, who also had a blues piano career as \"[[Speckled Red]]\".<ref name=NGE/>\n\nWhen Perryman was six years old, his father gave up farming and moved the family to [[Atlanta]] to work in a factory. Not much is known about Perryman's education or early life, but he recalled that his mother bought a piano for her two albino sons. Both brothers had very poor vision, an effect of their albinism, so neither took formal music lessons, but they developed their barrelhouse style through playing by ear. Perryman sometimes recalled imitating Rufus's style after watching him play, but it is doubtful that his brother was a major influence. Rufus, nineteen years older than Perryman, left Georgia in 1925 and did not return until a 1960 visit. Another influence that Perryman cited in interviews was [[Fats Waller]], whose records his mother brought home. Other influences were likely the local blues pianists playing at \"house\" or \"rent\" parties, which were common community fund-raisers of that era.<ref name=NGE/>\n\nBy the early 1930s, Perryman was playing at house parties, [[juke joints]], and barrelhouses in Georgia, [[Alabama]], and [[Tennessee]]. He developed his percussive playing style and harsh singing style to compensate for the lack of sound systems and to overcome the noise of people talking in venues. He worked these circuits with other Georgia bluesmen, including [[Barbecue Bob]], [[Charlie Hicks]], [[Curley Weaver]], and [[\"Blind Willie\" McTell]].<ref name=NGE/>\n\nPerryman married in the early 1930s, and he and his wife Flora had two daughters. He obtained seasonal employment performing in [[Brevard, North Carolina|Brevard]], North Carolina, a mountain resort town, and commuted back and forth between there and Atlanta. The Brevard job brought him before white audiences; by 1934 he had also begun to play at white clubs in Atlanta. In Atlanta he would play at a white club until midnight and then head over to an African American club, where he would play until 4 am. Perryman developed a repertoire of pop standards, which were more popular among the white audiences, while continuing his blues sets in the African American clubs.<ref name=\"NGE\"/>\n\nAround 1936 he began to be billed as 'Piano Red', and made his first recordings with McTell in Augusta for [[Vocalion Records]], although these were never released. He also began working as an upholsterer, a trade which he occasionally maintained through later years.<ref name=\"NGE\"/>\n\nIn 1950, after spending the previous 14 years upholstering and playing music on weekends, Perryman recorded \"Rockin' with Red\" and \"Red's Boogie\" at the [[WGST]] radio studios in Atlanta for [[RCA Records|RCA Victor]]. Both songs became national hits, reaching numbers five and three respectively on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs|R&B]] chart, and \"Rockin' with Red\" has since been [[cover version|covered]] many times under many titles. This success, along with further hits \"The Wrong Yo Yo\" (allegedly written by Speckled Red), \"Laying The Boogie\" and \"Just Right Bounce\", allowed him to resume an active performing schedule. He also recorded sessions in New York City and [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]] during the early 1950s.  \n\nDuring the mid-1950s Perryman also worked as a [[disc jockey]] on radio stations [[WGST]] and [[WAOK]] in Atlanta, broadcasting 'The Piano Red Show' (later 'The Dr. Feelgood Show') directly from a small shack in his back yard. A young [[James Brown]] made an appearance on his show in the late 1950s.  Perryman's involvement had him appearing on a flatbed truck in many parades, which led to his song \"Peachtree Parade\".  From the mid-1950s until the late 1960s, he recorded for several [[record label]]s, including [[Columbia Records|Columbia]], for whom he made several records, [[Checker Records|Checker]], for whom he recorded eight sides with [[Willie Dixon]] on [[double bass|bass]], and [[Groove Records]], a subsidiary of RCA Victor, producing the first hit for that label.<ref name=\"shaw\">{{cite book\n| first= Arnold\n| last= Shaw\n| year= 1978\n| title= Honkers and Shouters\n| edition=\n| publisher=Macmillan Publishing Company\n| location= New York\n| pages= 460\u2013462\n| isbn= 0-02-061740-2}}</ref>\n  \nSigned to [[Okeh Records]] in 1961, Perryman began using the name Dr. Feelgood and the Interns, releasing several hits, including the much-covered \"Doctor Feelgood\".  The persona was one he had initially adopted on his radio shows. The new career was short-lived, though, and Piano Red was never able to regain his former stature.  In 1963, [[The Merseybeats]] recorded a cover of the [[A-side and B-side|b-side]] of \"Doctor Feelgood,\" titled \"[[Mr. Moonlight (song)|Mr. Moonlight]]\" (written by [[Roy Lee Johnson]]) as the B-side of their UK top 5 hit [[I Think Of You]]. It was also recorded by the Beatles and appeared on the album ''[[Beatles for Sale]]'' in the United Kingdom and on the ''[[Beatles '65]]'' album in the United States. In 1966, [[The Lovin' Spoonful]] recorded his song \"Bald Headed Lena\" on their second album, ''[[Daydream (Lovin' Spoonful album)|Daydream]]''.\n\nPerryman continued to be a popular performer in [[Underground Atlanta]], and had several European tours late in his career, including appearances at the [[Montreux Jazz Festival]], [[Berlin Jazz Festival]], Chancellor [[Helmut Schmidt]]'s inauguration, and on [[BBC Radio]]. During this time, he was befriended by Bill Wyman, Keith Richards, Mick Jagger, Eric Clapton, and Paul McCartney, and Pete Ham of Badfinger wrote a song in his honor.\n\nMuhlenbrink's Saloon closed in 1979 and Perryman found himself without a regular job. That lasted until 1981, when he was hired to perform five nights a week at The Excelsior Mill in Atlanta. In 1984, he asked co-owner Michael Reeves to arrange a live recording and Reeves arranged for a mobile recording in October of that year. \n\nIn 1985, Red charted the song \"Yo Yo\", a duet with [[Danny Shirley]], who would later become lead singer of [[Confederate Railroad]].\n\nPerryman was diagnosed with [[cancer]] that same year and died in July 1985 at Dekalb General Hospital in Decatur, Georgia.  Among those who attended his funeral were the [[Governor of Georgia]] and the [[Mayor of Atlanta]].<ref>Liner notes by Norbert Hess for \"The Doctor's In\" (Bear Family; 1993)</ref>\n\nThe tapes from the Excelsior Mill remained in Reeves's possession for twenty-five years. In April 2010, he formed a partnership with author and producer David Fulmer to release a CD of the recording under the title ''The Lost Atlanta Tapes.'' The CD was released by Landslide Records on August 17, 2010.\n\n==Legacy==\n[[Dr. Feelgood]] is a British [[pub rock (UK)|pub rock]] [[musical band|band]] which was formed in 1971. The name of the band, Dr. Feelgood, is [[slang]] for [[heroin]], or for [[physician|doctor]]s who are prepared to overprescribe [[drug]]s. Piano Red's [[song]] \"Dr Feelgood\" was [[cover version|covered]] by several UK beat groups including [[Johnny Kidd & The Pirates]], who used it as the b-side to their 1964 [[single (music)|single]], \"Always and Ever\".<ref name=\"AMG\">{{cite web |first= |last= |url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p4127|pure_url=yes}} |title=Biography by Stephen Thomas Erlewine |publisher=Allmusic.com |accessdate=2008-10-26}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Authority control|VIAF=76514202}}\n{{Persondata         <!-- Metadata: see [[Wikipedia:Persondata]] -->\n| NAME              =Perryman, Willie Lee\n| ALTERNATIVE NAMES =Piano Red\n| SHORT DESCRIPTION =American [[blues]] [[musician]]\n| DATE OF BIRTH     =October 19, 1911\n| PLACE OF BIRTH    =Near [[Hampton, Georgia]], [[United States]]\n| DATE OF DEATH     =July 25, 1985\n| PLACE OF DEATH    =[[Decatur, Georgia]], United States\n}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Perryman, Willie Lee}}\n[[Category:1911 births]]\n[[Category:1985 deaths]]\n[[Category:People with albinism]]\n[[Category:American male singers]]\n[[Category:American blues pianists]]\n[[Category:American blues musicians]]\n[[Category:Groove Records artists]]\n[[Category:RCA Victor artists]]\n[[Category:People from Hampton, Georgia]]\n[[Category:Cancer deaths in Georgia (U.S. state)]]"}]}}}}
