His songs have been used in the [[soundtrack]]s of three films; ''[[Speechless (1994 film)|Speechless]]'', ''[[Hear No Evil (film)|Hear No Evil]]'', and ''[[The Florentine]]''.\n\n==Biography==\nArmstrong's father was a [[jazz]] guitarist and his mother a blues singer. Having learned the guitar at a young age, Armstrong formed his first band at school, and was touring the United States in his late teens. Inspired by [[Albert King]] and [[Robert Cray]], his musical education included backing musicians such as [[Albert Collins]], [[Big Joe Turner]] and [[Smokey Wilson]]. Armstrong relocated to the [[San Francisco Bay Area]] and, in 1995, released his debut album, ''Sleeping with a Stranger'', on HighTone.<ref name=\"AMG\"/>\n\nHowever, in April 1997, Armstrong was almost stabbed to death by an intruder at his home. The shoulder injury necessitated months of rehabilitation, which still left Armstrong with limited guitar playing ability in his left hand. He adjusted his playing style, hired a lead guitar player, and realised that playing [[slide guitar]] helped to slowly recover his dexterity. His second, introspective, album, ''Dark Night'', was issued in 1998.<ref name=\"The Sun\">{{cite news|url=http://mytown.mercurynews.com/archives/sunnyvalesun/03.07.01/armstrong-0110.html |title=The 'Dark Night' returns: Bluesman James Armstrong performs in Sunnyvale nearly four years after he and his son were almost killed|author= Hindin, Daniel|publisher=Mytown.mercurynews.com |accessdate=October 29, 2010}}</ref> It incorporated [[Joe Louis Walker]] and [[Doug Macleod (musician)|Doug Macleod]] playing lead guitar on a couple of the songs.<ref name=\"AMG\"/> The album track, \"Bank of Love\", was used in the films ''[[Hear No Evil (film)|Hear No Evil]]'' and ''[[The Florentine]]''.<ref name=\"James\">{{cite web |url=http://jarmblues.com/press.html |title=James Armstrong biography |author= |publisher=Jamblues.com |accessdate=October 29, 2010}}</ref> \n \nArmstrong recommenced live performances on the blues festival circuit, with a noteworthy appearance at the 1999 Pocono Blues Festival in [[Pennsylvania]]. In early 2000, Armstrong returned to the [[recording studio]] to work on his next album, ''Got It Goin' On''. He was aided in the project by utilising Walker's [[rhythm section]], plus a guest appearance from the keyboardist Jim Pugh.<ref name=\"AMG\"/> In 2001, Armstrong's  song \"Pennies and Picks\" from ''Got It Goin' On'', earned him a [[Blues Music Award|W.C. Handy Award]] nomination for 'Song of the Year'. Armstrong himself was nominated for 'Contemporary Male Blues Guitarist of the Year'.<ref name=\"Search\">{{cite web |url=http://www.bluessearchengine.com/bluesartists/a/jamesarmstrong.html |title=James Armstrong: Got It Goin' On |author= |publisher=Bluessearchengine.com |accessdate=October 29, 2010}}</ref> \"2 Sides,\" another song from ''Got It Goin' On'' was included in the film soundtrack for ''[[Speechless (1994 film)|Speechless]]''.<ref name=\"AMG\"/>\n\nArmstrong has worked with Albert Collins, [[Keb' Mo']], [[Coco Montoya]], [[Roy Brown (blues musician)|Roy Brown]], [[Chaka Khan]], [[Ricky Lee Jones]], [[Jan and Dean]], [[Mitch Mitchell]] and [[Tommy Castro]].<ref name=\"James\"/>\n\nArmstrong's 2011 release on Catfood Records, ''Blues At The Border'', was his first recording in 11 years.\n\n==Critical comments==\n''[[Living Blues]]'':\n\"... With a skintight band and a well-balanced combination of fire, technical  proficiency, and taste, Armstrong continues on his way to the\nupper echelon of contemporary blues artists.\"<ref name=\"James\"/>\n\n[[CBC Radio]]:\n\u201c\u2026full of haunting and subtle nuances that point to a life rich with experience, this musician has definitely paid his dues. James \nplays for and with his audience, extending the reach of the blues to include highly-charged sensuality, yearning, healing and good lowdown fun!\u201d<ref name=\"James\"/>\n\n''[[JazzTimes]]'':\n\"...Demonstrates the kind of flexibility that allows him easily and convincingly shift gears from slow blues... to urban funk... to N\u2019awlins grooves to rousing roadhouse shuffles...\"<ref name=\"James\"/>\n\nTony Russell:\n\"If you define 'blues' by the rigid categories of structure rather than the flexible language of feeling allusion, Robert Cray... Larry Garner, Joe Louis Walker and James Armstrong are a new and uncategorizable breed, their music blues-like rather than blues, each of them blending ideas and devices from a variety of sources &ndash; soul, rock, jazz, gospel &ndash; with a sophisication beyond the reach of their forerunners\".<ref name=\"Russell\">{{cite book\n| first= Tony\n| last= Russell\n| year= 1997\n| title= The Blues: From Robert Johnson to Robert Cray\n| edition= 1st\n| publisher= Carlton Books Limited \n| location= Dubai\n| isbn= 1-85868-255-X\n| page= 4}}</ref>\n\n==Album discography==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Album title\n!Record label\n!Year of release\n|-\n|''Sleeping with a Stranger''\n|[[HighTone Records]]\n|1995\n|-\n|''Dark Night''\n|HighTone Records\n|1998\n|-\n|''Got It Goin' On''\n|HighTone Records\n|2000\n|-\n|''Blues At The Border''\n|Catfood Records\n|2011\n|-\n|}<ref>{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=james-armstrong-p169327/discography|pure_url=yes}} |title=Allmusic ((( James Armstrong > Discography > Main Albums )))}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of soul-blues musicians]]\n*[[List of electric blues musicians]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.jarmblues.com/press.html Official website]\n*[http://users.rcn.com/leclark/James%20Armstrong.html Armstrong photographs at Users.rcn.com]\n\n{{Authority control|VIAF=14170711}}\n\n{{Persondata <!-- Metadata: see [[Wikipedia:Persondata]]. -->\n| NAME              = Armstrong, James\n| ALTERNATIVE NAMES =\n| SHORT DESCRIPTION = [[United States|American]] [[soul blues]] and [[electric blues]] guitarist, singer and songwriter\n| DATE OF BIRTH     = April 22, 1957\n| PLACE OF BIRTH    = [[Los Angeles]], [[California]], [[United States]]\n| DATE OF DEATH     =\n| PLACE OF DEATH    =\n}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Armstrong, James}}\n[[Category:1957 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:American blues guitarists]]\n[[Category:American blues singers]]\n[[Category:American male singers]]\n[[Category:Songwriters from California]]\n[[Category:Soul-blues musicians]]\n[[Category:Electric blues musicians]]\n[[Category:Slide guitarists]]\n[[Category:Musicians from Los Angeles, California]]"}]}}}}
