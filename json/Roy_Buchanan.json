He initially showed talent on [[steel guitar]] before switching to guitar in the early 50s, and started his professional career at age 15, in [[Johnny Otis]]'s rhythm and blues revue.<ref name=\"study\">{{cite news  | last = Harrington  | first = Richard  | title = Roy Buchanan, A Study In Blues; The Gifted Guitarist & His Road Less Traveled  | work = [[The Washington Post]]  | date = 1988-08-21  | url = http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-1274757.html  | accessdate = 2009-04-30}}</ref>\n\nIn 1958, Buchanan made his recording debut with [[Dale Hawkins]], including playing the solo on \"[[My Babe]]\" for Chicago's [[Chess Records]].<ref name=\"carson\"/> Two years later, during a tour through [[Toronto]], Buchanan left Dale Hawkins to play for his cousin [[Ronnie Hawkins]] and tutor Ronnie's guitar player, [[Robbie Robertson]]. Buchanan plays bass on the Ronnie Hawkins single, \"Who Do You Love?\"{{Citation needed|reason=this is mentioned in the booklet that accompanies the Band 6-CD box set|date=February 2010}}.

At the end of the 1960s, with a growing family, Buchanan left the music industry for a while to learn a trade, and trained as a hairdresser.<ref name=\"carson\"/> In the early '70s, Roy Buchanan performed extensively in the Washington D.C.-Maryland-Virginia area with the Danny Denver Band, which had a large following in the area.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}\n\n==Recording career and death==\n\nIn 1961 he released 'Mule Train Stomp', his first single for Swan, featuring rich guitar tones years ahead of their time. Buchanan's 1962 recording with drummer [[Bobby Gregg]], nicknamed \"Potato Peeler,\" first introduced the trademark Buchanan \"pinch\" harmonic. An effort to cash in on the British Invasion caught Buchanan with [[The British Walkers]]. In the mid-'60s, Buchanan settled down in the Washington, D.C., area, playing for Danny Denver's band for many years while acquiring a reputation as \"...one of the very finest rock guitarists around. [[Jimi Hendrix]] would not take up the challenge of a 'pick-off' with Roy.\"<ref>{{cite news  | last = Rockwell  | first = John  | title = Buchanan?

He could never attempt Hendrix's stage show, and this realization refocused him on his own quintessentially American roots-style guitar picking.\"<ref>The life and times of Roy Buchanan By Phil Carson  | [http://www.yee.ch/winter/rbuch_lifetimes.html] | Vintage Guitar | date = August 1999 | accessdate = 2012-04-10</ref>\n\nGossage recalls how Roy was very impressed by the Hendrix 1967 debut album ''[[Are You Experienced?]]'', which was why he made sure to give Roy a ticket to the early show at the Hilton. Gossage went backstage to take photos and tried to convince Jimi to go and see Roy at the Silver Dollar that night after the show, but Jimi seemed more interested in hanging out with the young lady who was backstage with him. Gossage confirms Hendrix never showed up at the Silver Dollar, but he did talk to Roy about seeing the Hilton show. That same night (as the Hilton show) Roy did several Hendrix numbers and \"from that point on, had nothing but good things to say about Hendrix\".<ref>\"American Axe\" By Phil Carson | ISBN 0-87930-639-4, ISBN 978-0-87930-639-7 | accessdate = 2012-04-10</ref> He later released recordings of the Hendrix composition \"[[If 6 Was 9]]\" and the Hendrix hit \"[[Hey Joe]]\".\n\nBuchanan's life changed in 1971, when he gained national notice as the result of an hour-long [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] television documentary. Entitled ''Introducing Roy Buchanan,'' and sometimes mistakenly called ''The Best Unknown Guitarist in the World'', it earned a record deal with [[Polydor Records]] and praise from [[John Lennon]] and [[Merle Haggard]], besides an alleged invitation to join the [[Rolling Stones]] (which he turned down and which gave him the nickname \"the man who tumbled the stones down\").<ref name=\"levy\">{{cite news|last=Levy|first=Adam|title=Rev. of Roy Buchanan, ''Deluxe Edition''/Johnny Winter, ''Deluxe Edition''|accessdate=15 October 2010|newspaper=[[Guitar Player]]|date=May 2001|pages=135\u201336}}</ref> He recorded five albums for Polydor, one of which, ''[[Second Album]]'', went gold,<ref name=\"chicago\">{{cite news  | title = Roy Buchanan, 48; guitarist set new musical standards  | work = [[Chicago Sun-Times]]  | date = 1988-08-16  | url = http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-3899826.html  | accessdate = 2009-04-30}}</ref> and after that another three for [[Atlantic Records]], one of which, 1977's ''[[Loading Zone (album)|Loading Zone]]'', also went gold.<ref name=\"obit\"/><ref name=\"hanged\">{{cite news  | last = Davis\n  | first = Patricia  | coauthors = Sandra Evans  | title = Roy Buchanan, Guitarist, Found Hanged in Va.

He released the twelfth and last album of his career, ''[[Hot Wires]]'', in 1987.\n\nAccording to his agent and others, Buchanan was doing well, having gained control of his drinking habit and playing again, when he was arrested for public intoxication after a domestic dispute.<ref name=\"obit\"/><ref name=\"lesson\"/> He was found hanged from his own shirt in a jail cell on 14 August 1988 in the [[Fairfax County, Virginia|Fairfax County]], Virginia Jail. According to Jerry Hentman, who was in a cell nearby Buchanan's, the Deputy Sheriff opened the door early in the morning and found Buchanan with the shirt around his neck.<ref name=\"carson2\"/><ref name=\"hanged\"/> Buchanan's last show was on August 7, 1988 in [[Guilford, CT]]. His cause of death was officially recorded as [[suicide]], a finding disputed by Buchanan's friends and family.

He himself said that, while enrolled in 1969 in a school to learn to be a hairdresser, he ran after a guy walking down the street with that guitar, and bought him a purple Telecaster to trade. A friend of Buchanan's, however, said that Buchanan was playing a [[Gibson Les Paul]] at the time, and traded it for the '53 Tele.<ref name=\"carson\">{{cite news|last=Carson|first=Phil|title=Roadhouse Wizard: An Exclusive Preview of ''Roy Buchanan, American Axe''|accessdate=15 October 2010|newspaper=[[Guitar Player]]|date=January 2002|pages=102\u2013106}}</ref> One of Buchanan's Telecasters was later owned by [[Danny Gatton]] and [[Mike Stern]], who lost it in a robbery.<ref>{{cite news|last=Gold|first=Jude|title=Mike Stern|accessdate=15 October 2010|newspaper=[[Guitar Player]]|date=June 2007|pages=28\u201330}}</ref>\n\n===Tone===\nBuchanan achieved his sound through minimum means.

He sometimes used his thumb nail rather than a [[guitar pick|plectrum]], and also employed it to augment his index finger and pick. Holding the pick between his thumb and forefinger, Buchanan also plucked the string and simultaneously touched it lightly with the lower edge of his thumb at one of the harmonic nodes, thus suppressing lower overtones and emphasising the harmonic, sometimes referred to as [[pinch harmonic]]s,<ref name=\"balmer\"/> though Buchanan called it an \"overtone.\"<ref name=\"lesson\"/> Buchanan could play harmonics at will, and could mute individual strings with free right-hand fingers while picking or pinching others. He was famous as well for his oblique bends.<ref>{{cite news|last=Ellis|first=Andy|title=Lead Guitar 101: Wrenching Triple-String Oblique Bends|accessdate=15 October 2010|newspaper=[[Guitar Player]]|date=May 2005|page=39}}</ref>\n\nHaving first played [[lap steel]] guitar, Buchanan often imitated its effect and bent strings to the required pitch, rather than starting on the desired note.<ref name=\"lesson\"/><ref name=\"balmer\"/> This was particularly notable in his approach to using [[double stop|double]] and [[triple stop]]s.\n\n==Legacy==\nBuchanan has influenced many guitarists, including [[Gary Moore]],<ref>{{cite news|last=Fox|first=Darrin|title=Gary Moore|accessdate=15 October 2010|newspaper=[[Guitar Player]]|date=October 2007|pages=66\u201372}}</ref> [[Danny Gatton]], and [[Jeff Beck]];<ref name=\"fox\">{{cite news|last=Fox|first=Darrin|title=Oeuvre Easy: Roy Buchanan|accessdate=15 October 2010|newspaper=[[Guitar Player]]|date=November 2005|page=44}}</ref> Beck dedicated his version of \"Cause We've Ended As Lovers\" from ''[[Blow by Blow]]'' to him.<ref>{{cite news|last=Blackett|first=Matt|title=Pure Genius: Guitar's Magnificent Rebel Puts a Twist on Techno|accessdate=15 October 2010|newspaper=[[Guitar Player]]|date=December 2000|pages=98\u2013106}}</ref> His work is said to \"stretch the limits of the electric guitar,\"<ref name=\"chicago\"/> and he is praised for \"his subtlety of tone and the breadth of his knowledge, from the blackest of blues to moaning R&B and clean, concise, bone-deep rock 'n' roll.\"<ref>{{cite news  | last = Zibart  | first = Eve  | title = No Slickee, No Stoppee  | work = [[The Washington Post]]  | page = N21  | date = 1988-08-19  | accessdate = 2009-04-30}}</ref> \nIn 2004, ''[[Guitar Player]]'' listed his version of \"Sweet Dreams,\" from his debut album on Polydor, ''[[Roy Buchanan (album)|Roy Buchanan]]'', as having one of the \"50 Greatest Tones of All Time.\"<ref name=\"tones\"/> In the same year, the readers of ''Guitar Player'' voted Buchanan #46 in a top 50 readers' poll.<ref>{{cite news|last=Molenda|first=Michael|title=The 2004 ''Guitar Player'' Readers Poll|accessdate=15 October 2010|newspaper=[[Guitar Player]]|date=March 2004|pages=58\u201362}}</ref> Roy is the subject of Freddy Blohm's song \"King of a Small Room.\"\n\nRoy Buchanan is interred at [[Columbia Gardens Cemetery]] in [[Arlington, Virginia]].\n\n==Discography==\n\n=== Studio albums ===\n*''[[Buch and the Snakestretchers]]'', 1971, BIOYA (homemade and self-produced)\n*''[[Roy Buchanan (album)|Roy Buchanan]]'', 1972, Polydor\n*''[[Second Album (Roy Buchanan album)|Second Album]]'', 1973, Polydor\n*''[[That's What I Am Here For]]'', 1974, Polydor\n*''[Rescue Me]\",1974, Polydor\n*''[[In the Beginning (Roy Buchanan album)|In the Beginning]]'' (UK title: ''Rescue Me''), 1974, Polydor\n*''[[A Street Called Straight]]'', 1976, Atlantic\n*''[[Loading Zone (album)|Loading Zone]]'', 1977, Atlantic\n*''[[You're Not Alone (Roy Buchanan album)|You're Not Alone]]'', 1978, Atlantic\n*''[[My Babe (Roy Buchanan album)|My Babe]]'', 1981, AJK\n*''[[When a Guitar Plays the Blues]]'', 1985, Alligator\n*''[[Dancing on the Edge (1986 Buchanan album)|Dancing on the Edge]]'', 1986, Alligator\n*''[[Hot Wires]]'', 1987, Alligator\n\n=== Live albums ===\n*''[[Live Stock]]'', 1975, Polydor\n*''[[Live in Japan -
