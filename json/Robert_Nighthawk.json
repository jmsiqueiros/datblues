He is the father of blues musician [[Sam Carr (musician)|Sam Carr]].\n\n==Life and career==\nBorn in [[Helena, Arkansas]], he left home at an early age to become a busking musician, and after a period wandering through southern [[Mississippi]], settled for a time in [[Memphis, Tennessee]], where he played with local orchestras and musicians, such as the [[Memphis Jug Band]]. A particular influence during this period was [[Houston Stackhouse]], from whom he learned to play [[slide guitar]], and with whom he appeared on the radio in [[Jackson, Mississippi]].\n\nAfter further travels through Mississippi, he found it advisable to take his mother's name, and as Robert Lee McCoy moved to [[St. Louis, Missouri]], in the mid-1930s.<ref name=\"russell\"/> Local musicians with whom he played included [[Henry Townsend (musician)|Henry Townsend]], [[Big Joe Williams]], and [[Sonny Boy Williamson I|Sonny Boy Williamson]]. This led to two recording dates in 1937, the four musicians recording together at the [[Victor Records]] studio in [[Aurora, Illinois]], as well as recordings under his own name, including \"Prowling Night-Hawk\" (recorded 5 May 1937), from which he was to take his later pseudonym.\n\nThese sessions led to [[Chicago blues]] careers for the other musicians, though not, however, for McCoy, who continued his rambling life, playing and recording (for Victor/[[Bluebird Records|Bluebird]] and [[Decca Records|Decca]]) solo and with various musicians, under various names. He also became a familiar voice on local radio stations; then Robert Lee McCoy disappeared.\n\nWithin a few years, he resurfaced as the electric [[slide guitar]]ist Robert Nighthawk, and began recording for [[Aristocrat Records|Aristocrat]] and [[Chess Records]], the latter of which was also [[Muddy Waters]]' label; in 1949 and 1950, the two men's styles were close enough that they were in competition for promotional activity; as Waters was the more marketable commodity, being more reliable and a more confident stage communicator, he received the attention. Though Nighthawk continued to perform and to record, taking up with [[United Records|United]] and [[States Records|States]] 1951 and 1952, he failed to achieve great commercial success.\n\nIn 1963, Nighthawk was rediscovered busking in Chicago and this led to further recording sessions and club dates, and to his return to Arkansas, where he appeared on the [[King Biscuit Time]] radio programme on [[KFFA (AM)|KFFA]]. Nighthawk continued giving live performances on Chicago's [[Maxwell Street]] until 1964.<ref name=\"russell\">{{cite book\n| first= Tony\n| last= Russell\n| year= 1997\n| title= The Blues: From Robert Johnson to Robert Cray\n| edition= \n| publisher= Carlton Books Limited \n| location= Dubai\n| page= 150\n| isbn= 1-85868-255-X}}</ref> He had a [[stroke]] followed by a heart attack, and died of [[heart failure]]<ref name=\"Dead\"/> at his home in Helena.\n\n==Historic marker==\n\n[[File:Robert nighthawk btm.jpg|thumb|Robert Nighthawk Blues Trail Marker]]\n\nNighthawk was honored by the Mississippi Blues Commission places a historic marker in [[Friars Point, Mississippi]], marking his position on the [[Mississippi Blues Trail]].
