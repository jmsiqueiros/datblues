His parents soon separated with his mother re-marrying, leaving the young Lawhorn cared for by his grandparents.<ref name=\"Cascade\"/> Nailing some [[baling twine]] to the side of their home he made his own [[diddley bow]].  Frequently visiting his mother and stepfather in [[Chicago]], they bought him a [[ukulele]] to play, followed in turn by an [[acoustic guitar|acoustic]] and finally [[electric guitar]].<ref name=\"AMG\"/> By the age of fifteen, Lawhorn was proficient enough to accompany [[Driftin' Slim]] on stage, and with further guidance from [[Sonny Boy Williamson II]], began playing with him on the [[King Biscuit Time]] radio program.<ref name=\"AMG\"/><ref name=\"Cascade\"/>\n\nLawhorn was conscripted in 1953 and served in the United States Navy where, on a tour of duty in Korea, he was injured by enemy fire during aerial reconnaissance.  He continued in service and was discharged in 1958, when he moved to [[Memphis, Tennessee]]. There he undertook recording sessions with [[The \"5\" Royales]], [[Eddie Boyd]], [[Roy Brown (blues musician)|Roy Brown]] and [[Willie Cobbs]].  An argument arose with the latter over the writing credits for the song \"[[You Don't Love Me (Willie Cobbs song)|You Don't Love Me]].\" Finding work on his own in Chicago in 1958, Lawhorn soon relocated, despite having a guitar stolen at one of his early club performances.<ref name=\"AMG\"/><ref name=\"Cascade\"/>\n\nBy the early 1960s, Lawhorn had found regular work as a club [[sideman]] to [[Junior Wells]], [[Otis Rush]] and [[Elmore James]], which led to him sitting in with [[Muddy Waters]] band on a couple of occasions. By October 1964, Lawhorn was invited to join the Muddy Waters band on a full-time basis. Over the next decade, he subsequently played on a number of Muddy Waters' albums including ''Live At Mister Kelly's,'' ''The London Muddy Waters Sessions,'' ''The Woodstock Album,'' and ''[[Folk Singer]]''.<ref name=\"AMG\"/><ref name=\"Cascade\"/>\n\nLawhorn's guitar work also featured when Muddy Waters' band supplied backing to [[John Lee Hooker]], [[Big Mama Thornton]] and [[Otis Spann]].  Lawhorn's use of the [[tremolo arm]] on his guitar, and his overall playing expertise, saw him later credited by Muddy Waters as the best guitarist he ever had in his band.  However, Lawhorn's career started to be hampered by his drinking. Passing out on stage over his amplifier, off stage whilst sitting in clubs, or missing shows altogether, led to Muddy Waters losing patience and firing Lawhorn in 1973. He was replaced by [[Bob Margolin]].<ref name=\"AMG\"/><ref name=\"Cascade\"/>\n\nLawson simply returned to playing in Chicago clubs, and remained in the recording industry with appearances on [[Junior Wells]]' ''On Tap'', plus [[James Cotton]]'s ''Take Me Back'' (1987). He also supplied his guitar skills to recorded work by [[Koko Taylor]], [[Jimmy Witherspoon]], [[Little Mack Simmons]], and [[L. C. Robinson]].  His work in several Chicago haunts saw him play alongside his childhood idols in [[T-Bone Walker]] and [[Lightnin' Hopkins]].  Assistance proffered by Lawhorn to up and coming musicians of the time saw [[John Primer]] become a disciple.<ref name=\"AMG\"/><ref name=\"Cascade\"/>\n\nA combination of alcoholism and arthritis started to cause Lawhorn's health to fail. The latter was contributed to when he was thrown from a third floor window by a burglar, breaking both his feet and ankles.<ref name=\"AMG\"/><ref name=\"Cascade\"/>\n\nLawhorn died in April 1990 at the age of 54 with his death certificate citing [[death by natural causes|natural causes]].<ref name=\"Cascade\">{{cite web|url=http://www.cascadeblues.org/History/SammyLawhorn.htm|title=Sammy Lawhorn|author=Johnson, Greg|publisher=Cascadeblues.org|accessdate=August 2, 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Selected discography==\nThe following list represents a range of album recordings that featured Lawhorn's guitar work:\n*''[[Folk Singer]]'' (1964) - [[Muddy Waters]]\n*''Blues is Where It's At'' (1966) - [[Otis Spann]]\n*''Live at the Caf\u00e9 Au Go-Go'' (1966) - [[John Lee Hooker]]\n*''The Bluesmen of the Muddy Waters Chicago Blues Band'' (1966) - Various\n*''Big Mama Thornton with the Muddy Waters Blues Band'' (1966) - [[Big Mama Thornton]] and Muddy Waters\n*''Brass and the Blues'' (1967) - Muddy Waters\n*''The Bluesmen of the Muddy Waters Blues Band, Volume 2'' (1968) - Various\n*''Ball 'n' Chain'' (1968) - Big Mama Thornton\n*''They Call Me Muddy Waters'' (1970) - Muddy Waters\n*''I Got What It Takes'' (1975) - [[Koko Taylor]]\n*''On Tap'' (1975) - [[Junior Wells]]\n*''[[Live at Theresa's 1975]]'' (1975) - Junior Wells\n*''Spoon's Life'' (1980) - [[Jimmy Witherspoon]]\n*''My Soul is Blue'' (1980) - [[Johnny Dollar (blues musician)|Johnny Dollar]]\n*''Take Me Back'' (1987) - [[James Cotton]] Blues Band<ref name=\"Albums\">{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/sammy-lawhorn-mn0000834521/credits |title=Sammy Lawhorn &#124; Credits |publisher=AllMusic |date= |accessdate=2014-01-28}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wirz.de/music/smitgfrm.htm|title=Sammy Lawhorn discography|publisher=Wirz.de|accessdate=2014-01-28}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of Chicago blues musicians]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Authority control|VIAF=74038070}}\n{{Persondata <!-- Metadata: see [[Wikipedia:Persondata]]. -->\n| NAME              = Lawhorn, Sammy\n| ALTERNATIVE NAMES = \n| SHORT DESCRIPTION = [[United States|American]] [[Chicago blues]] guitarist\n| DATE OF BIRTH     = July 12, 1935\n| PLACE OF BIRTH    = [[Little Rock, Arkansas]], United States\n| DATE OF DEATH     = April 29, 1990\n| PLACE OF DEATH    = [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]], United States\n}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Lawhorn, Sammy}}\n[[Category:1935 births]]\n[[Category:1990 deaths]]\n[[Category:American blues guitarists]]\n[[Category:American blues musicians]]\n[[Category:Soul-blues musicians]]\n[[Category:Electric blues musicians]]\n[[Category:Chicago blues musicians]]\n[[Category:American session musicians]]\n[[Category:Musicians from Little Rock, Arkansas]]"}]}}}}
