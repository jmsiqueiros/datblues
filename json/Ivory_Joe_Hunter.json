After a series of hits on the US [[R&B chart]] starting in the mid-1940s, he became more widely known for his hit recording, \"[[Since I Met You Baby (song)|Since I Met You Baby]]\" (1956). He was billed as '''The Baron of the Boogie''', and also known as '''The Happiest Man Alive'''. His musical output ranged from R&B to [[blues]], [[boogie-woogie]], and [[country music|country]], and Hunter made a name in all of those genres. Uniquely, he was honored at the [[Monterey Jazz Festival]] and the [[Grand Ole Opry]].<ref name=\"russell\">{{cite book\n| first= Tony\n| last= Russell\n| year= 1997\n| title= The Blues: From Robert Johnson to Robert Cray\n| edition=\n| publisher= Carlton Books Limited\n| location= Dubai\n| page= 121\n| isbn= 1-85868-255-X}}</ref>\n\n==Early years==\nHunter was born in [[Kirbyville, Texas]], [[United States]].
