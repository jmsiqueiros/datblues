He started working in cotton fields at age five, singing along with his family while working. The family farm was flooded on at least two occasions, which later inspired him to write the song \"Five Feet High and Rising\".{{Sfn | Cash | Carr | 1997}}{{Rp|needed=y|date=December 2012}} His family's economic and personal struggles during the [[Great Depression]] inspired many of his songs, especially those about other people facing similar difficulties.\n\nCash was very close to his older brother, Jack.<ref>{{Citation | publisher = Find a grave | url = http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&GRid=19397312 | title = Jack D. Cash}}</ref> In May 1944, Jack was pulled into a whirling [[head saw]] in the mill where he worked and was almost cut in two. He suffered for over a week before he died on May 20, 1944, at age 15.{{Sfn | Cash | Carr | 1997}}{{Rp | needed=y|date=December 2012}} Cash often spoke of the horrible guilt he felt over this incident. According to ''Cash: The Autobiography'', his father was away that morning, but he and his mother, and Jack himself, all had premonitions or a sense of foreboding about that day, causing his mother to urge Jack to skip work and go fishing with his brother. Jack insisted on working, as the family needed the money. On his deathbed, Jack said he had visions of heaven and angels. Decades later, Cash spoke of looking forward to meeting his brother in heaven.\n\nCash's early memories were dominated by [[gospel music]] and radio. Taught guitar by his mother and a childhood friend, Cash began playing and writing songs at the age of twelve. When Cash was young, he had a high tenor voice, before becoming a bass-baritone.<ref>Gross, Terry (2004). \u00a0A man's voice. \u00a0''All I did was ask: \u00a0Conversations with writers, actors, musicians, and artists''\u00a0(p. 31). \u00a0New York, NY: \u00a0Hyperion.</ref>  In high school he sang on a local radio station; decades later he released an album of traditional gospel songs, called ''[[My Mother's Hymn Book]]''.

They dated for three weeks, until Cash was deployed to Germany for a three-year tour. During that time, the couple exchanged hundreds of pages of [[love letter]]s.{{Sfn | Turner | 2004 | pp = 43\u20134}} On August 7, 1954, one month after his discharge, they were married at St. Ann's Catholic church in San Antonio. The ceremony was performed by her uncle, Father Vincent Liberto. They had four daughters: [[Rosanne Cash|Rosanne]], Kathy, Cindy and Tara. Liberto stated that Cash's drug and alcohol abuse as well as constant touring, affairs with other women, and his close relationship with [[June Carter Cash|June Carter]] led her to file for divorce in 1966.\n\nCash's career was handled by Saul Holiff, a London promoter and this relationship was the subject of Saul's son's biopic ''[[My Father and the Man in Black]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://johnny-and-saul.com/ |title=Home &#124; My Father and The Man In Black |publisher=Johnny-and-saul.com |accessdate=2014-04-25}}</ref>\n\nIn 1968, 13 years after they first met backstage at the [[Grand Ole Opry]], Cash proposed to June Carter, of the famed [[Carter Family]], during a live performance in [[London, Ontario]].<ref>{{Citation | place = UK | last = Sweeting | first = Adam | date = September 12, 2003 | url = http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/2003/sep/12/johnnycash | type = obituary | title = Johnny Cash | newspaper = [[The Guardian]]; London |accessdate=January 26, 2009}}</ref>  The couple married on March 1, 1968, in [[Franklin, Kentucky]].

Cash died four months later.\n\n=== Heritage ===\n\nCash researched his heritage and found a mix of mostly Scottish and English ancestry. He learned, upon researching his paternal heritage, that he was of [[Scottish American|Scottish]] royal descent, traced back to [[Malcolm IV of Scotland]].<ref name = Millar>{{Citation | last = Millar | first = Anna | date = June 4, 2006 | url = http://heritage.scotsman.com/people/Celtic-connection-as-Cash-walks.2781119.jp | title = Celtic connection as Cash walks the line in Fife | newspaper = Scotland on Sunday | publisher = Scotsman | accessdate = April 12, 2011}}</ref><ref name= Memoir1>{{Cite book | last = Cash | first = Roseanne | title = Composed a memoir| publisher= [[Viking Press]]; [[Penguin Group]] | year = 2010 | isbn = 978-1-101-45769-6}}</ref><ref name= Manzoor>{{Citation | last = Manzoor | first = Sarfraz | date = February 7, 2010 | url = http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2010/feb/07/johnny-cash-scottish-roots | title = Scottish roots of Johnny Cash, the man in black tartan | publisher = The Guardian | accessdate = April 12, 2011 | location=London, UK}}</ref> After meeting with the then [[laird]] of [[Falkland, Fife]], Major Michael Crichton-Stuart, Johnny traced the Cash family tree to eleventh-century [[Fife]].{{Sfn | Miller | 2003 | p = 11}}<ref>{{Citation | last = Dalton | first = Stephanie | date = January 15, 2006 | url = http://heritage.scotsman.com/people.cfm?id=66542006 | title = Walking the line back in time | newspaper = Scotland on Sunday | publisher = Scotsman | accessdate = June 28, 2007}}</ref>{{Sfn | Cash | Carr | 1997 | p = 3}} Cash [[Loch]] and other locations in [[Fife]] bear the name of his family.{{Sfn | Miller | 2003 | p = 11}}\n\nThough he did not have Native American ancestry, his empathy and compassion for Native Americans were unabated. These feelings were expressed in several of his songs, including \"Apache Tears\" and \"[[The Ballad of Ira Hayes]]\", and on his album, ''[[Bitter Tears: Ballads of the American Indian]]''.\n\n== Career ==\n\n=== Early career ===\n[[File:Johnny Cash Sun Records promotional portrait.jpg|thumb|right|Publicity photo for Sun Records]]\nIn 1954, Cash and Vivian moved to [[Memphis, Tennessee]], where he sold appliances while studying to be a radio announcer. At night he played with guitarist [[Luther Perkins]] and bassist [[Marshall Grant]]. Perkins and Grant were known as the [[The Tennessee Three|Tennessee Two]]. Cash worked up the courage to visit the [[Sun Records]] studio, hoping to get a recording contract. After auditioning for [[Sam Phillips]], singing mostly gospel songs, Phillips told him that he didn't record gospel music any longer. It was once rumored that Phillips told Cash to \"go home and sin, then come back with a song I can sell,\" though in a 2002 interview Cash denied that Phillips made any such comment.<ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=832786 | title = The Man in Black's Musical Journey Continues | accessdate = February 9, 2010 | publisher = NPR}}</ref> Cash eventually won over the producer with new songs delivered in his early rock'a'billy style. In 1955, Cash made his first recordings at Sun, \"[[Hey Porter]]\" and \"[[Cry! Cry! Cry!]]\", which were released in late June and met with success on the country [[hit parade]].\n\nOn December 4, 1956, [[Elvis Presley]] dropped in on Phillips while [[Carl Perkins]] was in the studio cutting new tracks, with [[Jerry Lee Lewis]] backing him on piano. Cash was also in the studio and the four started an [[impromptu]] [[jam session]]. Phillips left the tapes running and the recordings, almost half of which were gospel songs, survived and have since been released under the title ''[[Million Dollar Quartet]]''. In ''Cash: the Autobiography'', Cash wrote that he was the one farthest from the microphone and was singing in a higher pitch to blend in with Elvis.\n\nCash's next record, \"Folsom Prison Blues\", made the country Top 5, and \"[[I Walk the Line]]\" became No. 1 on the country charts and entered the pop charts Top 20. \"[[Home of the Blues]]\" followed, recorded in July 1957. That same year Cash became the first Sun artist to release a [[LP record|long-playing album]]. Although he was Sun's most consistently selling and prolific artist at that time, Cash felt constrained by his contract with the small label partly due to the fact that Phillips wasn't keen on Johnny recording gospel, and he was only getting a 3% royalty as opposed to the standard rate of 5%. Presley had already left Sun, and Phillips was focusing most of his attention and promotion on Lewis. The following year Cash left the label to sign a lucrative offer with [[Columbia Records]], where his single \"[[Don't Take Your Guns to Town]]\" became one of his biggest hits.\n\nIn the early 1960s, Cash toured with the [[Carter Family]], which by this time regularly included [[Maybelle Carter|Mother Maybelle]]'s daughters, [[Anita Carter|Anita]], [[June Carter Cash|June]] and [[Helen Carter|Helen]]. June later recalled admiring him from afar during these tours.\n\nIn the 1960s he appeared on [[Pete Seeger]]'s short lived television series ''[[Rainbow Quest]]''.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.richardandmimi.com/rainbowquest.html |title=Rainbow Quest |publisher=Richard & Mimi |date = February 26, 1966 |accessdate=August 1, 2012}}</ref> He also acted in and wrote and sang the opening theme for a 1961 film entitled ''[[Five Minutes to Live]]'', later re-released as ''Door-to-door Maniac''.\n\n=== Outlaw image ===\nAs his career was taking off in the late 1950s, Cash started drinking heavily and became addicted to [[amphetamine]]s and [[barbiturate]]s. For a brief time, he shared an apartment in Nashville with [[Waylon Jennings]], who was heavily addicted to amphetamines. Cash used the uppers to stay awake during tours. Friends joked about his \"nervousness\" and erratic behavior, many ignoring the warning signs of his worsening [[drug addiction]]. In a behind-the-scenes look at ''[[The Johnny Cash Show (TV series)|The Johnny Cash Show]]'', Cash claims to have \"tried every drug there was to try.\"\n\nAlthough he was in many ways spiraling out of control, Cash's frenetic creativity was still delivering hits. His rendition of \"[[Ring of Fire (song)|Ring of Fire]]\" was a [[crossover (music)|crossover]] hit, reaching No. 1 on the country charts and entering the Top 20 on the pop charts. The song was written by [[June Carter Cash|June Carter]] and [[Merle Kilgore]]. The song was originally performed by June's sister, but the signature [[mariachi]]-style horn arrangement was provided by Cash,<ref name=pc10>{{Pop Chronicles |10 |3}}</ref> who said that it had come to him in a dream.  Vivian Liberto claims a different version of the origins of \"Ring of Fire\".  In her book, ''I Walked the Line: My Life with Johnny'', Liberto states that Cash gave Carter the credit for monetary reasons.<ref>Liberto, ''I Walked the Line: My Life with Johnny'', p. 294.</ref>\n\nIn June 1965, his truck caught fire due to an overheated wheel bearing, triggering a forest fire that burnt several hundred acres in [[Los Padres National Forest]] in California.<ref>\"Major brush fire.\" ''Los Angeles Times'', June 28, 1965, p. 1.</ref><ref>\"Control of Brush Fire Near; 700 Acres Burned.\" ''Los Angeles Times'', June 29, 1965, p. 27.</ref> When the judge asked Cash why he did it, Cash said, \"I didn't do it, my truck did, and it's dead, so you can't question it.\"{{Sfn | Cash | Carr | 1997}}{{Rp | needed = yes| date=December 2012}} The fire destroyed {{convert |508|acre|ha}}, burning the foliage off three mountains and driving off 49 of the refuge's 53 endangered [[California Condor|condors]].<ref>Johnson, Brett (November 18, 2007), [http://www.vcstar.com/news/2007/nov/18/they-walked-the-line/ \"Cash's first wife tells of romance, heartbreak\"], ''Ventura County Star.'' Retrieved July 9, 2013.</ref> Cash was unrepentant and claimed, \"I don't care about your damn yellow buzzards.\"  The federal government sued him and was awarded $125,172 (${{Inflation |US|125,172|1965|r=0}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}} dollars). Cash eventually [[Settlement (law)|settled]] the case and paid $82,001.<ref>Williford, Stanley and Howard Hertel. \"Singer Johnny Cash Pays $82,000 to U.S. in Fire Case.\" ''Los Angeles Times'', Jul 3, 1969, p.

Despite landing in jail seven times for [[misdemeanor]]s, each stay lasted only a single night. His most infamous run-in with the law occurred while on tour in 1965, when he was arrested October 4 by a [[narcotic]]s squad in [[El Paso, Texas|El Paso]], Texas. The officers suspected that he was [[smuggling]] heroin from Mexico, but found instead 688 [[Dexedrine]] capsules and 475 [[Meprobamate|Equanil]] tablets that the singer had hidden inside his guitar case. Because the pills were prescription drugs rather than illegal narcotics, he received a [[suspended sentence]].\n[[File:JohnnyCashJuneCarterCash1969.jpg|thumb|left|Johnny Cash and his second wife, [[June Carter Cash|June Carter]]]]\nCash had also been arrested on May 11, 1965, in [[Starkville, Mississippi]], for [[trespassing]] late at night onto private property to pick flowers. (This incident gave the spark for the song \"Starkville City Jail\", which he spoke about on his live ''At San Quentin'' prison album.)\n\nIn the mid-1960s, Cash released a number of [[concept album]]s, including ''[[Sings the Ballads of the True West]]'' (1965), an experimental double record mixing authentic frontier songs with Cash's spoken narration, and ''[[Bitter Tears]]'' (1964), with songs highlighting the plight of the Native Americans. His drug addiction was at its worst at this point, and his destructive behavior led to a divorce from his first wife and canceled performances.\n\nIn 1967, Cash's duet with [[June Carter Cash|June Carter]], \"[[Jackson (song)|Jackson]]\", won a [[Grammy Award]].\n\nJohnny Cash's final arrest was in 1967 in [[Walker County, Georgia]], where he was taken in after being involved in a car accident while carrying a bag of prescription pills. Cash attempted to bribe a local deputy, who turned the money down, and then spent the night in a [[LaFayette, Georgia]], jail. The singer was released after a long talk with Sheriff Ralph Jones, who warned him of his dangerous behavior and wasted potential. Cash credited that experience for saving his life, and he later came back to LaFayette to play a benefit concert that attracted 12,000 people (the city population was less than 9,000 at the time) and raised $75,000 for the high school.<ref>{{Citation | page = 5A | place = LaFayette, [[Georgia (U.S. state)|GA]], | url = http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=KtkvAAAAIBAJ&sjid=sjEDAAAAIBAJ&pg=3615,6191621 | newspaper = Rome News Tribune | date = August 14, 1970 | publisher = Google News | title = 12 000 at LaFayette show}}</ref>  Reflecting on his past in a 1997 interview, Cash noted:  \u201cI was taking the pills for awhile, and then the pills started taking me.\"<ref>Gross, Terry (2004). \u00a0A man's voice. \u00a0''All I did was ask: \u00a0Conversations with writers, actors,musicians, and artists''\u00a0(p. 34). \u00a0New York, NY: \u00a0Hyperion.</ref>\n\nCash curtailed his use of drugs for several years in 1968, after a spiritual [[wikt:epiphany|epiphany]] in the [[Nickajack Cave]], when he attempted to commit suicide while under the heavy influence of drugs. He descended deeper into the cave, trying to lose himself and \"just die\", when he passed out on the floor. He reported being exhausted and feeling at the end of his rope when he felt God's presence in his heart and managed to struggle out of the cave (despite the exhaustion) by following a faint light and slight breeze. To him, it was his own rebirth. June, [[Maybelle Carter|Maybelle]], and Ezra Carter moved into Cash's mansion for a month to help him conquer his addiction. Cash proposed onstage to June at a concert at the [[London Gardens]] in [[London, Ontario|London]], Ontario, on February 22, 1968; the couple married a week later (on March 1) in [[Franklin, Kentucky|Franklin]], Kentucky.

However, beginning in 1970, Cash ended all drug use for a period of seven years. Grant claims that the birth of Cash's son, [[John Carter Cash]], inspired Cash to end his dependence. Cash began using amphetamines again in 1977. By 1983, he was once again addicted, and entered the [[Betty Ford Clinic]] in [[Rancho Mirage, California|Rancho Mirage]], California for rehabilitation. Cash managed to stay off drugs for several years, but by 1989, he was dependent again and entered Nashville's Cumberland Heights Alcohol and Drug Treatment Center. In 1992, he entered the Loma Linda Behavioural Medicine Centre in [[Loma Linda, California]] for his final rehabilitation (several months later, his son followed him into this facility for treatment).<ref name = Grant>{{cite book | last = Grant | first = Marshall | title = I Was There When It Happened&nbsp;\u2013 My Life With Johnny Cash | publisher = Cumberland House | year = 2005 | isbn= 1-58182-510-2}}</ref><ref name = \"John Carter Cash\">{{cite book | last =Cash |first= John Carter | title= Anchored In Love |publisher= Thomas Nelson | year = 2007 | isbn= 0-8499-0187-1}}</ref><ref>{{Citation | title = Cash In Treatment | newspaper = Orlando Sentinel | date =November 26, 1989}}</ref>\n\n=== Folsom Prison Blues ===\nCash felt great compassion for prisoners. He began performing concerts at prisons starting in the late 1950s. His first prison concert was on January 1, 1959 at San Quentin State Prison.<ref name=\"cash1958\">[http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/inmate-merle-haggard-hears-johnny-cash-play-san-quentin-state-prison \"Inmate Merle Haggard hears Johnny Cash play San Quentin State Prison\"],</ref> These performances led to a pair of highly successful live albums, ''[[At Folsom Prison|Johnny Cash at Folsom Prison]]'' (1968) and ''[[At San Quentin|Johnny Cash at San Quentin]]'' (1969).\n\nThe [[Folsom State Prison|Folsom Prison]] record was introduced by a rendition of his \"Folsom Prison Blues\", while the [[San Quentin]] record included the crossover hit single \"[[A Boy Named Sue]]\", a [[Shel Silverstein]]-penned novelty song that reached No. 1 on the country charts and No. 2 on the U.S. [[Top 40|Top Ten]] pop charts. The AM versions of the latter contained profanities which were edited out. The modern CD versions are unedited and thus also longer than the original vinyl albums, though they retain the audience reaction overdubs of the originals.\n\nCash performed at the [[\u00d6ster\u00e5ker Prison]] in Sweden in 1972. The live album ''[[P\u00e5 \u00d6ster\u00e5ker]]'' (\"At \u00d6ster\u00e5ker\") was released in 1973. \"San Quentin\" was recorded with Cash replacing \"San Quentin\" with \"\u00d6ster\u00e5ker\".\n\n=== \"The Man in Black\" ===\n[[File:Johnny Cash-Nixon.jpg|thumb|250px|Cash advocated [[prison reform]] at his July 1972 meeting with United States President [[Richard Nixon]]]]\nFrom 1969 to 1971, Cash starred in his own television show, ''[[The Johnny Cash Show (TV series)|The Johnny Cash Show]]'', on the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] network. [[The Statler Brothers]] opened up for him in every episode; the Carter Family and rockabilly legend [[Carl Perkins]] were also part of the regular show entourage. Cash also enjoyed booking mainstream performers as guests; including [[Neil Young]], [[Louis Armstrong]], [[Kenny Rogers and The First Edition]] (who appeared a record four times), [[James Taylor]], [[Ray Charles]], [[Roger Miller]], [[Derek and the Dominos]], and [[Bob Dylan]]. During the same period, he contributed the title song and other songs to the film ''Little Fauss and Big Halsey'', which starred Robert Redford, Michael J. Pollard, and Lauren Hutton. The title song, ''The Ballad of Little Fauss and Big Halsey'', written by Carl Perkins, was nominated for a Golden Globe award.\n\nCash had met with Dylan in the mid-1960s and became closer friends when they were neighbors in the late 1960s in [[Woodstock, New York]]. Cash was enthusiastic about reintroducing the reclusive Dylan to his audience. Cash sang a duet with Dylan on Dylan's country album ''[[Nashville Skyline]]'' and also wrote the album's [[Grammy]]-winning [[liner notes]].\n\nAnother artist who received a major career boost from ''The Johnny Cash Show'' was [[Kris Kristofferson]], who was beginning to make a name for himself as a singer/songwriter. During a live performance of Kristofferson's \"[[Sunday Mornin' Comin' Down]]\", Cash refused to change the lyrics to suit network executives, singing the song with its references to [[cannabis (drug)|marijuana]] intact:\n<poem>On a Sunday morning sidewalk\nI'm wishin', Lord, that I was stoned.<ref>{{Citation | title = The Best of the Johnny Cash TV Show 1969\u20131971 | volume = Disc 1 (of 2) | publisher = Reverse Angle Production | year = 2007}}</ref></poem>\n\nBy the early 1970s, he had crystallized his public image as \"The Man in Black\". He regularly performed dressed all in black, wearing a long black knee-length coat. This outfit stood in contrast to the costumes worn by most of the major country acts in his day: [[rhinestone]] suits and [[cowboy boots]]. In 1971, Cash wrote the song \"[[Man in Black (song)|Man in Black]]\", to help explain his dress code:\n<poem>We're doing mighty fine I do suppose\nIn our streak of lightning cars and fancy clothes\nBut just so we're reminded of the ones who are held back\nUp front there ought to be a man in black.</poem>\n\n[[File:Johnny-Cash 1972.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Cash performing in [[Bremen]], Northern Germany, in September 1972]]\nHe wore black on behalf of the [[Poverty|poor]] and [[Hunger|hungry]], on behalf of \"the prisoner who has long paid for his crime\",{{Sfn | Cash | Carr | 1997 | pp = 85\u20136}} and on behalf of those who have been betrayed by age or drugs.{{Sfn | Cash | Carr | 1997 | pp = 85\u20136}} \"And,\" Cash added, \"with the [[Vietnam War]] as painful in my mind as it was in most other Americans', I wore it 'in mournin' for the lives that could have been.'...

He made commercials for Amoco, an unpopular enterprise in an era in which oil companies made high profits while consumers suffered through high gasoline prices and shortages. However, his autobiography (the first of two), titled ''Man in Black'', was published in 1975 and sold 1.3&nbsp;million copies. A second, ''Cash: The Autobiography'', appeared in 1997. His friendship with [[Billy Graham]] led to the production of a film about the life of Jesus, ''[[The Gospel Road]]'', which Cash co-wrote and narrated.\n\nHe also continued to appear on television, hosting an annual Christmas special on [[CBS]] throughout the 1970s. Later television appearances included a starring role in an episode of ''[[List of Columbo episodes#Season 3|Columbo: Swan Song]]''  He also appeared with his wife on an episode of ''[[Little House on the Prairie (TV series)|Little House on the Prairie]]'' entitled \"The Collection\" and gave a performance as [[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]] in the 1985 [[American Civil War]] television mini-series ''[[North and South (TV miniseries)|North and South]]''. Johnny and June also appeared in [[Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman]] as a recurring couple.\n\nHe was friendly with every US President starting with [[Richard Nixon]]. He was closest to [[Jimmy Carter]], with whom he became close friends.{{Sfn | Cash | Carr | 1997}}{{Rp | needed = yes|date=December 2012}} He stated that he found all of them personally charming, noting that this was probably essential to getting oneself elected.{{Sfn | Cash | Carr | 1997}}{{Rp | needed = yes|date=December 2012}}\n\nWhen invited to perform at the [[White House]] for the first time in 1970,<ref>{{Citation | url = http://blog.nixonfoundation.org/2011/04/rn-welcomes-the-man-in-black-to-the-white-house | title = 17 April 1970: RN Welcomes \u2018The Man In Black\u2019 to the White House | publisher = Nixon Foundation | type = blog | date = April 17, 2011}}</ref> Richard Nixon's office requested that he play \"[[Okie from Muskogee (song)|Okie from Muskogee]]\" (a satirical [[Merle Haggard]] song about people who despised youthful drug users and war protesters) and \"Welfare Cadillac\" (a Guy Drake song which denies the integrity of welfare recipients). Cash declined to play either and instead selected other songs, including \"The Ballad of [[Ira Hayes]]\" (about a brave [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] [[World War II]] veteran who was mistreated upon his return to [[Arizona]]), and his own compositions, \"[[What Is Truth (song)|What Is Truth]]\" and \"Man in Black\". Cash wrote that the reasons for denying Nixon's song choices were not knowing them and having fairly short notice to rehearse them, rather than any political reason.{{Sfn | Cash | Carr | 1997}}{{Rp | needed = yes|date=December 2012}} However, Cash added, even if Nixon's office had given Cash enough time to learn and rehearse the songs, their choice of pieces that conveyed \"[[Hippie|antihippie]] and [[Black people|antiblack]]\" sentiments might have backfired.{{Sfn | Cash | Carr | 2003 | p = 212}}\n\n=== Highwaymen ===\n[[File:Highwaymen.jpg|thumb|200px|[[The Highwaymen (country supergroup)|The Highwaymen]] members [[Kris Kristofferson]], Johnny Cash, [[Waylon Jennings]], [[Willie Nelson]]]]\nIn 1980, Cash became the [[Country Music Hall of Fame| Country Music Hall of Fame's]] youngest living inductee at age 48, but during the 1980s his records failed to make a major impact on the country charts, although he continued to tour successfully. In the mid-1980s, he recorded and toured with [[Waylon Jennings]], [[Willie Nelson]], and [[Kris Kristofferson]] as [[The Highwaymen (country supergroup)|The Highwaymen]], making three hit albums which were released beginning with the originally titled \"Highwaymen\" in 1985, followed by \"Highwaymen 2\" in 1990, and concluding with \"Highwaymen&nbsp;\u2013 The Road Goes on forever\" in 1995. Of the group's four members, Cash was the only one not a Texan.\n\nDuring that period, Cash appeared in a number of television films. In 1981, he starred in ''[[The Pride of Jesse Hallam]]'', winning fine reviews for a film that called attention to adult [[illiteracy]]. In the same year, Cash appeared as a \"very special guest star\" in an episode of the ''[[Muppet Show]]''. In 1983, he appeared as a heroic sheriff in ''[[Murder in Coweta County]]'', based on a real-life Georgia murder case, which co-starred [[Andy Griffith]] as his nemesis. Cash had tried for years to make the film, for which he won acclaim.\n\nCash relapsed into addiction after being administered painkillers for a serious abdominal injury in 1983 caused by an unusual incident in which he was kicked and wounded by an ostrich he kept on his farm.<ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.exclaim.ca/index.asp?layid=22&csid=1&csid1=439 | title = Johnny Cash: The Rebel | publisher = Exclaim | place = [[Canada|CA]] | page = 3}}</ref>\n\nAt a hospital visit in 1988, this time to watch over Waylon Jennings (who was recovering from a heart attack), Jennings suggested that Cash have himself checked into the hospital for his own heart condition. Doctors recommended preventive heart surgery, and Cash underwent [[coronary artery bypass surgery|double bypass surgery]] in the same hospital. Both recovered, although Cash refused to use any prescription painkillers, fearing a relapse into dependency. Cash later claimed that during his operation, he had what is called a \"[[near death experience]]\".\n\nCash's recording career and his general relationship with the Nashville establishment were at an all-time low in the 1980s. He realized that his record label of nearly 30 years, Columbia, was growing indifferent to him and was not properly marketing him (he was \"invisible\" during that time, as he said in his autobiography). Cash recorded an intentionally awful song to protest, a self-parody.{{citation needed|date=October 2010}} \"Chicken in Black\" was about Cash's brain being transplanted into a chicken. Ironically, the song turned out to be a larger commercial success than any of his other recent material. Between 1981 and 1984, he recorded several sessions with famed [[countrypolitan]] producer [[Billy Sherrill]] which were shelved; they would be released by Columbia's sister label [[Legacy Recordings]] in 2014 as ''[[Out Among the Stars]]''.<ref name=\"ats\">{{Cite news |url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/music/posts/la-et-ms-johnny-cash-lost-album-out-among-the-stars-20131210,0,2223681.story |title='Lost' Early-'80s Johnny Cash Album Slated for March 25 Release |last=Lewis |first=Randy |date=December 10, 2013 |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |publisher=[[Tribune Company]]}}</ref> Nevertheless, he was hoping to kill the relationship with the label before they did, and it was not long after \"Chicken in Black\" that Columbia and Cash parted ways.\n\nIn 1986, Cash returned to Sun Studios in Memphis to team up with [[Roy Orbison]], [[Jerry Lee Lewis]], and [[Carl Perkins]] to create the album ''[[Class of '55]]''. Also in 1986, Cash published his only novel, ''Man in White'', a book about [[Paul of Tarsus|Saul]] and his conversion to become the Apostle Paul. In 1988, Cash campaigned for Senator [[Al Gore]], who was seeking the Democratic Party nomination in [[United States presidential election, 1988|that year's presidential election]].  He also recorded ''Johnny Cash Reads The Complete [[New Testament]]'' in 1990.\n\n=== American Recordings ===\n[[File:Johnny Cash sings a duet with a Navy lieutenant.jpg|thumb|Johnny Cash sings a duet with a Navy lieutenant c. 1987]]\nAfter [[Columbia Records]] dropped Cash from his recording contract, he had a short and unsuccessful stint with [[Mercury Records]] from 1987 to 1991 (see [[Johnny Cash discography#Mercury Records|Johnny Cash discography]]).\n\nHis career was rejuvenated in the 1990s, leading to popularity with an audience not traditionally interested in country music. In 1991, he sang a version of \"Man in Black\" for the [[Christian punk]] band [[One Bad Pig]]'s album ''I Scream Sunday''. In 1993, he sang \"[[The Wanderer (U2 song)|The Wanderer]]\" on [[U2]]'s album ''[[Zooropa]]''. Although no longer sought after by major labels, he was offered a contract with producer [[Rick Rubin]]'s [[American Recordings (US)|American Recordings]] label, better known for [[rap music|rap]] and [[hard rock]].\n\nUnder Rubin's supervision, he recorded ''[[American Recordings (album)|American Recordings]]'' (1994) in his living room, accompanied only by his Martin Dreadnought guitar&nbsp;\u2013 one of many Cash played throughout his career.<ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.fretbase.com/fretbase/2008/08/the-guitars-of.html | publisher = Fretbase | title = The Guitars of Johnny Cash |date=Aug 2008}}</ref> The album featured covers of contemporary artists selected by Rubin and had much critical and commercial success, winning a Grammy for [[Best Contemporary Folk Album]]. Cash wrote that his reception at the 1994 [[Glastonbury Festival]] was one of the highlights of his career. This was the beginning of a decade of music industry accolades and commercial success. Cash teamed up with [[Brooks & Dunn]] to contribute \"[[Folsom Prison Blues]]\" to the AIDS benefit album ''[[Red Hot + Country]]'' produced by the [[Red Hot Organization]]. On the same album, he performed the [[Bob Dylan]] favorite \"[[Forever Young (Bob Dylan song)|Forever Young]]\".\n\nCash and his wife appeared on a number of episodes of the television series ''[[Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman]]'' starring [[Jane Seymour (actress)|Jane Seymour]]. The actress thought so highly of Cash that she later named one of her twin sons after him. He lent his voice for a [[cameo role]] in ''[[The Simpsons]]'' episode \"[[El Viaje Misterioso de Nuestro Jomer (The Mysterious Voyage of Homer)]],\" as the \"Space Coyote\" that guides [[Homer Simpson]] on a spiritual quest. In 1996, Cash enlisted the accompaniment of [[Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers]] and released ''[[Unchained (Johnny Cash album)|Unchained]]'', which won the [[Best Country Album]] Grammy. Believing he did not explain enough of himself in his 1975 autobiography ''Man in Black'', he wrote ''Cash: The Autobiography'' in 1997.\n\n== Last years ==\n[[File:Cashcartergrab.jpg|thumb|right|Cash's original grave (top) and the Cash/Carter memorial]]\nIn 1997, Cash was diagnosed with the [[neurodegenerative]] disease [[Shy-Drager syndrome]], a form of [[multiple system atrophy]]. The diagnosis was later altered to [[Dysautonomia|autonomic neuropathy]] associated with [[diabetes]]. This illness forced Cash to curtail his touring. He was hospitalized in 1998 with severe [[pneumonia]], which damaged his lungs. The albums ''[[American III: Solitary Man]]'' (2000) and ''[[American IV: The Man Comes Around]]'' (2002) contained Cash's response to his illness in the form of songs of a slightly more somber tone than the first two American albums. The video that was released for \"[[Hurt (Nine Inch Nails song)|Hurt]]\", a cover of the song by [[Nine Inch Nails]], fits Cash's view of his past and feelings of regret. The video for the song, from ''American IV'', is now generally recognized as \"his [[epitaph]],\"<ref>{{Citation | publisher = Rolling Stone Magazine | title = The Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock & Roll | year = 2004}}</ref>{{Rp | needed = yes | date =December 2012}} and received particular critical and popular acclaim.\n\n[[June Carter Cash]] died on May 15,<!-- NOTE: Following is JUNE's death date and age, which is *similar* to Johnny's.

A [[box set]] titled ''[[Unearthed (Johnny Cash album)|Unearthed]]'' was issued posthumously. It included four CDs of unreleased material recorded with Rubin as well as a ''Best of Cash on American'' retrospective CD.\n\nIn recognition of his lifelong support of [[SOS Children's Villages]], his family invited friends and fans to donate to the Johnny Cash Memorial Fund in his memory.

Cash was a musician who was not tied to a single genre. He recorded songs that could be considered [[rock and roll]], [[blues]], [[rockabilly]], [[folk music|folk]], and [[gospel music|gospel]], and exerted an influence on each of those genres. Moreover, he had the unique distinction among country artists of having \"crossed over\" late in his career to become popular with an unexpected audience, young [[indie rock|indie]] and [[alternative rock]] fans. His diversity was evidenced by his presence in three major music halls of fame: the [[Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame]] (1977), the [[Country Music Hall of Fame]] (1980), and the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] (1992). Only thirteen performers are in both of the last two, and only [[Hank Williams Sr.]], [[Jimmie Rodgers (country singer)|Jimmie Rodgers]], [[Bob Wills]], and [[Bill Monroe]] share the honor with Cash of being in all three. However, only Cash was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in the regular manner, unlike the other country members, who were inducted as \"early influences.\" His pioneering contribution to the genre has also been recognized by the [[Rockabilly Hall of Fame]].<ref>{{cite web | title= RHOF Inductees with Certificates |publisher= Rockabilly Hall of Fame |url=http://www.rockabillyhall.com/Certificates.html |accessdate=December 31, 2007}}</ref> He received the [[Kennedy Center Honors]] in 1996.
