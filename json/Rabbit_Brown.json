His music was characterized by a mixture of [[blues]], pop songs, and original topical [[ballads]]. On May 11, 1927, he recorded six singles for [[Victor Talking Machine Company|Victor Records]]. \"James Alley Blues\" is included in the ''[[Anthology of American Folk Music]]'' and has been covered by [[Bob Dylan]] and others.\n\n==Biography==\nRabbit Brown was most likely born around 1880 in or near [[New Orleans, Louisiana]]. He did live in New Orleans from his youth on, and eventually moved to a rough district called the Battlefield. Here, several events inspired some of his future songs.<ref name=\"AMG\"/>\n\nRabbit Brown mainly performed at [[nightclub]]s and on the street. A couple of his most popular songs were his topical [[ballads]], \"The Downfall of the Lion\" and \"Gyp the Blood\", which were based on actual events that occurred in New Orleans.<ref name=\"AMG\"/> \n\nBrown died in 1937, probably in New Orleans.<ref name=\"AMG\"/>\n\nFive of his recordings appear on the [[compilation album]] ''The Greatest Songsters: Complete Works (1927-1929)''.<ref name=\"AMG\"/> \n\nIn 2003 an anthology collection of rural acoustic gospel music titled ''Goodbye, Babylon'' was released, bringing to renewed public attention one of the two known recordings made by an otherwise undocumented singer named Blind Willie Harris. This piece, \"Where He Leads Me I Will Follow,\" was recorded in New Orleans in 1929, and in describing it, the authors of the [[Compact disc|CD]] liner notes pointed out its \"strikingly similar\" resemblance to the 1927 New Orleans recordings of Richard Rabbit Brown. Since then, more discussion has ensued among early blues and gospel collectors and scholars, leading some to state without equivocation that Harris was a [[pseudonym]] of Brown's. Each listener will have to decide for him or herself the truth of the claim, as no documentation has been found to link Harris with Brown.\n\n==Quotation==\n{{cquote|I done seen better days, but I'm putting up with these.}}\n''Rabbit Brown''<ref name=\"russell\">{{cite book\n| first= Tony\n| last= Russell\n| year= 1997\n| title= The Blues: From Robert Johnson to Robert Cray\n| edition= \n| publisher= Carlton Books Limited \n| location= Dubai\n| page = 9\n| isbn= 1-85868-255-X}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of blues musicians]]\n*[[Music of Louisiana]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.bluesworld.com/RabbitBrown.html \"Times Ain't Like They Used to Be: Rabbit Brown, New Orleans Songster\"  by Kevin S.
