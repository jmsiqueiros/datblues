In addition to composing the songs for  ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'', including the classic 1938 song, \"[[Over the Rainbow]],\u201d Arlen is a highly regarded contributor to the [[Great American Songbook]]. \"Over the Rainbow\" was voted the twentieth century's No. 1 song by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) and the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.haroldarlen.com/honors.html |title=\"New Song List Puts 'Rainbow' Way Up High.\" CNN.com/Entertainment |publisher=Haroldarlen.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-07}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://archives.cnn.com/2001/SHOWBIZ/Music/03/07/365.songs/index.html |title=New song list puts 'Rainbow' way up high - CNN |publisher=Archives.cnn.com |date=2001-03-07 |accessdate=2012-06-07}}</ref>\n\n==Life and career==\nArlen was born '''Hyman Arluck''', in [[Buffalo, New York]], United States, the child of a Jewish [[hazzan|cantor]]. His twin brother died the next day. He learned the [[piano]] as a youth and formed a band as a young man. He achieved some local success as a pianist and singer and moved to [[New York City]] in his early 20s. He worked as an accompanist in vaudeville.<ref>Laurie, Joe, Jr. ''Vaudeville: From the Honky-tonks to the Palace.'' New York: Henry Holt, 1953. p. 328.</ref> At this point, he changed his name to Harold Arlen.  Between 1926 and about 1934, Arlen appeared occasionally as a band vocalist on records by [[The Buffalodians]], [[Red Nichols]], [[Joe Venuti]], [[Leo Reisman]] and [[Eddie Duchin]], usually singing his own compositions.\n\nIn 1929, Arlen composed his first well-known song: \"[[Get Happy (song)|Get Happy]]\" (with lyrics by [[Ted Koehler]]). Throughout the early and mid-1930s, Arlen and Koehler wrote shows for the [[Cotton Club (New York City)|Cotton Club]], a popular [[Harlem, Manhattan|Harlem]] night club, as well as for [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] [[musical theater|musicals]] and [[Hollywood, California|Hollywood]] [[musical film|films]]. Arlen and Koehler's partnership resulted in a number of hit songs, including the familiar standards \"[[Let's Fall in Love]]\" and \"[[Stormy Weather (song)|Stormy Weather]].\"  Arlen continued to perform as a pianist and vocalist with some success, most notably on records with [[Leo Reisman|Leo Reisman's]] society dance orchestra.\n\nArlen's compositions have always been popular with [[jazz]] musicians because of his facility at incorporating a [[blues]] feeling into the idiom of the conventional American popular song.\n\nIn the mid-1930s, Arlen married, and spent increasing time in California, writing for movie musicals. It was at this time that he began working with lyricist [[E.Y. \"Yip\" Harburg]]. In 1938, the team was hired by [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] to compose songs for ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]''. The most famous of these is the song \"[[Over the Rainbow]]\" for which they won the [[Academy Award for Best Song|Academy Award for Best Music, Original Song]]. They also wrote \"[[Down with Love (song)|Down with Love]]\" (featured in the 1937 Broadway show, [[Hooray for What!]]), a song later featured in the 2003 movie ''[[Down with Love]]''.\n\nArlen was a longtime friend and former roommate of actor [[Ray Bolger]] who would star in ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'', the film for which \"Over the Rainbow\" was written.\n\nIn the 1940s, he teamed up with lyricist [[Johnny Mercer]], and continued to write hit songs like \"[[Blues in the Night]]\", \"[[Out of This World (Johnny Mercer song)|Out of this World]]\", \"[[That Old Black Magic]],\" \"[[Ac-Cent-Tchu-Ate the Positive]],\" \"[[Any Place I Hang My Hat Is Home]]\", \"[[Come Rain or Come Shine]]\"\" and \"[[One for My Baby (and One More for the Road)]]\" .\n\nArlen composed two defining tunes which bookend [[Judy Garland]]'s musical persona: as a yearning, innocent girl in \"Over the Rainbow\" and a world-weary, \"chic chanteuse\" with \"[[The Man that Got Away]]\", the latter written for the 1954 version of the movie ''[[A Star Is Born (1954 film)|A Star Is Born]]''.\n\n==Timeline==\n{{prose|date=July 2013}}\n\n[[File:Peggy Lee Harold Arlen Vic Damone 1961.JPG|thumb|200px|Arlen performs with [[Peggy Lee]] and [[Vic Damone]] in 1961.]]\n\n*1905 Arlen born in [[Buffalo, New York]]\n*1920 (age 15) He formed his first professional band, Hyman Arluck's Snappy Trio.\n*1921 (16) Against his parent's wishes he left home.\n*1923 (18) With his new band - The Southbound Shufflers, performed on the Crystal Beach lake boat \"Canadiana\" during the summer of 1923.\n*1924 (19) Performed at Lake Shore Manor during the summer of 1924.\n*1924 (19) Wrote his first song, collaborating with friend Hyman Cheiffetz to write \"My Gal, My Pal\".
