Milburn participated with the Houston [[jazz]] and [[blues]] musicians. He was a polished pianist and performer and during 1946 attracted the attention of a woman who arranged a [[sound recording and reproduction|recording]] session with [[Aladdin Records (US)|Aladdin Records]] in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]]. Milburn's relationship with Aladdin lasted eight years during which he produced more than 75 [[song|sides]]. His cover version of \"[[Down the Road a Piece]]\" (1946) was a [[blues]] song with a [[Texas]] [[boogie]] beat that was similar in many respects to [[rock music]].<ref name=\"roll\">{{cite book\n| first=& James Henke (eds) \n| last= Anthony DeCurtis\n| year=1980 \n| title= The RollingStone: The Definitive History of the Most Important Artists and Their Music\n| edition=(3rd Ed.) \n| publisher=Random House, Inc. \n| location=New York, N.Y.\n| pages= 9\n| isbn= 0-679-73728-6}}</ref> However, none became popular until 1949 when seven of his [[Single (music)|singles]] got the attention of the [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]] audience.  \"Hold Me Baby\" and \"[[Chicken Shack Boogie]]\" landed numbers eight and nine on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'''s survey of 1949's R&B [[Bestseller (music)|Bestseller]]s.<ref name=\"shaw\">{{cite book\n| first= Arnold\n| last= Shaw\n| year= 1978\n| title= Honkers and Shouters\n| edition= \n| publisher=Macmillan Publishing Company \n| location= New York\n| pages= 99\u2013101\n| isbn= 0-02-061740-2}}</ref>\nHe became one of the main performers  associated with the [[Central Avenue, Los Angeles, California|Central Avenue]] music scene in Los Angeles.

For the next few years each of his tours was composed of a series of one-nighters. After three years of solo performing he returned to Houston during 1956 to reform his band. During 1957 Milburn's releases with Aladdin Records did not sell well, and the [[record label]], having its own problems, terminated.
