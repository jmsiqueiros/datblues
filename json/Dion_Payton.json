Wright]].  He first caught the attention of [[Alligator Records]] while playing [[rhythm guitar]] and co-arranging [[Lonnie Brooks]]' 1983 [[album]], ''Hot Shot''.  After leaving Brooks, Payton assembled the 43rd Street Blues Band in 1985, which served as the weekend house band at Kingston Mines for many years.  The band's name referred to the location of the Checkerboard Lounge where they served as [[Junior Wells]]'s backing band.  Accompanying Payton on rhythm guitar was [[Joanna Connor]].   Payton was signed to a [[recording contract]] with [[Virgin Records]], but never released any albums with Virgin or other [[record label]].  His only commercial recording is his \"All Your Affection Is Gone,\" from The New Bluebloods recording released in 1987.\n\nPayton now performs infrequently in the Chicago area.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.alligator.com/index.cfm?section=artists&artistID=139&currTrackNum=1&playPosition=0&vol=70&pan=0&playState=play Alligator Records]\n*[http://www.blindpigrecords.com/index.cfm?section=artists&artistid=21 Blind Pig Records]\n*[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S_6AJUgFPc Rare \"Cadillac Assembly Line\"] video 1988 Chicago Blues Festival <!-- this is an important link because video material of this artist is pretty much non-existent on line -->\n{{Persondata <!-- Metadata: see [[Wikipedia:Persondata]]. -->\n| NAME              = Payton, Dion\n| ALTERNATIVE NAMES =\n| SHORT DESCRIPTION = [[United States|American]] [[Chicago blues]] guitarist and singer\n| DATE OF BIRTH     = October 21, 1950\n| PLACE OF BIRTH    = [[Greenwood, Mississippi]], [[United Statones]]\n| DATE OF DEATH     =\n| PLACE OF DEATH    =\n}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Payton, Dion}}\n[[Category:1950 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:Chicago blues musicians]]\n[[Category:American blues musicians]]"}]}}}}
