Inspired by recordings of [[Blind Boy Fuller]] and [[Blind Lemon Jefferson]], he played locally and found employment in a sawmill. In 1937, he relocated to [[New Jersey]], working as a chauffeur and later in an hotel in [[Columbus, Ohio]].<ref name=\"AMG\">{{cite web |url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p33882/biography|pure_url=yes}}|title=Archie Edwards |author=Linda Seida |publisher=[[Allmusic]] |accessdate=September 15, 2011}}</ref><ref name=\"AEBHF\"/> Edwards served time in the [[military police]] during [[World War II]], but struggled to settle in the post-war years.  He eventually found work as a barber, opening his own shop in [[Washington, D.C.]] in 1959. It was frequented by [[Mississippi John Hurt]], and the duo formed a loose working relationship with [[Skip James]], which endured several years before his friend Hurt's death in 1966. After mourning Edwards wrote the song, \"The Road is Rough and Rocky\".<ref name=\"AMG\"/><ref name=\"AEBHF\">{{cite web |url=http://www.acousticblues.com/Archie/archie.html |title=Archie Edwards Blues Heritage Foundation |author=Richard Burton |date= |work= |publisher=Acousticblues.com |accessdate=September 15, 2011}}</ref>\n\nEdwards found more regular work at [[music festival]]s and in local [[nightclub|clubs]], and also joined [[John Jackson (blues musician)|John Jackson]], [[Cephas & Wiggins|John Cephas and Phil Wiggins]], Flora Molton and Mother Scott, and played around Washington billed as the Travelling Blues Workshop.<ref name=\"AMG\"/><ref name=\"AEBHF\"/><ref name=\"Herzhaft\">{{cite book\n| first= G\u00e9rard\n| last= Herzhaft\n| year= 1997\n| title= Encyclopedia of the Blues\n| edition= 2nd\n| publisher= The University of Arkansas Press \n| location= Fayetteville\n| isbn= 1-55728-452-0\n| page= 34}}</ref> \n\nIn 1978, Edwards appeared with the [[American Folk Blues Festival]] playing across Europe.
