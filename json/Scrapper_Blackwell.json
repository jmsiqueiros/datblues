Part [[Cherokee]], he grew up and spent most of his life in [[Indianapolis, Indiana|Indianapolis]], [[Indiana]].  Blackwell was given the [[nickname]], \"Scrapper\", by his grandmother, due to his fiery nature.<ref>{{Cite book |first=Stefan |last=Grossman |year=2007 |title= Stefan Grossman's Early Masters of American Blues Guitar: Country Blues |publisher=Alfred Music Publishing |page=6 |isbn=978-0-7390-4281-6 }}</ref> His father played the [[fiddle]], but Blackwell was a self-taught guitarist, building his first guitar out of [[Cigar box guitar|cigar boxes]], wood and wire.  He also learned the piano, occasionally playing professionally.  By his teens, Blackwell was a part-time musician, traveling as far as [[Chicago]].  Known for being withdrawn and hard to work with, Blackwell established a rapport with pianist [[Leroy Carr]], whom he met in Indianapolis in the mid-1920s, creating a productive working relationship.  Carr convinced Blackwell to [[sound recording and reproduction|record]] with him for the [[Vocalion Records|Vocalion]] label in 1928;<ref name=\"russell\">{{cite book |first=Tony |last=Russell |year=1997 |title=The Blues: From Robert Johnson to Robert Cray |publisher=Carlton Books Limited |location= Dubai |pages=52\u201353 |isbn= 1-85868-255-X}}</ref> the result was \"[[How Long, How Long Blues]]\", the biggest blues [[hit record|hit]] of that year.\n\nBlackwell also made [[solo (music)|solo]] recordings for Vocalion, including \"Kokomo Blues\" which was transformed into \"Old Kokomo Blues\" by [[Kokomo Arnold]] before being redone as \"[[Sweet Home Chicago]]\" by [[Robert Johnson (musician)|Robert Johnson]].  Blackwell and Carr toured throughout the [[Midwestern United States|American Midwest]] and South between 1928 and 1935 as stars of the blues scene, recording over 100 sides. \"Prison Bound Blues\" (1928), \"Mean Mistreater Mama\" (1934), and \"Blues Before Sunrise\" (1934) were popular tracks.<ref name=\"russell\"/>\n\nBlackwell made several solo excursions; a 1931 visit to [[Richmond, Indiana]] to record at [[Gennett Records|Gennett]] [[recording studio|studios]] is notable.  Blackwell, dissatisfied with the lack of credit given his contributions with Carr, was remedied by Vocalion's [[Mayo Williams]] after his 1931 breakaway.  In all future recordings, Blackwell received equal credit with Carr in terms of [[recording contract]]s and songwriting credits.  Blackwell's last recording session with Carr was in February 1935 for the [[Bluebird Records|Bluebird]] [[record label|label]].  The recording session ended bitterly, as both musicians left the studio mid-session and on bad terms, stemming from payment disputes.  Two months later Blackwell received a phone call informing him of Carr's death due to heavy drinking and [[nephritis]].  Blackwell soon recorded a tribute to his musical partner of seven years (\"My Old Pal Blues\") before retiring from the [[music industry]].\n\nBlackwell returned to music in the late 1950s and was first recorded in June 1958 by Colin C. Pomroy (those recordings were released as late as 1967 on the Collector label). Soon afterwards he was recorded by Duncan P. Schiedt for [[Doug Dobell]]'s [[77 Records]]. \n\nScrapper Blackwell was then recorded in 1961, in Indianapolis, by a young Art Rosenbaum for the [[Prestige Records|Prestige]]/[[Bluesville Records]] label. The story is recounted by Rosenbaum as starting three years before the recordings were made. While still growing up in his hometown of Indianapolis, an African American woman that Rosenbaum knew said he \"had to meet a man that she knew, who played guitar, played blues and christian songs, they'll make the hairs stand up on the back of your neck.\" Rosenbaum goes into more details of meeting Blackwell; \"I met the gentleman across the street from the Methodist hospital in Indianapolis\". Scrapper's friend said, \"well he hasn't got a guitar\", so Art said \"well I got a guitar.\" Scrapper than said that he needed some 'bird food', with Rosenbaum being confused as to what he was referring to, Scrapper continued, \"you gotta get some bird food for the bird, before the bird sings... beer!\" Rosenbaum said, \"I'm too young!\" Scrapper and his friend continued, \"we'll buy the beer, you just give us some money.\" Art concludes the meeting, \"So we did, and he started playing these beautiful blues. I didn't realize he was Scrapper Blackwell til I mentioned his name to a blues collecting friend.\" To which then the friend exclaimed, \"you met Scrapper Blackwell!?\"\n\nHe was ready to resume his blues career when he was shot and killed during a mugging in an Indianapolis alley. He was 59 years old.  Although the crime remains unsolved, police arrested his neighbour at the time for the murder.  Blackwell is buried in New Crown Cemetery, Indianapolis.\n\n==Key recording==\n*''The Virtuoso Guitar of Scrapper Blackwell'' ([[Yazoo Records]]) - accompaniments and duets with Carr intersperse lean solo blues by the sharpest guitarist of his day.<ref name=\"russell\"/>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n* Swinton, Paul.
