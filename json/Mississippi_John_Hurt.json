He first recorded for [[Okeh Records]] in 1928, but these were commercial failures. Hurt then drifted out of the [[Recording industry|recording scene]], and he continued his work as a [[Farming|farmer]]. Tom Hoskins, a blues enthusiast, would be the first to locate Hurt in 1963. He convinced Hurt to relocate to [[Washington, D.C.]], where he was recorded by the [[Library of Congress]] in 1964. This rediscovery helped further the [[American folk music revival]], which had led to the rediscovery of many other [[List of blues musicians|bluesmen]] of Hurt's era. Hurt entered the same [[university]] and [[coffeehouse]] [[Concert tour|concert circuit]] as his contemporaries, as well as other [[List of Delta blues musicians|Delta blues musicians]] brought out of retirement. As well as playing concerts, he recorded several [[studio album]]s for [[Vanguard Records]].\n\nHe died in [[Grenada, Mississippi]].

He was completely self-taught, stealthily playing the guitar of a friend of his mother's, who often stayed at the Hurt home while courting a lady who lived near by. His style was not reminiscent of any other style being played at the time; it was the way Hurt \"thought the guitar ''should'' sound\". He spent much of his youth playing [[old time music]] for friends and dances, earning a living as a farmhand into the 1920s.<ref name=\"AMG\">{{cite web |first= |last= |url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p379/biography|pure_url=yes}} |title=Biography by Bruce Eder |publisher=Allmusic.com |accessdate=May 30, 2009}}</ref> His fast, highly [[syncopation|syncopated]] style of playing made his music adept for dancing.

After auditioning \"Monday Morning Blues\" at his home, he took part in two recording sessions, in [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]] and [[New York City]] (see Discography below).<ref name=\"AMG\"/> While in Memphis, Hurt recalled seeing \"many, many blues singers ... [[Lonnie Johnson (musician)|Lonnie Johnson]], [[Blind Lemon Jefferson]], [[Bessie Smith]], and lots, lots more.\"<ref name=linear/> Hurt described his first recording session as such:\n{{bquote|... a great big hall with only the three of us in it: me, the man [Rockwell], and the engineer. It was really something. I sat on a chair, and they pushed the microphone right up to my mouth and told me that I couldn't move after they had found the right position. I had to keep my head absolutely still. Oh, I was nervous, and my neck was sore for days after.<ref name=linear/>}}\n\nHurt attempted further negotiations with Okeh to record again, but after the commercial failure of the resulting records, and Okeh Records going out of business during the [[Great Depression]], Hurt returned to Avalon and obscurity, working as a [[sharecropper]] and playing local parties and dances.<ref name=\"russell\"/>\n\n=== Rediscovery ===\n[[File:Mississippi John Hurt - grave.jpg|thumb|right|Grave of Mississippi John Hurt]]\nAfter Hurt's renditions of \"[[Frankie and Johnny (song)|Frankie]]\" and \"[[John Henry (song)|Spike Driver Blues]]\" were included in ''[[Anthology of American Folk Music|The Anthology of American Folk Music]]'' in 1952, and an [[Australia]]n man discovered a copy of \"Avalon Blues\", there became increased interest in finding Hurt himself.<ref name=dahl>Dahl, Bill.

His performance at the 1963 [[Newport Folk Festival]] saw his star rise amongst the new [[folk revival]]  audience.<ref name=\"russell\"/>  Before his death he played extensively in [[college]]s, [[concert hall]]s, [[coffee house]]s and also on ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]'', as well as recording three further albums for [[Vanguard Records]].<ref name=\"russell\"/> Much of his repertoire was recorded for the [[Library of Congress]], also. His fans particularly liked the [[ragtime]] songs \"[[Salty Dog Blues|Salty Dog]]\" and \"Candy Man\", and the blues [[ballad]]s \"Spike Driver Blues\" (a variant of \"John Henry\") and \"Frankie\".<ref name=\"russell\"/>\n\nHurt's influence spanned several music genres including blues, spirituals, [[country music|country]], [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]], folk and contemporary [[rock music|rock and roll]]. A soft-spoken man, his nature was reflected in the work, which consisted of a mellow mix of country, blues and old time music.<ref name=\"AMG\"/>\n\nHurt died on November 2, 1966, of a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] in [[Grenada, Mississippi]].<ref>[http://thedeadrockstarsclub.com/1960.html Thedeadrcokstarsclub.com - accessed May 2009]</ref>\n\n==Style==\nHurt incorporated a fast, [[Plectrum|pick]]-less, syncopated fingerpicking style that he taught himself. He was influenced by very few people; but did recall an elderly, unrecorded, blues singer from that area, Rufus Hanks, who played [[twelve-string guitar]] and [[harmonica]].<ref name=linear/> He also recalled listening to the [[country music|country]] singer [[Jimmie Rodgers (country singer)|Jimmie Rodgers]]. On occasion, Hurt would use an open tuning and a [[Slide guitar|slide]], as he did in his arrangement of \"[[The Ballad of Casey Jones]]\".<ref name=linear/><ref name=dahl/> According to music critic [[Robert Christgau]], \"the school of [[John Fahey (musician)|John Fahey]] proceeded from his finger-picking, and while he's not the only quietly conversational singer in the modern folk tradition, no one else has talked the blues with such delicacy or restraint.\"<ref>{{cite news|last=Christgau|first=Robert|authorlink=Robert Christgau|date=March 11, 1997|url=http://www.robertchristgau.com/xg/cg/cgv297-97.php|title=Consumer Guide|newspaper=[[The Village Voice]]|location=New York|accessdate=July 21, 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Tributes==\n[[File:50 Mississippi John Hurt Museum, Avalon, MS.jpg|thumb|The Mississippi John Hurt Museum in Avalon, Mississippi]]\n\nThere is now a memorial in Avalon, Mississippi for Mississippi John Hurt.

Fahey's posthumous live album ''[[The Great Santa Barbara Oil Slick]]'' also features a version of the piece, there entitled \"Requiem For Mississippi John Hurt\".\n\nBritish folk/blues artist [[Wizz Jones]] recorded a tribute song called \"Mississippi John\" for his 1977 album ''[[Magical Flight]]''.\n\nDelta blues artist [[Rory Block]] recorded an album called \"Avalon - A Tribute to Mississippi John Hurt\" released in 2013 as part of her \"Mentor Series\".<ref name=\"block\">{{cite web|last=Block|first=Rory|title=Avalon: A Tribute To Mississippi John Hurt|url=http://www.stonyplainrecords.com/Web/artist.asp?id=566#1369|publisher=Stony Plain Records|date=4 June 2013|accessdate=11 December 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Discography==\nNOTE:  Sources for this section are as follows:<ref>{{cite web|title=Mississippi John Hurt Discography|publisher=Wirz.de|url=http://www.wirz.de/music/hurtfrm.htm|accessdate=2010-07-10}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Dixon|first1=Robert M.W.|last2=Goodrich|first2=John M.W.|last3=Rye|first3=Howard W.|pages=418\u2013419|year=1997|title=Blues & Gospel Records 1890\u20131943|edition=4th|publisher=Clarendon Press|isbn=0-19-816239-1}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Mississippi John Hurt Album Discography|publisher=[[Allmusic]]|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p379|pure_url=yes}}|accessdate=2010-07-10}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Mississippi John Hurt Compilation Album Discography|publisher=[[Allmusic]]|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p379|pure_url=yes}}|accessdate=2010-07-10}}</ref>\n\n===78 rpm releases===\n* \"[[Frankie and Johnny (song)|Frankie]]\"/\"Nobody's Dirty Business\" <small>([[Okeh Records]], OKeh 8560)</small> (1928)\n* \"[[Stagger Lee (song)|Stack O' Lee]]\"/\"Candy Man Blues\" <small>(Okeh Records, OKeh 8654)</small> (1928)\n* \"Blessed Be the Name\"/\"Praying on the Old Camp Ground\" <small>(Okeh Records, OKeh 8666)</small> (1928)\n* \"Blue Harvest Blues\"/\"[[John Henry (song)|Spike Driver Blues]]\" <small>(Okeh Records, OKeh 8692)</small> (1928)\n* \"Louis Collins\"/\"Got the Blues (Can't Be Satisfied)\" <small>(Okeh Records, OKeh 8724)</small> (1928)\n* \"[[Make Me a Pallet on the Floor|Ain't No Tellin']]\"/\"Avalon Blues\" <small>(Okeh Records, OKeh 8759)</small> (1928)\n\n===Albums===\n* ''Folk Songs and Blues'' [live recordings] <small>([[Piedmont Records]], PLP 13757)</small> (1963)\n* ''Worried Blues'' <small>(Piedmont Records, PLP 13161)</small> (1964)\n* ''[[Today!
