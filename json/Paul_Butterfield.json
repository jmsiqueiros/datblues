After early training as a classical flautist, Butterfield developed an interest in blues harmonica.  He explored the blues scene in his native Chicago, where he was able to meet [[Muddy Waters]] and other blues greats who provided encouragement and a chance to join in the jam sessions.  Soon, Butterfield began performing with fellow blues enthusiasts [[Nick Gravenites]] and [[Elvin Bishop]].\n\nIn 1963, he formed the Paul Butterfield Blues Band, who recorded several successful albums and were a popular fixture on the late-1960s concert and festival circuit, with performances at [[the Fillmore]]s, [[Monterey Pop Festival]], and [[Woodstock]].  They became known for combining electric Chicago blues with a rock urgency as well as their pioneering [[jazz fusion]] performances and recordings.  After the breakup of the group in 1971, Butterfield continued to tour and record in a variety of settings, including with Paul Butterfield's Better Days, his mentor Muddy Waters, and members of the [[roots-rock]] group [[the Band]].\n\nWhile still recording and performing, but in poor health, Butterfield died in 1987 at age 44.  Music critics have acknowledged his development of an original approach that places him among the best-known [[blues harp]] players. The Paul Butterfield Blues Band was nominated for the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 2012, and again in 2013, and he was inducted into the [[Blues Hall of Fame]].  Both panels noted his harmonica skills as well as his contributions to bringing blues-style music to a younger and broader audience.\n\n==Career==\nPaul Butterfield was born in Chicago and raised in the city's [[Hyde Park, Chicago|Hyde Park]] neighborhood. The son of a lawyer and a painter, he attended the [[University of Chicago Laboratory Schools]], a private school associated with the University of Chicago. Exposed to music at an early age, he studied classical flute with Walfrid Kujala of the [[Chicago Symphony Orchestra]].<ref name=\"Huey\">\n{{cite web\n  | last             = Huey\n  | first            = Steve\n  | title             = Paul Butterfield \u2014 Biography\n  | work          = [[Allmusic]]\n  | publisher  = Rovi Corp.\n  | url               = http://www.allmusic.com/artist/paul-butterfield-mn0000019339/biography\n  | accessdate = July 23, 2013\n}}</ref> Butterfield was also athletic and was offered a track scholarship to [[Brown University]].<ref name=\"Huey\"/>  However, a knee injury and a growing interest in blues music sent him in a different direction.  He developed a love for blues harmonica and a friendship with Nick Gravenites, who shared an interest in authentic blues music.<ref name=\"Wolkin, Keenom 2000, p. 40\">Wolkin, Keenom 2000, p. 40.</ref>  By the late 1950s, they started visiting some of Chicago's blues clubs and met musicians such as Muddy Waters, [[Howlin' Wolf]], [[Little Walter]], and [[Otis Rush]], who encouraged them and occasionally let them sit in on jam sessions.  The pair were soon performing as \"Nick and Paul\" in college-area coffee houses.<ref name=\"Milward p66\">Milward 2013, p. 66.</ref>\n\nIn the early 1960s, Butterfield attended the [[University of Chicago]], where he met aspiring blues guitarist Elvin Bishop.<ref name=\"Field\">Field 2000, pp. 212\u2013214.</ref><ref name=\"Rolling Stone bio\">\n{{cite web\n  | url                 = http://www.rollingstone.com/music/artists/paul-butterfield/biography\n  | title               = Paul Butterfield \u2014 Biography\n  | website        = [[Rolling Stone]]\n  | publisher     = \n  | accessdate   = September 13, 2013\n}}</ref> Both began devoting more time to music than studies and soon became full-time musicians.<ref name=\"Milward p66\"/>   Eventually, Butterfield, who sang and played harmonica, and Bishop, accompanying him on guitar, were offered a regular gig at Big John's, an important folk club in the Old Town district on Chicago's north side.<ref name=\"Erlewine p41\">Erlewine 1996, p. 41.</ref>  With this prospect, they were able to entice bassist [[Jerome Arnold]] and drummer [[Sam Lay]] (both from Howlin' Wolf's touring band) into forming a group in 1963.  Their engagement at the club was highly successful and brought the group to the attention of record producer [[Paul A. Rothchild]].<ref name=\"Leggett\">\n{{cite web\n  | last             = Leggett\n  | first            = Steve\n  | title             = The Paul Butterfield Blues Band \u2014 Biography\n  | work          = [[Allmusic]]\n  | publisher  = Rovi Corp.\n  | url               = http://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-paul-butterfield-blues-band-mn0000016835/biography\n  | accessdate = September 14, 2013\n}}</ref>\n\n===Butterfield Blues Band with Bloomfield===\nDuring their engagement at Big John's, Butterfield met and occasionally sat in with guitarist [[Mike Bloomfield]], who was also playing at the club.<ref name=\"Field\"/>  By chance, producer Rothchild witnessed one of their performances and impressed by the obvious chemistry between the two.  He convinced Butterfield to bring Bloomfield into the band and they were signed to [[Elektra Records]].<ref name=\"Leggett\"/> Their first attempt to record an album in December 1964 did not meet Rothchild's expectations, although  an early version of \"Born in Chicago\", written by Nick Gravenites, was included on the 1965 Elektra sampler ''Folksong '65'' and created interest in the band (additional early recordings were later released on the 1966 Elektra compilation, ''[[What's Shakin']]'' and ''The Original Lost Elektra Sessions'' in 1995).  In order to better capture their sound, Rothchild convinced Elektra president [[Jac Holzman]] to record a live album.<ref name=\"Rothchild\">Rothchild 1995, pp. 1\u20134.</ref>  In the spring of 1965, the Butterfield Blues Band was recorded at New York's [[Cafe Au Go Go]].  These recordings also failed to satisfy Rothchild, but their appearances at the club brought the group to the attention of the East Coast music community.<ref name=\"Field\"/>  Rothchild was able to get Holzman to agree to a third attempt at recording an album.<ref>Rothchild 1995, p. 3.  Rothchild also recalled Holzman's approval came with the warning, \"Rothchild, do ''not'' fuck this up!\".</ref>\n\nDuring the recording sessions, Paul Rothchild had assumed the role of group manager and used his folk contacts to secure the band more and more engagements outside of Chicago.<ref name=\"Ellis\">Ellis 1997</ref>  At the last minute, Butterfield and band were booked to perform at the [[Newport Folk Festival]] in July 1965.<ref name=\"Field\"/>  They were scheduled as the opening act the first night when the gates opened and again the next afternoon in an urban blues workshop at the festival.<ref name=\"Ellis\"/> Despite limited exposure during their first night and a dismissive introduction the following day by folklorist/blues researcher [[Alan Lomax]],<ref name=\"Marcus\">Marcus 2006, pp. 154\u2013155.</ref><ref>[[Albert Grossman]], who had agreed to take over management of the band the night before, was incensed at Lomax's perceived insults and an argument backstage led to an altercation between the two.</ref> the band was able to attract an unusually large audience for a workshop performance.  [[Maria Muldaur]], with her husband [[Geoff Muldaur|Geoff]], who later toured and recorded with Butterfield, recalled the group's performance as stunning \u2014 it was the first time the many of the mostly folk-music fans had experienced a high-powered electric blues combo.<ref name=\"Ellis\"/>  Among those who took notice was festival regular [[Bob Dylan]], who invited the band to back him for his first live electric performance.  With little rehearsal, Dylan performed a short, four-song set the next day with Bloomfield, Arnold, and Lay (along with [[Al Kooper]] and [[Barry Goldberg]]).<ref name=\"Marcus\"/><ref name=\"Rock Hall\"/>  It was not received well by some of the folk music establishment and generated a lot of [[Electric Dylan controversy|controversy]];<ref name=\"Huey\"/>  however, it was a watershed event and brought the band to the attention of a much larger audience.<ref name=\"Ellis\"/>\n\nAfter adding keyboardist [[Mark Naftalin]], the band's debut album was finally successfully recorded in mid-1965.  Simply titled ''[[The Paul Butterfield Blues Band (album)|The Paul Butterfield Blues Band]]'', it was released later in 1965. The opening song, a newer recording of the previously released \"Born in Chicago\", is an upbeat blues-rocker and set the tone for the album, which included a mix of blues standards, such as \"[[Shake Your Moneymaker (song)|Shake Your Moneymaker]]\",  \"[[Blues with a Feeling]]\", and \"[[Look Over Yonders Wall]]\" and band compositions.  The album, described as a \"hard-driving blues album that, in a word, rocked\",<ref name=\"Erlewine p41\"/> reached number 123 in the [[Billboard 200]] album chart in 1966,<ref name=\"Awards\">\n{{cite web\n  | url                 = http://www.allmusic.com/artist/paul-butterfield-mn0000019339/awards\n  | title               = Paul Butterfield \u2014 Awards\n  | website        = [[Allmusic]]\n  | publisher     = Rovi Corp\n  | accessdate   = July 23, 2013\n}}</ref> although its influence was felt beyond its sales figures.<ref name=\"Leggett\"/>\n\nWhen Sam Lay became ill, jazz drummer [[Billy Davenport]] was invited to replace him.<ref name=\"Leggett\"/> In July 1966, the sextet recorded their second album ''[[East-West]]'', which was released a month later.  The album consists of more varied material, with the band's interpretations of blues ([[Robert Johnson]]'s \"[[Walkin' Blues]]\"), rock ([[Michael Nesmith]]'s \"[[Mary, Mary (song)|Mary, Mary]]\"), R&B ([[Allen Toussaint]]'s \"Get Out of My Life, Woman\"), and jazz selections ([[Nat Adderley]]'s \"[[Work Song]]\").  ''East-West'' reached number 65 in the album chart.<ref name=\"Awards\"/>\n\nThe thirteen-minute instrumental title track \"East-West\" incorporates Indian [[raga]] influences and features some of the earliest [[jazz-fusion]]/[[blues-rock]] excursions, with extended solos by Butterfield and guitarists Mike Bloomfield and Elvin Bishop.<ref name=\"Rolling Stone bio\"/>  It has been identified as \"the first of its kind and marks the root from which the [[acid rock]] tradition emerged\".<ref>\n{{cite encyclopedia\n  | last                    = Tamarkin\n  | first                   = Jeff\n  | encyclopedia     = [[All Music Guide to the Blues: The Definitive Guide to the Blues|All Music Guide to the Blues]]\n  | title                   = ''East-West''\n  | year                   = 1996\n  | publisher          = Miller Freeman Books\n  | isbn                   = 0-87930-424-3\n  | page                  = 42\n}}</ref>  Live versions of the song could last nearly an hour and performances at the San Francisco Fillmore Auditorium \"were a huge influence on the city's [[jam band]]s\".<ref name=\"Houghton\">Houghton 2010, p. 195.</ref>  Bishop recalled, \"[[Quicksilver Messenger Service|Quicksilver]], [[Big Brother and the Holding Company|Big Brother]], and the [[Grateful Dead|Dead]] \u2014 those guys were just chopping chords.

Four songs were released in the UK on a 45 rpm [[Extended play|EP]] in January 1967, titled ''John Mayall's Bluesbreakers with Paul Butterfield''.<ref>Presumably because of licensing restrictions, the EP was marked \"For sale in the U.K. only\", although it soon found its way to some specialty record retailers in the U.S.  The songs were later included as bonus tracks on the 2003 expanded 2-CD reissue of ''A Hard Road'' with most of [[Peter Green (musician)|Peter Green]]'s recordings with Mayall.</ref>\n\n===Later Butterfield Blues Band===\nIn spite of their success, the Butterfield Blues Band lineup soon changed; Arnold and Davenport left the band, and Bloomfield went on to form his own group, [[Electric Flag]].<ref name=\"Leggett\"/> With Bishop and Naftalin remaining on guitar and keyboards, they added bassist Bugsy Maugh, drummer [[Phillip Wilson (drummer)|Phillip Wilson]], and saxophonists [[David Sanborn]] and [[Gene Dinwiddie]]. Together, they recorded the band's third album, ''[[The Resurrection of Pigboy Crabshaw]]'', in 1967.  The album cut back on the extended instrumental jams and went in a more [[rhythm and blues]]-influenced horn-driven direction with songs such as [[Charles Brown (musician)|Charles Brown]]'s \"[[Driftin' Blues]]\" (retitled \"Driftin' and Driftin'\"), [[Otis Rush]]'s \"[[Double Trouble (Otis Rush song)|Double Trouble]]\", and [[Junior Parker]]'s \"[[Driving Wheel (song)|Driving Wheel]]\".<ref>\n{{cite encyclopedia\n  | last                    = Erlewine\n  | first                   = Michael\n  | authorlink         = Michael Erlewine\n  | encyclopedia     = [[All Music Guide to the Blues: The Definitive Guide to the Blues|All Music Guide to the Blues]]\n  | title                   = ''The Resurrection of Pigboy Crabshaw''\n  | year                   = 1996\n  | publisher          = Miller Freeman Books\n  | isbn                   = 0-87930-424-3\n  | page                  = 42\n}}</ref>  ''The Resurrection of Pigboy Crabshaw'' was Butterfield's highest charting album, reaching number 52 on the album chart.<ref name=\"Awards\"/>  On June 17, 1967, most of this lineup performed at the seminal Monterey Pop Festival.<ref>Billy Davenport played the drums and Keith Johnson contributed trumpet in place of David Sanborn on saxophone.

Such Muddy Waters' warhorses as \"[[Forty Days and Forty Nights]]\", \"[[I'm Ready (blues song)|I'm Ready]]\", \"[[Baby, Please Don't Go]]\", and \"[[Got My Mojo Working]]\" were recorded and later released on his ''[[Fathers and Sons (album)|Fathers and Sons]]'' album.

In 2009, Butterfield was included in the expanded 40th Anniversary Edition Woodstock video and an additional two songs appeared on the ''[[Woodstock: 40 Years On: Back to Yasgur's Farm]]'' box-set album.  With only Butterfield remaining from the original lineup, 1969's ''[[Keep On Moving (The Butterfield Blues Band album)|Keep On Moving]]'' album was produced by veteran R&B producer/songwriter [[Jerry Ragovoy]], reportedly brought in by Elektra to turn out a \"breakout commercial hit\".<ref name=\"Huey\"/>  The album was not embraced by critics or long-time fans;<ref>\n{{cite web\n  | last             = Campbell\n  | first            = Al\n  | title             = ''Keep on Moving'' \u2014 Album review\n  | work          = [[Allmusic]]\n  | publisher  = Rovi Corp.\n  | url               = http://www.allmusic.com/album/keep-on-moving-mw0000219077\n  | accessdate = July 23, 2013\n}}</ref> however, it reached number 102 in the ''Billboard'' album chart.<ref name=\"Awards\"/>\n\nA live double album by the Butterfield Blues Band, simply titled ''Live'', was recorded March 21\u201322, 1970 at the [[The Troubadour, West Hollywood|The Troubadour]] in West Hollywood, California.

According to his brother Peter, \n{{cquote|He listened to records and went places, but he also spent an awful lot of time, by himself, playing [harmonica].  He'd play outdoors.  There's a place called [[Promontory Point (Chicago)|The Point]] in Hyde Park [Chicago], a promentory of land that sticks out into Lake Michigan, and I can remember him out there for hours playing.  He was just playing all the time... It was a very solitary effort.

Paul was hard to be friends with.\"<ref name=\"Wolkin, Keenom 2000, p. 40\"/>  Although they later became close, Michael Bloomfield commented on his first impressions of Butterfield: \"He was a bad guy.  He carried pistols.  He was down there on the [[South Side, Chicago|South Side]], holding his own.  I was scared to death of that cat\".<ref>Wolkin, Keenom 2000, p. 93.</ref>  Writer and [[Allmusic]] founder [[Michael Erlewine]], who knew Butterfield during his early recording career, described him as \"always intense, somewhat remote, and even, on occasion, downright unfriendly\".<ref name=\"Erlewine p41\"/>  He remembered Butterfield as \"not much interested in other people\".<ref name=\"Erlewine p41\"/>\n\nBy 1971, Butterfield had purchased his first house in rural Woodstock, New York and began enjoying family life with his wife Kathy and infant son Lee.  According to Maria Muldaur, she and her husband were frequent dinner guests, which usually also involved sitting around a piano and singing songs.<ref name=\"Ellis\"/>  Although she doubted her abilities, \"it was Butter that first encouraged me to let loose and just sing the blues [and] not to worry about singing pretty or hitting all the right notes...  He loosened all the levels of self-consciousness and doubt out of me... And he'll forever live in my heart for that and for respecting me as a fellow musician.<ref name=\"Ellis\"/>\n\n==Death==\nBeginning in 1980, Paul Butterfield underwent several surgical procedures to relieve his [[peritonitis]], a serious and painful inflammation of the intestines.<ref name=\"Rolling Stone bio\"/>  Although he had been opposed to hard drugs as a bandleader, he began using painkillers, including heroin, which led to an addiction.  These problems and the drug-related death of his friend and one-time musical partner Mike Bloomfield weighed heavily on him.<ref name=\"Huey\"/>  On May 4, 1987 at age 44, Paul Butterfield died at his apartment in the North Hollywood district of Los Angeles. An autopsy by the county coroner concluded that he was the victim of an accidental drug overdose, with \"significant levels of morphine (heroin)...\"<ref name=\"LA Times\">\n{{cite journal\n | date             = June 13, 1987\n | title              = Musician's Death Laid to Overdose\n | journal        = Los Angeles Times\n | accessdate  = July 23, 2013\n | url                = http://articles.latimes.com/1987-06-13/news/mn-6920_1_drug-overdose\n}}</ref>\n\nBy the time of his death, Paul Butterfield was out of the commercial mainstream.  Although for some, he was very much the bluesman.  Maria Muldaur commented \"he had the whole sensibility and musicality and approach down pat...
