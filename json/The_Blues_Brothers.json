Belushi and Aykroyd, respectively in character as lead vocalist \"Joliet Jake\" Blues (named after [[Joliet Prison]]) and harmonica player/backing vocalist Elwood Blues (named after the [[Joliet Army Ammunition Plant|Elwood Ordnance Plant]], which made TNT and grenades during World War II), fronted the band, which was composed of well-known and respected musicians.

The band reformed in 1988 for a world tour and again in 1998 for a sequel film, ''[[Blues Brothers 2000]].''

In it, \"[[Howard Shore]] and his All-Bee Band\" play the [[Slim Harpo]] song \"[[I'm a King Bee]],\" with Belushi singing and Aykroyd playing harmonica, dressed in the bee costumes they wore for the \"Killer Bees\" sketch.\n\nFollowing tapings of ''SNL,'' it was popular among cast members and the weekly hosts to attend Aykroyd's Holland Tunnel Blues bar, which he had rented not long after joining the cast. Aykroyd and Belushi filled a jukebox with songs from many different artists such as [[Sam & Dave|Sam and Dave]] and [[Punk rock|punk]] band [[The Viletones]]. Belushi bought an amplifier and they kept some musical instruments there for anyone who wanted to jam. It was here that Aykroyd wrote and developed the original story which he then turned into the initial story draft of the ''Blues Brothers'' movie, better known as the \"tome\" because it contained so many pages.\n\nIt was also at the bar that Aykroyd introduced Belushi to the [[blues]]. An interest soon became a fascination and it was not long before the two began singing with local blues bands. Jokingly, ''SNL'' band leader [[Howard Shore]] suggested they call themselves \"The Blues Brothers\". In a 1988 interview in the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]],'' Aykroyd said the Blues Brothers act borrowed their \"duo thing and dancing\" from Sam & Dave and others, \"but the hats came from [[John Lee Hooker]]. The suits came from the concept that when you were a jazz player in the 40's, 50's 60's, to look straight, you had to wear a suit.\"<ref>Hoekstra, Dave. \"The New Soul Men: Sam & Dave - Aykroyd and Moore, in Memory of Jake, form Elwood Blues Review.\" ''The Chicago Sun-Times'' 29 May 1988: SHOW 1. Print.</ref>\n\nThe band was also modeled in part on Aykroyd's experience with the [[Downchild Blues Band]], one of the first professional blues bands in Canada, with whom Aykroyd continues to play on occasion.<ref>Aykroyd is playing with Downchild in the fall of 2009, during the band's 40th anniversary tour:  \"\u2026 when one thinks of blues music in Canada, the first name that springs to mind is DOWNCHILD. It's been 40 years since Donnie 'Mr. Downchild' Walsh and his late brother Hock formed the renowned group that would be the inspiration for the world famous Blues Brothers. DOWNCHILD plans to celebrate this anniversary in style, with some very special friends\u2014including blues brother and movie icon DAN AYKROYD and that's why they call it the Blues.\"  News Release, July 21, 2009; www.downchild.com.

Aykroyd has said of this time:\n\n{{quote|So I grew up (in Ottawa), in this capital city. My parents used to work for the government, and I went to elementary school, high school, and the university in the city. And there was a place on [[Sussex Drive (Ottawa)|Sussex Drive]] (Sussex Drive is where the Prime Minister's house is, right below [[Parliament Hill]]), and there was a little club there called Le Hibou, which in French means 'the owl.' And it was run by a gentleman named [[CHEZ-FM|Harvey Glatt]], and he brought every, and I mean every blues star that you or I would ever have wanted to have seen through Ottawa in the late 50s, well I guess more late 60s sort of, in around the Newport jazz rediscovery. I was going to Le Hibou and hearing [[James Cotton]], [[Otis Spann]], [[Pinetop Perkins]], and [[Muddy Waters]]. I actually jammed behind Muddy Waters. S. P. Leary left the drum kit one night, and Muddy said, 'Anybody out there play drums? I don't have a drummer.' And I walked on stage and we started, I don't know, [[Little Red Rooster]], something. He said, 'Keep that beat going, you make Muddy feel good.' And I heard [[Howlin' Wolf]] (Chester Burnett). Many, many times I saw Howlin' Wolf. And of course [[Buddy Guy]], Buddy Guy and [[Junior Wells]], [[Sonny Terry]] and [[Brownie McGhee]]. So I was exposed to all of these players, playing there as part of this scene to service the academic community in Ottawa, a very well-educated community. Had I lived in a different town I don't think that this would have happened, because it was just the confluence of educated government workers, and then also all the colleges in the area, [[University of Ottawa|Ottawa University]], Carleton, and all the schools\u2014these people were interested in blues culture.|<ref>[http://www.austinsound.net/author/roger-gatchet/page/2/ Still on a mission from God]; interview with Dan Aykroyd by Roger Gatchet, May 18, 2007, www.austinsound.net.</ref>}}\n\nThe [[Toronto]]-based Downchild Blues Band, co-founded in 1969 by two brothers, Donnie and [[Richard \"Hock\" Walsh]], served as an inspiration for the two Blues Brothers characters. Aykroyd initially modeled [[Elwood Blues]] in part on Donnie Walsh, a harmonica player and guitarist, while [[John Belushi]]'s [[Jake Blues]] character was modeled in part on Hock Walsh, Downchild's lead singer. In their first album as the Blues Brothers, ''[[Briefcase Full of Blues]]'' (1978), Aykroyd and Belushi featured three well-known Downchild songs closely associated with Hock Walsh's vocal style: \"I've Got Everything I Need (Almost),\" written by Donnie Walsh, \"Shot Gun Blues,\" co-written by Donnie and Hock Walsh, and \"Flip, Flop and Fly,\" co-written and originally popularized by [[Big Joe Turner]].<ref name = Slotekdon>[[Jim Slotek]], [http://jam.canoe.ca/Music/Artists/D/Downchild_Blues_Band/2000/02/04/744667.html Bye to blues brother: Downchild's Donnie Walsh talks about late sibling], Jam! Music, February 4, 2000; www.jam.canoe.ca.</ref>  All three songs were contained in Downchild's second album, ''Straight Up'' (1973), with \"Flip, Flop and Fly\" becoming the band's most successful single, in 1974.\n\nBelushi's budding interest in the blues solidified in October 1977 when he was in [[Eugene, Oregon|Eugene]], Oregon, filming ''[[National Lampoon's Animal House]].'' He went to a local hotel to hear 25-year-old blues singer/harmonica player [[Curtis Salgado]]. After the show, Belushi and Salgado talked about the blues for hours. Belushi found Salgado's enthusiasm infectious. In an interview at the time with the ''[[Eugene Register-Guard]],'' he said:\n{{quote|I was growing sick of [[rock and roll]], it was starting to bore me \u2026 and I hated [[disco]], so I needed some place to go. I hadn't heard much blues before. It felt good.}}\n\nSalgado lent him some albums by [[Floyd Dixon]], [[Charles Brown (musician)|Charles Brown]], [[Johnny \"Guitar\" Watson]], and others. Belushi was hooked.<ref>This is detailed in an article in the January 4, 1979, edition of the ''[[Eugene Register-Guard]].''</ref>\n\nBelushi began to appear with Salgado on stage, singing the Floyd Dixon song \"Hey, Bartender\" on a few occasions, and using Salgado's humorous alternate lyrics to \"I Don't Know\":\n{{quote|I said Woman, you going to walk a mile for a [[Camel (cigarette)|Camel]]<br />\nOr are you going to make like Mr. [[Chesterfield (cigarette)|Chesterfield]] and satisfy?<br />\nShe said that all depends on what you're packing<br />\nRegular or king-size<br />\nThen she pulled out my [[Jim Beam]], and to her surprise<br />\nIt was every bit as hard as my [[Canadian Club]]}}\n\nThese lyrics were used again for the band's debut performance on ''SNL''. This took place on the episode of April 22, 1978 (hosted by [[Steve Martin]]), where, in the cold open, [[Don Kirshner]] (played by [[Paul Shaffer]]) describes how Marshall Checkers of Checkers Records called him on a hot new blues act, and how with the help of \"Neshui Wexler and Jerry Ertegun\" (a play on the names of record industry executives [[Jerry Wexler]] and [[Nesuhi Ertegun]]), they were no longer regarded as an authentic blues band, but \"a viable commercial product.\" The Blues Brothers then performed \"Hey Bartender.\" Due to Shaffer's involvement in the sketch, keyboards were played for this performance by Cheryl Hardwick.\n\n===Band formation===\nWith the help of pianist-arranger [[Paul Shaffer]], Belushi and Aykroyd started assembling a collection of studio talents to form their own band. These included ''SNL'' band members, saxophonist \"Blue\" [[Lou Marini]] and trombonist-saxophonist [[Tom Malone (musician)|Tom Malone]], who had previously played in [[Blood, Sweat & Tears]]. At Shaffer's suggestion, guitarist [[Steve Cropper]] and bassist [[Donald \"Duck\" Dunn]], the powerhouse combo from [[Booker T and the M.G.'s]] and subsequently almost every hit out of Memphis's [[Stax Records]] during the 1960s, were signed as well.<ref>In his biography of Belushi, ''[[Wired (book)|Wired: The Short Life and Fast Times of John Belushi]],'' [[Bob Woodward]] learned, from the numerous interviews he conducted, that Belushi recruited Cropper and Dunn by \"alternating good-natured jokes and hard sell.\"</ref>\n\nBelushi wanted a powerful trumpet player and a hot blues guitarist, so [[Juilliard]]-trained trumpeter [[Alan Rubin]] was brought in, as was guitarist [[Matt Murphy (blues guitarist)|Matt Murphy]], who had performed with many blues legends.\n\nFor the brothers' look, Belushi borrowed [[John Lee Hooker]]'s trademark [[Ray-Ban Wayfarer]] sunglasses and [[soul patch]].\n\n===Sound===\nWhile the music of the Blues Brothers is based on R&B, blues, and [[soul music|soul]], it also drew heavily on rock and [[jazz]] elements, usually taking a blues standard and bringing a rock sound and style to it. The band could be drawn into three sections: the four-man horn section, the traditional rock instruments of the five-man rhythm section, and the two singing brothers. The sound of the band was a synthesis of two different traditions: the horn players all came from the clean, precise, jazz-influenced sound of New York City; while the rhythm section came from the grittier soul and blues sound of [[Chicago blues|Chicago]] and [[Memphis blues|Memphis]]. The success of this meld was due both to Shaffer's arrangements and to the musicians' talents. Belushi, technically, did not have a good voice; he compensated for this by throwing his heart and his soul into his singing, from which approach the power of the blues is said to come.\n\nIn ''Stories Behind the Making of The Blues Brothers,'' a 1998 documentary included on some DVD editions of the first ''Blues Brothers'' film, Cropper noted that some of his peers thought that he and the other musicians backing the Blues Brothers were [[sell out|selling out]] to Hollywood or using a gimmick to make some quick money. Cropper responded by stating that he thought Belushi was as good as or better than many of the singers he had backed. He also noted that Belushi had, early in his career, briefly been a professional drummer, and had an especially keen sense of rhythm.\n\n===Albums, early gigs, character backgrounds===\nThe Blues Brothers recorded their first album, ''[[Briefcase Full of Blues]],'' in 1978 after comedian [[Steve Martin]] asked them to open for him at Los Angeles' [[Gibson Amphitheatre|Universal Amphitheatre]]. The same year that Belushi's ''National Lampoon's Animal House'' became a #1 box office hit, the album reached #1 on the [[Billboard 200]],<ref name=\"snl20050220\">{{cite episode | title=Live From New York: The First 5 Years of Saturday Night Live | network=NBC | airdate=2005-02-20}}</ref> went [[RIAA certification|double platinum]], and featured [[Top 40]] hit recordings of [[Sam and Dave]]'s \"[[Soul Man (song)|Soul Man]]\" and [[The Chips]]' \"[[Rubber Biscuit]],\" the latter of which featured Aykroyd's \"talk-singing.\"\n\nThe album liner notes fleshed out the fictional back story of Jake and Elwood, having them growing up in a Roman Catholic [[orphanage]] in [[Rock Island, Illinois|Rock Island]], Illinois and learning the blues from a janitor named Curtis. Their [[blood brother]]hood was sealed by cutting their middle fingers with a string said to come from the guitar of [[Elmore James]].<ref>[http://www.fortunecity.com/tinpan/fitzgerald/12/bio.html Biography of the Blues Brothers from their album, A Briefcase Full of Blues], retrieved on November 30, 2006.</ref>\n\nThe band, along with the [[New Riders of the Purple Sage]], opened for [[the Grateful Dead]] for the final show at [[Winterland]], New Year's Eve 1978.\n\nWith the film came the [[Blues Brothers w/ Ray Charles|soundtrack album]], which was the band's first studio album. \"[[Gimme Some Lovin']]\" was a Top 40 hit and the band toured to promote the film, which led to a third album (and second live album), ''[[Made in America (Blues Brothers album)|Made in America]],'' recorded at the Universal Amphitheatre in 1980. The track \"Who's Making Love\" peaked at No 39. It was the last recording the band would make with Belushi's Jake Blues.\n\nBelushi's wife, Judith Jacklin, and his friend, Tino Insana, wrote a book, ''[[Blues Brothers: Private]],'' that further fleshed out the Blues Brothers' universe and gave a back story for the first movie.\n\nIn 1981, ''[[Best of the Blues Brothers]]'' was released, with a previously unreleased track, a version of [[The Soul Survivors]]' \"[[Expressway to Your Heart]]\", and alternate live recordings of \"Everybody Needs Somebody to Love\" and \"Rubber Biscuit;\" this album would be the first of several compilations and hits collections issued over the years. A 1998 British CD compilation, ''The Complete Blues Brothers,'' exclusively features [[Lamont Cranston (Band)|Lamont Cranston's]] \"Excuse Moi Mon Cheri,\" from the L.A. ''Briefcase'' recordings, originally available only as the [[A-side and B-side|b-side]] to the \"Soul Man\" 45 rpm single.\n\nOn March 5, 1982, John Belushi died in [[Hollywood]] of an accidental overdose of [[Speedball (drug)|heroin and cocaine]].\n\nAfter John Belushi's death, updated versions of the Blues Brothers have performed on ''SNL'' and for charitable and political causes. Aykroyd has been accompanied by [[James Belushi]] and [[John Goodman]] in character as \"Zee\" Blues and \"Mighty Mack\" McTeer. The copyright owners have also authorized some copycat acts to perform under the Blues Brothers name; one such act performs regularly at the [[Universal Studios Florida]] theme park in [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]], Florida and [[Universal Studios Hollywood]].\n\nIn 1997, an animated sitcom with Jake and Elwood was planned, but scrapped after only eight episodes were produced.<ref>[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0472243/episodes ''The Blues Brothers Animated Series'' (1997) \u2013 Episode list<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nTo promote ''[[Blues Brothers 2000]]'' (1998), Dan Aykroyd, James Belushi and John Goodman performed at the halftime of [[Super Bowl XXXI]], along with [[ZZ Top]] and [[James Brown]]. The performance was preceded with a faux news report stating the Blues Brothers had escaped custody and were on their way to the [[Louisiana Superdome]].\n\nAykroyd has continued to be an active proponent of blues music and parlayed this avocation into foundation and partial ownership of the [[House of Blues]] franchise, a national chain of nightclubs.\n\nJohn Belushi's brother, [[James Belushi]], toured with the band for a short time as \"Zee Blues,\" and recorded the album, ''[[Blues Brothers & Friends: Live from House of Blues]],'' with Dan Aykroyd, but he did not appear in ''[[Blues Brothers 2000]].'' It is rumored that he was approached to play not the role of \"Mighty Mack\" (played by [[John Goodman]]), but the role of the local Sheriff \"Cab\" Chamberlain, which eventually went to [[Joe Morton]]. Jim would later reunite with Aykroyd to record yet another album, not as the Blues Brothers but as themselves: ''Belushi/Aykroyd \u2013 Have Love Will Travel'' (Big Men-Big Music).\n\nIn 2004, the musical, ''The Blues Brothers Revival,'' premiered in Chicago. The story was about Elwood trying to rescue Jake from an eternity in [[limbo]]/[[purgatory]]. The musical was written and composed with approval and permission from both the John Belushi estate (including his widow, Judith Belushi-Pisano) and Dan Aykroyd.\n\n==Recent lineup==\n[[File:Jonny Rosch Hanwell Carnival 2011 4211.jpeg|thumb|Jonny Rosch, recent lead singer (2011 solo performance)]]\nThe Blues Brothers featuring Elwood and Zee regularly perform at [[House of Blues]] venues and various casinos across North America. They are usually backed by [[James Belushi]]'s Sacred Hearts Band. The rest of the Blues Brothers Band tours the world regularly. The only original members still in the band are [[Steve Cropper]] and [[Lou Marini]]. The lead singer is Jonny \"The Rock & Roll Doctor\" Rosch, and they are frequently joined by [[Eddie Floyd]].\n\nAykroyd currently reprises his character, Elwood Blues, as the host of the weekly ''[[House of Blues]] Radio Hour,'' heard nationwide on the [[Dial Global]] Radio Network.\n\n==Films==\n\n===''The Blues Brothers''===\n{{main|The Blues Brothers (film)}}\n\nIn 1980, '''''The Blues Brothers,''''' directed by [[John Landis]], was released. Featuring [[car chase]]s involving the [[Bluesmobile]] and musical performances by [[Aretha Franklin]], [[James Brown]], [[Cab Calloway]], [[Ray Charles]] and [[John Lee Hooker]], the story is set in and around [[Chicago]], Illinois. It is a tale of [[Redemption (religious)|redemption]] for the [[parole]]d [[convict]] Joliet Jake Blues and his brother Elwood as they decide to take on a \"mission from God\" and reform their blues band in order to raise funds to save the Catholic [[orphanage]] where they grew up. Along the way, the brothers are targeted by a \"mystery woman\" ([[Carrie Fisher]]) and chased by the [[Illinois State Police]], a [[country music|country and western]] band called the Good Ol' Boys, the owner of Bob's Country Bunker, and \"[[Illinois Nazis]].\" The film grossed $57&nbsp;million domestically in its theatrical release, making it the 10th highest grossing movie of 1980, and grossed an additional $58&nbsp;million in foreign release.<ref name=\"BOM\">{{cite web | title=Box Office Mojo | work=The Blues Brothers | url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=bluesbrothers.htm | accessdate=August 2, 2008}}</ref> It is the second-highest grossing [[Saturday Night Live#Films|film based on a ''Saturday Night Live'' sketch]] (only 1992's ''[[Wayne's World (film)|Wayne's World]]'' having grossed more) and the twelfth-highest grossing [[musical film]].<ref name=\"BOM\"/>\n\n===''Blues Brothers 2000''===\n{{main|Blues Brothers 2000}}\nWith Landis again directing, the sequel to ''The Blues Brothers'' was made in 1998. It fared considerably worse than its predecessor with fans and critics, though it is more ambitious in terms of musical performances by the band and has a more extensive roster of [[guest artist]]s than the first film. The story picks up 18 years later with Elwood being released from prison, and learning that his brother, Jake Blues, has died. He is once again prevailed upon to save some orphans, and with a 10-year-old boy named [[Buster Blues]] ([[J. Evan Bonifant]]) in tow, Elwood again sets about the task of reuniting his band. He recruits some new singers, Mighty Mack ([[John Goodman]]) and Cab ([[Joe Morton]]), a policeman who was Curtis' son. All the original band members are found, as well as some performers from the first film, including [[Aretha Franklin]] and [[James Brown]]. There are dozens of other guest performers, including [[Eric Clapton]], [[Steve Winwood]], [[Junior Wells]], [[Lonnie Brooks]], [[Eddie Floyd]], [[Wilson Pickett]], [[Isaac Hayes]], [[Sam Moore]], [[Taj Mahal (musician)|Taj Mahal]] and [[Jonny Lang]], [[Blues Traveler]], as well as an all-star [[supergroup (music)|supergroup]] led by [[B. B. King]] called [[the Louisiana Gator Boys]]. On the run from the police, [[Russian mafia]] and a [[racism|racist]] [[militia]], the band eventually ends up in [[Louisiana]], where they enter a [[battle of the bands]] overseen by a [[Louisiana Voodoo|voodoo]] practitioner named Queen Moussette ([[Erykah Badu]]). During a song by the Blues Brothers (a [[Caribbean music|Caribbean]] number called \"Funky Nassau\"), a character played by [[Paul Shaffer]] asks to cut in on keyboards, which Murph allows. This marks the first time in a film that the Blues Brothers play with their original keyboardist.\n\n==Video games==\n{{main|The Blues Brothers (video game)}}\nA video game involving the characters was made for various [[video game consoles|platforms]] by [[Titus Software|Titus]]. The same company produced another video game for the [[Amiga]], [[Game Boy]], [[Personal computer|PC]] and [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super NES]]. A [[Nintendo 64]] game titled ''[[Blues Brothers 2000 (video game)|Blues Brothers 2000]]'' was also released. The game was extremely difficult, had little to do with the film and was poorly received.\n\n==The Blues Brothers Bar==\nThe Blues Brothers Bar was an illegal backhouse tavern started by John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd, on [[Wells Street (Chicago)|Wells Street]] in Chicago's [[Old Town, Chicago|Old Town]], across the street from [[The Second City]] and in back of the Earl of Old Town night club. It was run by one of Belushi's friends from [[College of DuPage]]. As the bar was unlicensed, alcohol was bought by the purchase of 'tickets' which were then traded to the bartender for drinks. The bar was discovered by authorities in 1982 and forced to close shortly after.\n\nIn the DVD commentary of the film ''[[Thief (film)|Thief]]'' (filmed in Chicago in 1981), [[James Caan]] mentions the bar.\n\n==Discography==\n\n===Albums===\n* ''[[Briefcase Full of Blues]]'' (1978) [[Billboard Top 200|US]] #1\n* ''[[The Blues Brothers (film)#Soundtrack|The Blues Brothers: Music from the Soundtrack]]'' (1980) US #13\n* ''[[Made in America (The Blues Brothers album)|Made in America]]'' (1980) US #49\n* ''[[Best of The Blues Brothers]]'' (1981) US #143\n* ''[[Dancin' wid da Blues Brothers]]'' (1983)\n* ''[[Everybody Needs the Blues Brothers]]'' (1988)\n* ''[[The Blues Brothers Band Live in Montreux]]'' (1990)\n* ''[[Red, White & Blues]]'' (1992)\n* ''[[The Definitive Collection (Blues Brothers album)|The Definitive Collection]]'' (1992)\n* ''[[The Very Best of The Blues Brothers]]'' (1995)\n* ''[[Blues Brothers and Friends: Live from Chicago's House of Blues]]'' (1997)\n* ''[[Blues Brothers 2000 (soundtrack)|Blues Brothers 2000: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack]]'' (1998)\n* ''[[The Blues Brothers Complete]]'' (2000)\n* ''[[The Essentials (Blues Brothers album)|The Essentials]]'' (2003)\n\n===Charted Singles===\n* \"[[Soul Man (song)|Soul Man]]\" (1978) [[Billboard Hot 100|US]] #14, [[UK Singles Chart|UK]] #79 (1990)\n* \"[[Rubber Biscuit]]\" (1978) US #37\n* \"[[Gimme Some Lovin']]\" (1980) US #18\n* \"[[Who's Making Love]]\" (1980) US #39\n* \"[[Everybody Needs Somebody to Love]]\" (1990) UK #12\n\n==Videography==\n* \"Things We Did Last Summer\" (1978)\n* \"The Blues Brothers\" (1980)\n* \"The Return of The Blues Brothers\" (1998)\n* \"Blues Brothers 2000\" (2000)\n* \"The Best of The Blues Brothers\" (2002)\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wikiquote|The Blues Brothers}}\n*[http://www.bluesbrothers.com/ Official DVD site]\n*[http://www.bluesbrotherscentral.com/ Fan Site]\n*{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p3721|label=The Blues Brothers}}\n*[http://www.thebluesmobile.com/ House of Blues Radio Hour (Hosted by Dan Aykroyd)]\n* [http://c4.libsyn.com/media/18705/tsoya111905.mp3 Interview (MP3) with John Belushi biographer Tanner Colby and widow Judith Belushi Pisano] on the public radio program [[The Sound of Young America]] regarding their book, \"Belushi\".
