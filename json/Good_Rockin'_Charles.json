In 1955 he settled on working in the backing band for the blues singer, Jimmy Rogers.  Two years later, the short-lived [[independent record label]], [[Cobra Records]], offered Charles the opportunity to record his own work.  However, Charles turned it down.<ref name=\"AMG\"/> \n\nThis wariness of working in a [[recording studio]], had earlier seen him replaced at the last minute, as the harmonica player on Jimmy Rogers recording of \"Walking by Myself\" (1956).
