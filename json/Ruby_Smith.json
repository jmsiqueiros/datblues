She was a niece, by marriage, of the better known [[Bessie Smith]], who discouraged Ruby from a recording career. Nevertheless, following Bessie's death in 1937, Ruby went on to record twenty-one sides between 1938 and 1947.  She is also known for her recorded explicit, and candid observations, on her own and Bessie's lifestyle.<ref name=\"AMG\"/><ref name=\"Joseph\">{{cite book\n| first= Gloria I.\n| last= Joseph\n| year= 1981\n| title= Common differences: conflicts in black and white feminist perspectives\n| edition= 1st\n| publisher= South End Press \n| location= [[Boston, Massachusetts]]\n| isbn= 0-89608-317-9\n| pages= 183/4}}</ref> \n\n==Biography==\nShe was born '''Ruby Walker''' in [[New York City|New York]], [[United States]].<ref name=\"AMG\">{{cite web |url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p126522|pure_url=yes}}|title=Ruby Smith|author=arwulf arwulf |publisher=[[Allmusic]] |accessdate=October 9, 2011}}</ref>\n \nShe met Bessie Smith in [[Philadelphia]], and after her aunt (by marriage) made her debut recording in February 1923, Ruby joined her on tour in 1924.  Ruby assisted off-stage with costume changes, and provided entertainment in the intermissions with her dancing. Although Ruby's thoughts of a career as a singer were initially thwarted in 1926 by Bessie's insistence, Ruby continued to travel with Bessie on tour. In [[Atlanta, Georgia]], Ruby spent a night in the cells after being discovered bringing [[moonshine]] for her aunt to consume. In 1927, Ruby was part of the female entourage led by Bessie to the 'buffet flats' in [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]]. Her lengthy recorded interview given to [[Chris Albertson]], contained references to this time and others,<ref name=\"Joseph\"/> and the recording became part of Bessie Smith's ''The Complete Recordings, Vol. 5: The Final Chapter'' [[box set]].<ref name=\"AMG\"/><ref>{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r232718/review|pure_url=yes}} |title=Allmusic ((( ''The Complete Recordings, Vol. 5: The Final Chapter'' > Review )))}}</ref> Of a particularly \"open house\" sex show, Smith said, \"People used to pay good just to go in there and see him do his act.\"<ref name=\"Chauncey\">George Chauncey, ''Gay New York: gender, urban culture, and the making of the gay male world, 1890-1940'', pp. 250-253, Chapter 8, notes 71, 78 (New York: Basic Books, a division of [[HarperCollins]], 1994).

However, the deception did not last long, and in the event Bessie died in 1937.<ref name=\"AMG\"/> Shortly afterwards, she adopted the [[stage name]] of Ruby Smith, and less than a year later recorded six tracks including a [[cover version]] of Bessie's \"Send Me to the 'Lectric Chair Blues.\"  At the same session she waxed her version of the [[Alex Hill (musician)|Alex Hill]] penned, \"Draggin' My Heart Around.\"<ref name=\"AMG\"/>\n\nIn March 1939, Smith under the musical direction of [[James P. Johnson]], recorded \"He's Mine, All Mine,\" and the Bessie Smith co-composition with Johnson, \"Backwater Blues\". In December 1941, and backed by an [[musical ensemble|ensemble]] led by [[Sammy Price]], she recorded two more tracks, \"Why Don't You Love Me Anymore?\" and her own song, \"Harlem Gin Blues\".  Her final recording sessions took place in August 1946 and in January the following year, when she was backed by [[Gene Sedric]]'s band.<ref name=\"AMG\"/>\n\nSmith died on March 24, 1977, in [[Anaheim, California]], at the age of 73.<ref name=\"AMG\"/>\n\nHer recorded work has been made available on several [[compilation album]]s, including ''Jazzin' the Blues (1943-1952)'', released by [[Document Records]] in 2000.<ref>{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r535402/review|pure_url=yes}} |title=Allmusic ((( ''Jazzin' the Blues (1943-1952)'' > Review )))}}</ref>\n\n==Recordings==\n{{Expand list|date=October 2011}}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!
