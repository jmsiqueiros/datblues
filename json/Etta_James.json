James referred to her mother as \"the Mystery Lady\".<ref name=Icon/>\n\nJames received her first professional vocal training at age five from James Earle Hines, musical director of the Echoes of Eden choir, at the St. Paul Baptist Church in south central Los Angeles. She became a popular singing attraction there, and Sarge tried to pressure the church into paying him for her singing but they refused. During drunken poker games at home, he would often wake James up in the early hours of the morning and force her through beatings to sing for his friends. As she was a bed-wetter, and often soaked with her own urine on these occasions, the trauma of being forced to sing meant she had a lifelong reluctance to sing on demand.<ref>{{cite book |url= http://books.google.com/books?id=4-5UFUZgAIQC&pg=PA43&dq=creolettes+etta+james&hl=en&ei=yjnYTeiXL4bAswajltH3Ag&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=3&ved=0CD4Q6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=creolettes%20etta%20james&f=false |title=Rage to Survive: the Etta James Story  |author=Etta James, David Ritz|page=20|publisher=Da Capo Press, 2003 |accessdate=May 21, 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn 1950, Mama Lu died, and James' biological mother took her to the [[Fillmore District, San Francisco]].<ref>{{cite book |url= http://books.google.com/books?id=4-5UFUZgAIQC&pg=PA31&dq=your+mother+has+passed+etta+james&hl=en&ei=Ez_YTfjROcT1sgaMxPj3Ag&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CCkQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=Rage to Survive: the Etta James Story  |author=Etta James, David Ritz|page=31|publisher=Da Capo Press, 2003 |accessdate=May 21, 2011}}</ref> Within a couple of years, James began listening to [[doo-wop]] and was inspired to form a [[girl group]], called the Creolettes (due to the members' light skinned complexions). The 14-year-old girl met musician [[Johnny Otis]]. Stories on how they met vary including Otis' version in which James had come to his hotel after one of his performances in the city and persuaded him to audition her. Another story came that Otis spotted the group performing at a Los Angeles nightclub and sought them to record his \"[[answer song]]\" to [[Hank Ballard]]'s \"[[Work with Me, Annie]]\". Nonetheless, Otis took the group under his wing, helping them sign to [[Modern Records]] and changing their name from the Creolettes to the Peaches and gave the singer her stage name reversing Jamesetta into \"Etta James\". James recorded the version, which she was allowed to co-author, in 1954, and the song was released in early 1955 as \"[[The Wallflower (Dance with Me, Henry)|Dance with Me, Henry]]\". Originally the name of the song was \"Roll With Me, Henry\" but was changed to avoid censorship due to the subtle title. In February of that year, the song reached number one on the [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs|Hot Rhythm & Blues Tracks]] chart.<ref name=\"rockhall.com\"/> Its success gave the group an opening spot on [[Little Richard]]'s national tour.<ref name=\"whitepp68,78\">White, Charles (2003), pp. 68, 78.

Omnibus Press.</ref>\n\nWhile on tour with Richard, pop singer [[Georgia Gibbs]] recorded her version of James' song, which was released under the title \"The Wallflower\", and became a [[crossover (music)|crossover]] hit, reaching number one on the [[Billboard Hot 100]], which angered James. After leaving the Peaches, James had another R&B hit with \"Good Rockin' Daddy\", but struggled with follow-ups. When her contract with Modern came up in 1960, she decided to sign with [[Leonard Chess]]' namesake label, [[Chess Records]], and shortly afterwards got involved in a relationship with singer [[Harvey Fuqua]], founder of the doo-wop group, [[The Moonglows]].\n\nBobby Murray, aka \"Taters\", toured with Etta James for 20 years.  He wrote that James had her first hit single when she was 15 years of age and went steady with [[B.B. King]] when she was 16.

In early 1961, James released what was to become her signature song, \"[[At Last]]\", which reached number two on the R&B chart and number 47 on the [[Billboard Hot 100]]. Though the song was not as successful as expected, it has become the most remembered version of the song.<ref name=\"rollingstone\"/> James followed that up with \"Trust in Me\", which also included string instruments.<ref name=\"allmusic\"/> Later that same year, James released a second studio album, ''[[The Second Time Around (Etta James album)|The Second Time Around]]''.

After a period of isolation, James returned to recording in 1967 and reemerged with more gutsy R&B numbers thanks to her recording at the legendary Fame Studios in [[Muscle Shoals, Alabama]] releasing her comeback hit \"Tell Mama\", which was co-written by [[Clarence Carter]], and reached number ten R&B and number twenty three pop.

She wrote in her autobiography ''Rage To Survive'' that she heard the song outlined by her friend Ellington \"Fugi\" Jordan when she visited him in prison.<ref>Etta James and David Ritz, ''Rage To Survive'', 1995, ISBN 0-306-80812-9.</ref> According to her account, she wrote the rest of the song with Jordan, but for tax reasons gave her songwriting credit to her partner at the time, [[Billy Foster]].\n\nFollowing this success, James became an in-demand concert performer though she never again reached the heyday of her early to mid-1960s success. She continued to chart in the R&B Top 40 in the early 1970s with singles such as \"Losers Weepers\" (1970) and \"I Found a Love\" (1972). Though James continued to record for Chess, she was devastated by the death of Chess founder Leonard Chess in 1969.  James ventured into rock and [[funk]] with the release of her self-titled album in 1973 with production from famed rock producer [[Gabriel Mekler]], who had worked with [[Steppenwolf (band)|Steppenwolf]] and [[Janis Joplin]], who had admired James and had covered \"Tell Mama\" in concert. The album, known for its mixtures of musical styles, was nominated for a [[Grammy Award]].<ref name=\"oldies\"/> The album did not produce any major hits, neither did the follow-up, ''Out On the Street Again'', in 1974, though like ''Etta James'' before it, the album was also critically acclaimed. James continued to record for Chess releasing two more albums in 1978, ''Etta Is Betta Than Evah'' and ''Deep in the Night'', which saw the singer incorporating more rock-based music in her repertoire.<ref name=\"allmusic\"/> That same year, James was the opening act for [[The Rolling Stones]] and also performed at the [[Montreal International Jazz Festival]]. Following this brief success, however, she left Chess Records and did not record for another ten years as she struggled with drug addiction and alcoholism.\n\n==Later career: 1988\u20132012==\n[[File:Etta James04.JPG|thumbnail|Etta James in Normandie France, July 20, 1990]]\nThough she continued to perform, little was heard of Etta James until 1987 when she was seen performing \"[[Rock & Roll Music]]\" with [[Chuck Berry]] on his \"[[Hail! Hail! Rock 'n' Roll]]\" documentary. In 1989, James signed with [[Island Records]] and released the album ''Seven Year Itch''. The album was produced by [[Barry Beckett]]. She released a second album, also produced by Barry Beckett, in 1989 titled ''Stickin' to My Guns''. Both albums were recorded at FAME Studios.<ref name=\"oldies\"/> Also in 1989 James filmed a live concert from the [[Wiltern Theater]] in [[Los Angeles]] with [[Joe Walsh]] and [[Albert Collins]], \"[[Jazzvisions]]: Jump The Blues Away\". Backing musicians consisted of many top-flight players from LA: Rick Rosas (bass); [[Michael Huey]] (drums); Ed Sanford (B3); Kip Noble (piano); and Etta's longtime guitar player Josh Sklair (guitar). James participated in rap singer [[Def Jef]] for the song \"Droppin' Rhymes on Drums\", which mixed James' jazz vocals with hip-hop.

Three years later she issued the Christmas album ''Etta James Christmas'' in 1998.<ref name=\"allmusic\"/>\n\nBy the mid-1990s, James' earlier classic music was included in commercials including, most notably, \"[[I Just Wanna Make Love to You]]\". Due to exposure of the song in a UK commercial, the song reached the top ten of the UK charts in 1996.<ref name=\"rockhall.com\"/> Continuing to record for Private Music, she released the blues album ''Matriarch of the Blues'' in 2000, which had James returning to her R&B roots with ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' hailing it as a \"solid return to roots\", further stating that the album found the singer \"reclaiming her throne\u2014and defying anyone to knock her off it\".<ref name=\"musicianguide\"/> In 2001, she was inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame and the [[Rockabilly Hall of Fame]], the latter for her contributions to the developments of both rock and roll music and [[rockabilly]].

However, after leaving treatment, her substance abuse continued after she developed a relationship with a man who was also using drugs.
