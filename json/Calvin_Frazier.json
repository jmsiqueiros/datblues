Frazier''' (February 16, 1915 &ndash; September 23, 1972)<ref name=\"Dead\"/> was an [[United States|American]] [[Detroit blues]] and [[country blues]] [[guitarist]], [[singing|singer]] and [[songwriter]]. Despite leaving a fragmented recording history, both as a singer and guitarist, Frazier was an associate of [[Robert Johnson (musician)|Robert Johnson]], and recorded alongside [[Johnny Shines]], Sampson Pittman, T.J. Fowler, [[Alberta Adams]], Jimmy Milner, [[Baby Boy Warren]], [[Boogie Woogie Red]], and latterly [[Washboard Willie]]. His early work was recorded by the [[Library of Congress]] (now preserved by the [[National Recording Registry]]) prior to the outbreak of [[World War II]], although his more commercial period took place between 1949 and 1956.<ref name=\"AMG\">{{cite web |url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p168504/biography|pure_url=yes}}|title=Calvin Frazier |author=Ankeny, Jason|publisher=[[Allmusic]] |accessdate=May 25, 2010}}</ref><ref name=\"Wirz\">{{cite web|url=http://www.wirz.de/music/frazifrm.htm |title=Calvin Frazier discography |publisher=Wirz.de |date= |accessdate=May 25, 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Biography==\nFrazier was born in [[Osceola, Arkansas|Osceola]], [[Arkansas]],<ref name=\"Dead\"/> and originally performed with his own brothers. Befriending  Johnny Shines, in 1930 they jointly travelled to [[Helena, Arkansas]] where they met Robert Johnson.  The threesome moved on to [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]], with Frazier bringing his wife Gussie Mae and their children.  Here they performed hymns on local [[radio station]]s. Frazier and Johnson returned south where they played along with the [[drummer]], James 'Peck' Curtis.<ref name=\"AMG\"/>\n\nIn 1935, Frazier was involved in a dispute in [[Memphis, Tennessee]], where he was wounded, and his only brother and another man shot dead. Frazier returned to Detroit with his wife, but then wed Shines' cousin resulting in an invalid marriage. He played guitar as an accompanist to [[Big Maceo Merriweather]], [[Sonny Boy Williamson II]] and [[Baby Boy Warren]] before being recorded in 1938 by the [[Folkloristics|folklorist]] Alan Lomax for the [[Library of Congress]].  His recordings included \"Lily Mae\", dedicated to his wife and which was a revised version of Johnson's \"Honeymoon Blues\"; and \"Highway 51\", another variant, this time of Johnson's track, \"[[Dust My Broom]]\".<ref name=\"AMG\"/>\n\nHis unique style combined [[slide guitar]] work with unusual lyrics, and a vocal phrasing that was difficult to decipher.<ref name=\"AMG\"/> He released three [[single (music)|singles]] under his own name in 1949 and 1951 on the Alben and New Song [[record label|labels]], including \"Got Nobody To Tell My Troubles To\", which he recorded in [[Toledo, Ohio|Toledo]], [[Ohio]] in 1951.<ref name=\"Wirz\"/> Between 1951 and 1953, Frazier was a recording member of T.J. Fowler's [[jump blues]] combo, then recorded with Warren in 1954, whilst his final sessions in the [[recording studio|studio]] appear to be in 1956 backing [[Washboard Willie]].<ref name=\"Wirz\"/> Without any tangible success on [[Gramophone record|record]] or otherwise,  Frazier nevertheless performed around Detroit taking his youngest daughter Carol Frazier along on his venture's until his death.<ref name=\"AMG\"/> \n\nCalvin Frazier died in Detroit of [[cancer]] in September 1972, at the age of 57.<ref name=\"Dead\">{{cite web|author=Doc Rock |url=http://thedeadrockstarsclub.com/1970.html |title=The 1970s |publisher=The Dead Rock Stars Club |date= |accessdate=2014-01-26}}</ref>\n\nHis most notable work was \"This Old World's in a Tangle\"; both the title of the first song he recorded, and of the [[compilation album]] issued by [[Laurie Records]] in 1993, which included some of his earliest work.<ref name=\"Wirz\"/><ref name=\"LP\"/> Nine of his full length original recordings were included in the [[JSP Records]] 2005 compilation, ''Detroit Blues: Blues from the Motor City 1938\u20131954''.<ref name=\"Compilation\">{{cite web|author=Marisa Brown |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/detroit-blues-blues-from-the-motor-city-1938-1954-mw0000633441 |title=Detroit Blues: Blues from the Motor City 1938-1954 - Various Artists &#124; Songs, Reviews, Credits, Awards |publisher=AllMusic |date= |accessdate=2014-01-26}}</ref> \n\nIn 2009, the Detroit Blues Society instigated an appeal to raise monies to mark Frazier's previously unmarked grave with a headstone.<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.americantowns.com/mi/goodrich/news/calvin-frazier-headstone-project-176068 |title=Calvin Frazier Headstone Project - Goodrich, MI |publisher=Americantowns.com |date=2009-03-31 |accessdate=2014-01-26}}</ref>  By December that year a granite slab was in place.<ref>[http://www.detroitbluessociety.org/Memorials/Memorials.html ]{{dead link|date=January 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Compilation albums==\n*''This Old World's in a Tangle'' (1993) - [[Laurie Records|Laurie]]<ref name=\"LP\">{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/calvin-frazier-mn0000653788/discography |title=Calvin Frazier &#124; Discography |publisher=AllMusic |date= |accessdate=2014-01-26}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Biography}}\n*[[List of Detroit blues musicians]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.wirz.de/music/frazifrm.htm Comprehensive discography at Wirz.de]\n\n{{Authority control|VIAF=28745417}}\n{{Persondata<!-- Metadata: see [[Wikipedia:Persondata]] -->\n| NAME              =Frazier, Calvin\n| ALTERNATIVE NAMES =\n| SHORT DESCRIPTION =[[United States|American]] [[Detroit blues]] and [[country blues]] guitarist, singer and songwriter\n| DATE OF BIRTH     =February 16, 1915\n| PLACE OF BIRTH    =[[Osceola, Arkansas]], United States\n| DATE OF DEATH     =September 23, 1972\n| PLACE OF DEATH    =[[Detroit]], [[Michigan]], United States\n}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Frazier, Calvin}}\n[[Category:1915 births]]\n[[Category:1972 deaths]]\n[[Category:American blues musicians]]\n[[Category:Songwriters from Arkansas]]\n[[Category:American male singers]]\n[[Category:American blues singers]]\n[[Category:American blues guitarists]]\n[[Category:Detroit blues musicians]]\n[[Category:Musicians from Arkansas]]\n[[Category:Cancer deaths in Michigan]]\n[[Category:People from Mississippi County, Arkansas]]"}]}}}}
