He is primarily known as one of the prominent musicians of the [[One Man Band]] musical genre. He has appeared on national television shows such as NBC's \"The Tonight Show with Jay Leno\" and performed in prestigious venues such as The Lincoln Center in New York City and The Fillmore West in San Francisco, California.

He has also appeared as himself in several films and documentaries.\n\n==Biography==\nBiram was born in [[Lockhart, Texas]], [[United States]], and raised in [[Prairie Lea, Texas|Prairie Lea]] and [[San Marcos, Texas|San Marcos]], Texas. He graduated from San Marcos High School in 1992 and then from Southwest Texas State University (now called [[Texas State University]]) in 1997 with a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree. Prior to becoming a [[one-man band]], he was a member of a [[Punk rock|punk band]] (The Thangs) and two [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]] bands (Scott Biram & the Salt Peter Boys and Bluegrass Drive-By).<ref>[http://www.straight.com/article-223387/oneman-electrical-band Straight.com]</ref>\n\nBiram first released five [[album]]s under his own [[record label]], KnuckleSandwich Records. His first album was ''This is Kingsbury?'', released in 2000. This was followed by a second release, ''Preachin' & Hollerin'' in 2002. In February 2003 he released his third album, ''Lo-fi Mojo'', recorded live on the radio in Austin, Texas. In April 2003, while recovering from a major head-on collision with a big-rig semi truck he recorded and released the  \"Rehabilitation Blues E.P.\" The recording was made at his parent's home while he was still bedridden from his crash. In 2004, he released ''The Dirty Old One Man Band''. Subsequently, it was re-released (with a few changes) in 2005 when Biram signed with [[Bloodshot Records]] from [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]]. After signing with Bloodshot, Biram released ''Graveyard Shift'' (2006), and ''Something's Wrong / Lost Forever'' (2009).

His fourth record on the Bloodshot label, ''Bad Ingredients'', was released on October 11, 2011. The Album reached #35 on the iTunes Rock Chart on the day of release.<ref>[http://www.austin360.com/music/out-with-a-bang-2009-austin-albums-packed-145902.html Austin360.com]</ref> A week after the release of ''Bad Ingredients'' he appeared on the cover of the Austin, TX weekly magazine, ''[[The Austin Chronicle]]''. He received the \"Best Blues Record\" award in the 2012 Independent Music Awards.\nOn November 29, 2013 (Black Friday/Record Store Day) he released a limited edition gospel 7\" vinyl single, \"When I Die,\" (with B-side \"John The Revelator\" featuring Jesse Vain). The downloadable version was also made available. His latest full length album,\"Nothin' But Blood\" was released on Bloodshot Records, February 4th, 2014 on both limited edition, blood-red vinyl, and compact disc. \n\nOn March 25, 2003, Biram was involved in a head-on collision with a big-rig semi truck, which resulted in both his vehicle and his body being crushed.  He survived the wreck and was flown to Brook Army Medical Center in San Antonio, Texas. He suffered from a broken femur, knee, foot, and arm, and severe internal injuries. Metal rods and pins were placed in all of the broken bones, and one and a half feet of his intestine had to be removed from his body.<ref>[http://archives.nodepression.com/2004/05/a-crash-course-in-perseverance/]</ref> One month later he was back on stage at Austin's Continental Club playing a show from a wheelchair with an I.V. still dangling from his arm.\n\nSince 1999, Biram has toured the United States, Canada, and Europe (performing approximately 200 dates a year). Between 2005 and 2014, he has toured Europe eighteen times, including France, Belgium, Holland, Switzerland, Germany, Austria, Italy, Spain, Slovenia, Croatia, Serbia, Ireland, Scotland, Wales, England, Norway, Sweden, and Finland. He has toured and/or shared the stage with bands such as [[Reverend Horton Heat]], [[Shooter Jennings]], [[G. Love & Special Sauce]], and [[Hank Williams III]].  Biram has also performed as support for hard rock bands, [[Clutch]], [[Social Distortion]], [[Weedeater]], and [[Pentagram]], and appeared at large music festivals such as [[South By Southwest]], [[Austin City Limits]], and [[Fun Fun Fun Fest]] with big names like [[Judas Priest]], [[Robert Plant]], [[Foo Fighters]], [[Black Keys]], [[John Fogerty]], [[Snoop Dog]], and [[Dinosaur Jr.]]. When Scott H. Biram took the stage at his 2004 SXSW festival showcase right after country singer, Kris Kristofferson he was quoted as growling \u201cThey said that was a hard act to follow\u2026.I\u2019m a hard act to follow motherf***ers!!\u201d\n\nAlthough Biram doesn't cite anyone, or thing as an influence for becoming a one man band besides \"a need to pay bills\" and \"a need to avoid the politics of being in a band,\" he has mentioned that he is proud to have shared the stage with other prominent one man bands such as the late [[Hasil Adkins]] and his friend [[Bob Log III]]. \n\nBiram's musical style covers a wide spectrum. \"I grew up on [[Doc Watson]], [[Lead Belly]] and [[Lightnin' Hopkins]],\" he revealed, \"and in college, I discovered more obscure people like [[Lil' Son Jackson]] and [[Mance Lipscomb]].\"<ref>[http://www.austinchronicle.com/gyrobase/Issue/story?oid=oid%3A203093 Austinchronicle.com]</ref> Biram mixes roots music, [[CB radio]]s and a punk rock attitude.<ref>[http://www.cmt.com/news/country-music/1614780/scott-h-biram-mixes-roots-music-cb-radios-and-punk-rock-attitude.jhtml CMT.com]</ref> \"I kind of pride myself on being able to release my emotions freely and not hold back at all,\" he says. \"So many people these days have timid little weak voices like they're scared to belt it out.\"<ref>[http://www.tucsonweekly.com/tucson/fierceness-of-exposure/Content?oid=1091006 Tucsonweekly.com]</ref>\n\nAlthough primarily known as a [[One Man Band]], other musicians have participated and appeared on multiple Biram releases. Austin, TX musicians, [[The Weary Boys]] appeared on songs featured on Biram's records, \"Preachin' and Hollerin'\" and \"The Dirty Old One Man Band\". Particularly the songs \"Truckdriver,\" \"Sweet Thing,\" and \"Ocean of Diamonds\". [[Ethan Shawe]] of Austin, TX based band, [[Chili Cold Blood]] contributed steel guitar on the song \"18 Wheeler Fever\" on Biram's 2006 release \"Graveyard Shift\".

He accepted his award and performed at The Lincoln Center in New York City on March 28, 2013.\n\nScott H. Biram's fans are commonly referred to as \"The First Church of The Ultimate Fanaticism\".  This title was inspired by a fanatical extremist church in the town of Fentress, TX near where Biram grew up. His father jokingly referred to it as \"The First Church of The Ultimate Fanaticism\" because of its reputation for playing rock records backwards and burning them. The original Scott H. Biram heavy metal song \"Church Babies\" was written while Scott Biram was the front man for his 90's punk band, The Thangs. The lyrics are about \"The First Church of The Ultimate Fanaticism.\"  Despite his seemingly sarcastic lyrics protesting organized religion in various songs, he is also known for recording and performing both original, and traditional, genuine gospel music. In many interviews he has mentioned that he is fascinated with the push and pull of spirituality on a person's life and what he calls \"The Human Condition.\"\n\nHe is popularly known for playing original trucker songs such as \"TruckDriver\",  \"Reefer Load\",  \"18 Wheeler Fever\", \"Hit The Road\", \"Open Road\",  and \"Draggin' Down The Line,\" among others.  He is also known for writing and singing songs about \"chickens,\" which he claims refers not just to poultry, but also to lovers, ex-lovers and \"loose women\" in general.  He also raises real chickens at his home in Austin, TX. \n\nScott H. Biram's long time fans will recognize his sense of original, casual, rural fashion. He is known for wearing mesh-back trucker hats, and proudly sporting velcro shoes on stage. \n\nThe song \"Blood, Sweat & Murder\" from ''The Dirty Old One Man Band'' album, was used in the [[television program]], ''[[Dog the Bounty Hunter]]'', in the episode titled \"A Helping Hand\" and also on an episode of NBC's [[My Name Is Earl]]. His song \"Hit The Road\" was also used on ''Dog The Bounty Hunter''. \"Lost Case Of Being Found,\" \"Still Drunk, Still Crazy, Still Blue,\" and \"No Way\" were used in season four of FX Cable Channel's ''[[Sons Of Anarchy]]''.  His song \"Wreck My Car\" was used in the film, ''[[The Darwin Awards]]'',<ref>[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYLq8PlNKQk YouTube.com]</ref> starring [[Winona Ryder]] and [[Joseph Fiennes]]. The Biram song, \"BBQ Commercial\" is used in a television commercial for [[Rudy's Country Store and Bar-B-Q]], a popular Texas, Oklahoma, New Mexico, and Colorado restaurant chain.  Biram has appeared in many [[documentary film]]s, including a part in [[J.D. Wilkes]] 2008 [[film]], ''Seven Signs: Music, Myth & the American South''.<ref>[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1337167/ IMDb.com]</ref> Biram appeared in the 2008 German film ''The Folk Singer: A Tale of Men, Music & America''.<ref>[http://www.slowboatfilms.com/filmindex1.php Slowboatfilms.com]</ref> He was also featured in the French documentary, ''One Trip Some Noise.''

He also appears in the film \"My Blue Star\", a biography about the late [[Hasil Adkins]], a prominent musician in the [[One Man Band]] genre. In 2013, Biram was the featured artist on an episode of the PBS television show \"The Sun Studio Sessions\".\n\nHard rock band, [[Nashville Pussy]] covered his song \"Raisin Hell Again\" on their 2005 album, ''Get Some!''<ref>[http://www.nashvillepussy.com/discography?id=35 Nashvillepussy.com]</ref> [[Hank Williams III]] covered Biram's song, \"Truckdriver\".
