Best known for his high-energy blues-rock albums and live performances in the late 1960s and '70s, Winter also produced three [[Grammy Award]]-winning albums for blues legend [[Muddy Waters]].  Since his time with Waters, Winter has recorded several Grammy-nominated blues albums and continues to tour extensively.  In 1988, he was inducted into the [[Blues Foundation]] Hall of Fame and in 2003, he was ranked 63rd in [[Rolling Stone (magazine)|''Rolling Stone'']] magazine's list of the \"[[Rolling Stone's 100 greatest guitarists of all time|100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time]]\".<ref>{{cite web | title=100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/100-greatest-guitarists-20111123/johnny-winter-20111122}}</ref>\n\n==Early career==\nJohnny Winter, along with his musician brother [[Edgar Winter]] (born 1946), were nurtured at an early age by their parents in musical pursuits.<ref name=\"Sullivan\">\n{{Cite book\n  | last = Sullivan\n  | first = Mary Lou\n  | authorlink = \n  | coauthors = \n  | title = Raisin' Cain: The Wild and Raucous Story of Johnny Winter\n  | publisher = Backbeat Books\n  | series = \n  | volume = \n  | edition = \n  | year = 2010\n  | location = \n  | pages = \n  | language = \n  | url = \n  | doi = \n  | id = \n  | isbn = 978-0-87930-973-2\n  | mr = \n  | zbl = \n  | jfm = }}\n</ref>  Both Johnny and his brother, who were born with [[albinism]], began performing at an early age.  When he was ten years old, Winter appeared on a local children's show, playing ukulele and singing [[Everly Brothers]] songs with his brother.\n\nHis recording career began at the age of fifteen, when his band Johnny and the Jammers released \"School Day Blues\" on a Houston record label.<ref name=\"Sullivan\"/>  During this same period, he was able to see performances by classic blues artists such as Muddy Waters, [[B.B. King]], and [[Bobby Bland]].  In the early days Winter would sometimes sit in with [[Roy Head]] and the Traits when they performed in the Beaumont, Texas area, and in 1967, Winter recorded a single with the Traits: \"[[Tramp (song)|Tramp]]\" backed with \"[[Parchman Farm (song)|Parchman Farm]]\" (Universal Records 30496). In 1968, he released his first album ''[[The Progressive Blues Experiment]]'', on Austin's Sonobeat Records.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vinylrecords.ch/winter/Singles/winter_disco_universal.htm |title=Universal - Discography Vinyl Singles |publisher=Vinylrecords.ch |date=2007-10-10 |accessdate=2010-07-08}}</ref>\n\n==Signing with Columbia Records==\n[[File:JohnnyWinter1969.jpg|thumb|180px|left|Johnny Winter, Santa Monica Civic Auditorium, 1969]]\nWinter caught his biggest break in December 1968, when [[Mike Bloomfield]], whom he met and jammed with in Chicago, invited him to sing and play a song during a Bloomfield and [[Al Kooper]] concert at the [[Fillmore East]] in New York. As it happened, representatives of [[Columbia Records]] (which had released the Top Ten Bloomfield/Kooper/[[Stephen Stills|Stills]] ''[[Super Session]]'' album) were at the concert. Winter played and sang B.B. King's \"It's My Own Fault\" to loud applause and, within a few days, was signed to reportedly what was then the largest advance in the history of the recording industry&mdash;$600,000.<ref name=\"Sullivan\"/>\n\nWinter's first Columbia album, ''[[Johnny Winter (album)|Johnny Winter]]'', was recorded and released in 1969.  It featured the same backing musicians with whom he had recorded ''The Progressive Blues Experiment'', bassist [[Tommy Shannon]] and drummer Uncle John Turner, plus Edgar Winter on keyboards and saxophone, and (for his \"Mean Mistreater\") blues legends [[Willie Dixon]] on upright bass and [[Big Walter Horton]] on harmonica. The album featured a few selections that became Winter signature songs, including his composition \"Dallas\" (an acoustic blues, on which Winter played a steel-bodied, [[resonator guitar]]), [[Sonny Boy Williamson I|John Lee \"Sonny Boy\" Williamson]]'s \"[[Good Morning Little School Girl]]\", and B.B. King's \"Be Careful With A Fool\".\n\nThe album's success coincided with [[Imperial Records]] picking up ''The Progressive Blues Experiment'' for wider release. The same year, the Winter trio toured and performed at several rock festivals, including [[Woodstock festival|Woodstock]]. With brother Edgar added as a full member of the group, Winter also recorded his second album, ''[[Second Winter]]'', in Nashville in 1969.  The two-record album, which only had three recorded sides (the fourth was blank), introduced a couple more staples of Winter's concerts, including [[Chuck Berry]]'s \"[[Johnny B. Goode]]\" and [[Bob Dylan]]'s \"[[Highway 61 Revisited]]\". Also at this time Johnny entered into an intimate, albeit short-lived affair with Janis Joplin which culminated in a concert at New York's Madison Square Garden where Johnny joined the then reigning Queen of R&R on stage to sing and perform.\n\n==Unofficial albums==\nContrary to [[urban legend]], Johnny Winter did not perform with [[Jimi Hendrix]] and [[Jim Morrison]] on the 1968 infamous Hendrix bootleg album ''[[Woke up this Morning and Found Myself Dead|Woke Up This Morning and found Myself Dead]]'' from New York City's [[The Scene (performance venue)|The Scene]] club.  According to Winter, \"...I never even met Jim Morrison!  There's a whole album of Jimi and Jim and I'm supposedly on the album but I don't think I am 'cause I never met Jim Morrison in my life!  I'm sure I never, never played with Jim Morrison at all!  I don't know how that [rumor] got started.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.djnoble.demon.co.uk/ints/JOHNNYW.INT.html |title=Johnny Winter On Jimi Hendrix |publisher=Djnoble.demon.co.uk |date=1970-01-28 |accessdate=2012-03-06}}</ref>\n\nBeginning in 1969, the first of numerous Johnny Winter albums was released which were cobbled together from approximately fifteen singles (about 30 \"sides\") he recorded before signing with Columbia in 1969.<ref name=\"Sullivan\"/>  Many were produced by Roy Ames, owner of Home Cooking Records/Clarity Music Publishing, who had briefly managed Winter.  According to an article from the ''[[Houston Press]]'',<ref name=\"Houston Press\">[https://hou.secure.newtimes.com/issues/2003-08-28/music/racket_print.html Houston Press article dated August 28, 2003]</ref> Winter left town for the express purpose of getting away from him. Ames died on August 14, 2003 of natural causes at age 66.  As Ames left no obvious heirs, the ownership rights of the Ames master recordings remains unclear. As Winter stated in an interview when the subject of Roy Ames came up, \"This guy has screwed so many people it makes me mad to even talk about him.\"<ref name=\"Houston Press\"/>\n\n==Johnny Winter And==<!--NOT a typo, the band was named JOHNNY WINTER AND-->\nIn 1970, when his brother Edgar released a solo album ''[[Entrance (album)|Entrance]]'' and formed [[Edgar Winter's White Trash]], an R&B/jazz-rock group, the original trio disbanded.  Johnny Winter then formed a new band with the remnants of [[The McCoys]]&mdash;guitarist [[Rick Derringer]], bassist [[Randy Jo Hobbs]], and drummer Randy Z (who was Derringer's brother, their family name being Zehringer). Originally to be called \"Johnny Winter and The McCoys\", the name was shortened to \"Johnny Winter And\", which was also the name of their [[Johnny Winter And|first album]].<ref name=\"Sullivan\"/>  The album included Derringer's \"[[Rock and Roll, Hoochie Koo]]\" and signaled a more rock-oriented direction for Winter.  When Johnny Winter And began to tour, Randy Z was replaced with drummer [[Bobby Caldwell (drummer)|Bobby Caldwell]].  Their mixture of the new rock songs with Winter's blues songs was captured on the live album ''[[Live Johnny Winter And]]''. It included a new performance \"It's My Own Fault\", the song which brought Winter to the attention of Columbia Records.\n\nWinter's momentum was throttled when he sank into [[heroin addiction]] during the Johnny Winter And days. After he sought treatment for and recovered from the addiction, Winter was courageously put in front of the music press by manager [[Steve Paul]] to discuss the addiction candidly.<ref name=\"Sullivan\"/> By 1973, he returned to the music scene with the release of ''[[Still Alive and Well]]'', a basic blend between blues and hard rock, whose title track was written by Rick Derringer. His comeback concert at Long Island, N.Y.'s Nassau Colliseum featured the \"And\" line-up minus Rick Derringer and Bobby Caldwell. Also performing on stage was Johnny's wife Susie. The follow-up album, ''John Dawson Winter III'' featured \"Sweet Papa John,\" a highly dubbed slow blues number written by Johnny, which also appeared in an extended version on the later issued \"Captured Live.\" ''[[Saints & Sinners (Johnny Winter album)|Saints & Sinners]]'', continued the same direction; this was followed by another concert set, the aforementioned ''[[Captured Live!]]'', which featured an extended performance of \"Highway 61 Revisited\". In 1975 Johnny returned to Bogalusa, Louisiana, to produce an album for Thunderhead, a Southern rock band which included Pat Rush and Bobby \"T\" Torello, who would later play with Winter.\n\n==Muddy Waters sessions==\nIn live performances, Winter often told the story about how, as a child, he dreamed of playing with the blues guitarist [[Muddy Waters]]. In 1977, after Waters' long-time label [[Chess Records]] went out of business, he got his chance.<ref name=\"Sullivan\"/>  Winter brought Waters into the studio to record ''[[Hard Again]]'' for [[Blue Sky Records]], a label set up by Winter's manager and distributed by Columbia. In addition to producing the album, Winter played guitar with Waters veteran [[James Cotton]] on harmonica.  Winter produced two more studio albums for Waters, ''[[I'm Ready (Muddy Waters album)|I'm Ready]]'' (with Big Walter Horton on harmonica) and ''[[King Bee (album)|King Bee]]'' and a best-selling live album ''[[Muddy \"Mississippi\" Waters \u2013 Live]]''. The partnership produced three [[Grammy Awards]] for Waters and an additional Grammy for Winter's own ''[[Nothin' But the Blues (Johnny Winter album)|Nothin' But the Blues]]'', with backing by members of Waters' band.  Waters told ''Deep Blues'' author [[Robert Palmer (writer)|Robert Palmer]] that Winter had done remarkable work in reproducing the sound and atmosphere of Waters's vintage [[Chess Records]] recordings of the 1950s. The albums gave Waters the highest profile and greatest financial successes of his life.\n\n==Later career==\n[[File:Johnny Winter at Woodstock Reunion 1979.jpg|left|thumb|Woodstock Reunion, [[Parr Meadows]], Ridge, New York, 1979]]\n\nAfter his time with Blue Sky Records, Winter began recording for several labels, including [[Alligator Records|Alligator]], [[Point Blank Records|Point Blank]], and [[Virgin Records|Virgin]], where he focused on blues-oriented material.<ref name=\"Sullivan\"/> In 2004, he received a [[Grammy Award]] nomination for his ''I\u2019m a Bluesman'' album.  Beginning in 2007, a series of live Winter albums titled the ''Live Bootleg Series'' and a live DVD have all entered the Top 10 ''[[Billboard charts|Billboard]]'' Blues chart. In 2009, ''[[The Woodstock Experience]]'' album was released, which includes eight songs that Winter performed at the 1969 festival. In 2011,  Johnny Winter released a new studio album titled ''Roots'' on [[Megaforce Records]].  It includes Winter's interpretation of eleven early blues and rock 'n' roll classics and features several guest artists ([[Vince Gill]], [[Sonny Landreth]], [[Susan Tedeschi]], Edgar Winter, [[Warren Haynes]], and [[Derek Trucks]]).\n\nWinter has continued to perform live, including at festivals throughout North America and Europe. He has headlined such prestigious events as the [[New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival]], [[Chicago Blues Festival]], the 2009 [[Sweden Rock Festival]], [[The Warren Haynes Christmas Jam]], and [[Rockpalast]]. He also performed with the [[Allman Brothers]] at the [[Beacon Theatre (New York City)|Beacon Theater]] in New York City on the 40th anniversary of their debut.  In 2007 and 2010, Winter performed at [[Eric Clapton]]\u2019s [[Crossroads Guitar Festival]]s.  Two guitar instructional DVDs have been produced by [[Cherry Lane Music]] and the [[Hal Leonard Corporation]].  The [[Gibson Guitar Company]] released the signature Johnny Winter [[Gibson Firebird|Firebird guitar]] in a ceremony in Nashville with [[Slash (musician)|Slash]] presenting.\n\n==Recognition==\nWinter produced three [[Grammy Award]]-winning albums by Muddy Waters, ''[[Hard Again]]'' (1977), ''[[I'm Ready (Muddy Waters album)|I'm Ready]]'' (1978), and ''[[Muddy \"Mississippi\" Waters \u2013 Live]]'' (1979). Several Winter albums were also nominated for Grammy Awards.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.johnnywinter.net/bluesman/ |title=Johnny Winter |publisher=Johnny Winter |date= |accessdate=2012-03-06}}</ref>  In 1980, Winter was on the cover of the first issue of ''[[Guitar World]]'' and in 1988, he was inducted into the Blues Foundation Hall of Fame. There was a character in the video game [[Heavy Rain]] named after Winter.\n\nIn 1996, musicians Johnny and [[Edgar Winter]] filed suit against [[DC Comics]] and the creators of the ''[[Jonah Hex]]: Riders of the Worm and Such'' limited series, claiming, amongst other things, [[defamation]]: two characters named the Autumn Brothers in the series strongly resemble the Winters.<ref name=newsarama>{{cite web |url=http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=2841 |title=The Winter Brothers vs. Jonah Hex Goes Supreme |publisher=[[Newsarama]] |date=January 25, 2003}}</ref> In 2003, the [[Supreme Court of California]] sided with DC.<ref>Dean, Michael.

According to one biographer, only about fifteen percent of Winter's commercially-available recordings are legitimate, leaving 85 percent that he had no control over.<ref name=\"Sullivan\"/>  Some of the releases were doctored with later overdubs by other musicians.  Royalties were not Winter's primary concern, \"I just don't want that bullshit out ... It's just bad music\".<ref name=\"Sullivan\"/>  The following lists Johnny Winter's official albums.\n\n<!--Do NOT add unauthorized/bootleg albums to this list-->\n\n===Studio albums===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Year\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Album information\n!colspan=\"1\"|Peak chart positions\n|-\n!width=\"35\"|<small>[[Billboard 200|U.S.]]</small>\n\n|-\n| 1968\n|'''''[[The Progressive Blues Experiment]]'''''\n*Released: 1968\n*Label: Sonobeat\n|align=\"center\"| 40\n\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"| 1969\n|'''''[[Johnny Winter (album)|Johnny Winter]]'''''\n*Released: 1969\n*Label: Columbia\n|align=\"center\"| 24\n\n|-\n\n| '''''[[Second Winter]]'''''\n*Released: 1969\n*Label: Columbia\n|align=\"center\"| 55\n\n|-\n| 1970\n|'''''[[Johnny Winter And]]'''''\n*Released: 1970\n*Label: Columbia\n|align=\"center\"| 154\n\n|-\n| 1973\n| '''''[[Still Alive and Well]]'''''\n*Released: 1973\n*Label: Columbia\n|align=\"center\"| 22\n\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"| 1974\n| '''''[[Saints & Sinners (Johnny Winter album)|Saints & Sinners]]'''''\n*Released: 1974\n*Label: Columbia\n|align=\"center\"|42\n\n|-\n\n| '''''[[John Dawson Winter III]]'''''\n*Released: December 1974\n*Label: Blue Sky\n|align=\"center\"|78\n\n|-\n|1977\n| '''''[[Nothin' but the Blues (Johnny Winter album)|Nothin' but the Blues]]'''''\n*Released: November 1977\n*Label: Blue Sky\n|align=\"center\"|146\n\n|-\n| 1978\n| '''''[[White, Hot and Blue]]'''''\n*Released: 1978\n*Label: Blue Sky\n|align=\"center\"|141\n\n|-\n| 1980\n| '''''[[Raisin' Cain (album)|Raisin' Cain]]'''''\n*Released: 1980\n*Label: Blue Sky\n|align=\"center\"|-\n\n|-\n| 1984\n| '''''[[Guitar Slinger (Johnny Winter album)|Guitar Slinger]]'''''\n*Released: 1984\n*Label: Alligator\n|align=\"center\"|183\n\n|-\n| 1985\n| '''''Serious Business'''''\n*Released: 1985\n*Label: Alligator\n|align=\"center\"|156\n\n|-\n|1986\n| '''''[[Third Degree]]'''''\n*Released: 1986\n*Label: Alligator\n|align=\"center\"|-\n\n|-\n|1988\n| '''''[[The Winter of '88]]'''''\n*Released: 1988\n*Label: MCA\n|align=\"center\"| -\n\n|-\n|1991\n| '''''Let Me In'''''\n*Released: 1991\n*Label: Point Blank\n|align=\"center\"| 108\n\n|-\n\n| 1992\n| '''''[[Hey, Where's Your Brother?]]'''''\n*Released: 1992\n*Label: Point Blank\n|align=\"center\"| -\n|-\n| 2004\n|'''''I'm a Bluesman'''''\n*Released: 2004\n*Label: Virgin\n|align=\"center\"| 40\n\n|-\n| 2011\n|'''''[[Roots (Johnny Winter album)|Roots]]'''''\n*Released: 2011\n*Label: Sonobeat\n|align=\"center\"| 163\n\n|-\n|}\n\n===Live albums===\n*''[[Live Johnny Winter And]]'' (Columbia 1971)\n*''[[Captured Live!]]'' (Blue Sky 1976)\n*''[[Together: Edgar Winter and Johnny Winter Live|Together]]'' with Edgar Winter (Blue Sky 1976)\n*''[[Live in NYC '97]]'' (Virgin 1998)\n*''Live Bootleg Series, Volumes 1&ndash;10'' (Friday 2007&ndash;13)\n*''[[The Woodstock Experience]]'' (Sony/Legacy 2009)\n*''Live at the Fillmore East 10/3/70'' (Collectors 2010)\n*''Rockpalast: Blues Rock Legends Vol. 3'' recorded in Essen April, 1979 (2011)\n\n===Compilation albums===\n*''The Johnny Winter Story'' aka ''Raised on Rock'' (Columbia 1980)\n*''Scorchin' Blues'' (Columbia 1992)\n*''A Rock N' Roll Collection'' (Columbia 1994)\n*''Anthology'' (Columbia 1995)\n*''Return of Johnny Guitar (The Best of Johnny Winter 1984&ndash;86)'' (Empire 1996)\n*''White Hot Blues'' (Sony 1997)\n*''Deluxe Edition'' (Alligator 2001)\n*''The Best of Johnny Winter'' (Sony 2002)\n*''[[The Johnny Winter Anthology]]'' (Shout 2009)\n*'' Bamfest 2007 (Sugar River 2008)\n*'' Essential Johnny Winter (Columbia 2013)\n*'' True To the Blues: The Johnny Winter Story (Legacy 2014)\n\n===As producer and guitarist===\n*''Thunderhead'' &ndash; Thunderhead (1975)\n*''[[Hard Again]]'' &ndash; [[Muddy Waters]] (1977)\n*''[[I'm Ready (Muddy Waters album)|I'm Ready]]'' &ndash; Muddy Waters (1978)\n*''[[Muddy \"Mississippi\" Waters \u2013 Live]]'' &ndash; Muddy Waters (1979)\n*''[[King Bee (album)|King Bee]]'' &ndash; Muddy Waters (1980)\n*''Whoopin''' &ndash; [[Sonny Terry]] (1984)\n*''Breakin' It Up, Breakin' It Down'' &ndash; Muddy Waters & [[James Cotton]] (2007)\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Johnny Winter}}\n*[http://www.johnnywinter.com/ JohnnyWinter.net - the official webpage]\n*[http://www.vinylrecords.ch/winter/ - The Johnny Winter Story, the oldest Johnny Winter web site, with biography, timelines and detailed discographies]\n\n<!--======================== {{No more links}} ============================\n    | PLEASE BE CAUTIOUS IN ADDING MORE LINKS TO THIS ARTICLE.
