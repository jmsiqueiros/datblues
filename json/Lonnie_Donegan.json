Barber had heard that Donegan was a good [[banjo]] player; in fact, Donegan had never played the banjo at this point, but he bought one and tried to bluff his way through the audition. More on personality than playing, he was brought into Barber's band.<ref name=\"AMG\" /> His stint with the band was interrupted when he was called up for [[National Service]] in 1949, but his military service in [[Vienna]] gave him contact with [[United States|American]] [[military personnel|troops]], and access to records as well as the opportunity to listen to the [[American Forces Network]] [[radio station]].<ref name=\"MTV\" />\n\nIn 1952 he formed his first group, the Tony Donegan Jazzband, which found some work around London. On one occasion they opened for the blues musician [[Lonnie Johnson (musician)|Lonnie Johnson]] at the [[Royal Festival Hall]].<ref name=\"AMG\" /> Donegan was a [[fan (person)|fan]] of Johnson, and took his first name as a tribute to him. The often told story goes that the host at the concert got the musicians' names confused, calling them \"Tony Johnson\" and \"Lonnie Donegan\", and Donegan was happy to keep the name.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/ilove/years/1960/music2.shtml |title=Cult - I Love Lonnie Donegan |publisher=BBC |date= |accessdate=27 November 2013}}</ref> In fact, Donegan is known to have used the name \"Lonnie\" at a concert at the Royal Albert Hall on 2 June 1952, whilst the Lonnie Johnson concert at the Royal Festival Hall took place on 28 June 1952.<ref>{{cite book|first=Pete|title=The Restless Generation|year=2007|isbn=978-0-9529540-7-1|pages=57\u201378}}</ref>\n\nIn 1953 [[cornet]]ist [[Ken Colyer]], enjoying hero status for having spent time in a [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]] jail (because of a visa problem), returned to England and, when invited to play with Chris Barber's band, became a moving figure within it. With the new name, Ken Colyer's Jazzmen, the group, with Donegan, made its initial public appearance on 11 April 1953 in [[Copenhagen]]. The following day, [[Chris Albertson]] recorded the group (as well as a Monty Sunshine Trio, with Donegan and Barber) for [[Storyville Records]]. These were Donegan's first commercially released recordings.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}\n\n== Skiffle ==\nWhile playing in [[Ken Colyer]]'s Jazzmen with [[Chris Barber]], Donegan [[singing|sang]] and played both [[guitar]] and [[banjo]] as part of their [[Dixieland]] jazz set. He also began playing with two other band members during the intervals, to provide what was called on their posters a \"skiffle\" break, a name suggested by Ken Colyer's brother, Bill, after recalling the [[Dan Burley]] Skiffle Group of the 1930s.<ref name=\"AMG\" /> In 1954 Colyer left, and the band became Chris Barber's Jazz Band.<ref name=MTV />\n\nWith a [[washboard]], a [[tea-chest bass]] and a cheap Spanish guitar, Donegan entertained audiences with folk and blues songs by [[musician|artists]] such as [[Lead Belly]] and [[Woody Guthrie]].<ref name=\"AMG\" /> This proved so popular that in July 1954 he recorded a fast-tempo version of Leadbelly's \"[[Rock Island Line (song)|Rock Island Line]]\", featuring a [[washboard]] but not a tea-chest bass, with \"[[John Henry (folklore)|John Henry]]\" on the [[A-side and B-side|B-side]].<ref name=\"AMG\" /> It was an enormous hit in 1956<ref>Cf. Price, 2010.</ref> (which also later inspired the creation of a full [[album]], ''An Englishman Sings American Folk Songs'', released in America on the [[Mercury Records|Mercury]] [[record label|label]] in the early 1960s), but ironically, because it was a band recording, Donegan made no money from this recording beyond his original session fee. It was the first debut record to go [[music recording sales certification|gold]] in the [[United Kingdom|UK]], and reached the Top Ten in the [[United States]].<ref name=\"AMG\" />  His next [[single (Music)|single]] for [[Decca Records|Decca]], \"Diggin' My Potatoes\", was recorded at a [[concert]] at the Royal Festival Hall on 30 October 1954.<ref name=\"AMG\" /> Decca dropped Donegan thereafter, but within a month he was at the [[Abbey Road Studios]] in London recording for [[EMI]]'s [[Columbia Records|Columbia]] label. He had left the Barber band by then, and by the spring of 1955, Donegan signed a [[recording contract]] with [[Pye Records|Pye]]. His next single \"Lost John\" reached #2 in the [[UK Singles Chart]].<ref name=\"AMG\" />\n\nHe travelled to the United States, where he appeared on television on both the ''[[Perry Como]] Show'' and the ''[[Paul Winchell]] Show''.<ref name=\"AMG\" /> Returning to the UK, Donegan recorded his debut [[album]], ''Lonnie Donegan Showcase'', in the summer of 1956, which featured songs by [[Lead Belly]] and [[Leroy Carr]], plus \"I'm a Ramblin' Man\" and \"[[Wabash Cannonball]]\". The LP was a hit, securing sales in the hundreds of thousands.<ref name=\"AMG\" /> The popular skiffle style encouraged amateurs to get started, and one of the many skiffle groups that followed was [[The Quarrymen]] formed in March 1957 by [[John Lennon]]. Donegan's \"[[Gamblin' Man]]\" / \"[[Puttin' On the Style]]\" single was number one on the UK chart in July 1957, when Lennon first met [[Paul McCartney]].<ref name=\"British Hit Singles & Albums\" />\n\nDonegan went on to make a series of popular records with successes including \"[[Cumberland Gap (folk song)|Cumberland Gap]]\" and particularly \"[[Does Your Chewing Gum Lose Its Flavour (On the Bedpost Overnight?)]]\", his biggest hit song in the U.S., released on [[Dot Records|Dot]].<ref name=\"AMG\" /> He turned to a [[music hall]] style with \"[[My Old Man's a Dustman]]\" which was not well received by skiffle fans, or in an attempted but ultimately unsuccessful American release by [[Atlantic Records|Atlantic]] in 1960, but it reached number one in the UK Singles Chart. Donegan's group had a flexible line-up, but was generally formed by [[Denny Wright]] or Les Bennetts (of Les Hobeaux and Days of Skiffle, led by singer Dave George), playing lead guitar and singing harmony vocals, Micky Ashman or Pete Huggett \u2013 later Steve Jones \u2013 on [[upright bass]], Nick Nichols \u2013 later Pete Appleby, Mark Goodwin, and Ken Rodway (now a born again Christian author and minister) on drums or percussion, and Donegan playing acoustic guitar or banjo and singing the lead.<ref name=\"AMG\" />\n\nHe continued to appear regularly in the UK charts until 1962, before succumbing to the arrival of [[The Beatles]] and [[beat music]].<ref name=\"AMG\" />\n\n== Later career ==\nDonegan recorded sporadically during the 1960s, including some sessions at [[Hickory Records]] in [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]], [[Tennessee]] with [[Charlie McCoy]], [[Floyd Cramer]] and [[The Jordanaires]]. After 1964, he was primarily occupied as a [[record producer]] for most of the decade at Pye Records. Among those he worked with during this period was [[Justin Hayward]].<ref name=\"AMG\" />\n\nDonegan was unfashionable and generally ignored through the late 1960s and 1970s (although his \"[[I'll Never Fall in Love Again (Lonnie Donegan song)|I'll Never Fall in Love Again]]\" was recorded by [[Tom Jones (singer)|Tom Jones]] (in 1967) and [[Elvis Presley]] among others), and he began to play on the American [[cabaret]] circuit. A notable departure from his normal style was an [[a cappella]] recording of \"[[The Party's Over (1956 song)|The Party's Over]]\". There was a reunion concert with the original Chris Barber band in [[Croydon]] in June 1975 \u2013 notable for a bomb scare, meaning that the recording had to be finished in the studio, though patrons were treated to an impromptu concert in the car park. {{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} The resultant release was entitled ''The Great Re-Union Album''.<ref name=\"AMG\" />\n\nHe suffered his first [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] in 1976 while in the [[United States]] and underwent [[quadruple bypass]] surgery. He returned to the public's attention in 1978, when he made a record of his early songs with such figures as [[Rory Gallagher]], [[Ringo Starr]], [[Elton John]] and [[Brian May]] called ''Putting on the Style''.<ref name=\"AMG\" /> A follow-up album featuring [[Albert Lee]] saw Donegan working in a less familiar [[Country music|country and western]] vein. By 1980, he was making regular concert appearances again, and another album with Barber followed. In 1983 Donegan toured with [[Billie Jo Spears]], and in 1984, he made his theatrical debut in a revival of the 1920 musical ''[[Mr. Cinders]]''. More concert tours followed, along with a move from [[Florida]] to [[Spain]]. In 1992 Donegan underwent further [[Coronary artery bypass surgery|bypass]] surgery following another heart attack.<ref name=\"AMG\" />\n\nIn 1994, the Chris Barber band celebrated 40 years, with a tour with both bands. [[Pat Halcox]] was still on trumpet (a position he retained until July 2008). The reunion concert and the tour were recorded on CD and DVD.\n\nDonegan experienced another late renaissance when in 2000 he appeared on [[Van Morrison]]'s album ''[[The Skiffle Sessions \u2013 Live in Belfast 1998]]'', a critically acclaimed album featuring Donegan sharing vocals with Van Morrison and also featuring Chris Barber, with a guest appearance by [[Dr. John]]. Donegan also played at the [[Glastonbury Festival]], and was awarded the [[Order of the British Empire|MBE]] in 2000.\n\nLonnie Donegan also appeared at Fairport Convention's annual music festival on 9 August 2001  <[[Fairport's Cropredy Convention appearances#2001]]>\n\nDonegan's final CD was ''This Yere de Story''\n\n== Family ==\nDonegan married three times. He had two daughters by his first wife, Maureen Tyler (divorced 1962), a son and a daughter by his second wife, Jill Westlake (divorced 1971), and three sons by his third wife, Sharon, whom he married in 1977. He was the second cousin three times removed of the [[Scottish people|Scottish]] [[Gaelic Football]]er [[Chris Pendergast]].\n\n== Death ==\nLonnie Donegan died in 2002, aged 71, after suffering a [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]] in [[Market Deeping]] mid-way through a UK tour and shortly before he was due to perform at a memorial concert for [[George Harrison]] with [[The Rolling Stones]]. He had suffered from cardiac problems since the 1970s and had several heart attacks in his last years.\n\n== Legacy ==\n[[Mark Knopfler]] released a tribute song to Donegan entitled \"Donegan's Gone\" on his 2004 album, ''[[Shangri-La (Mark Knopfler album)|Shangri-La]]'', and said that he was one of his greatest musical influences.<ref name=obit /> Donegan's music formed the basis for a [[musical theatre|musical]] starring his two sons. ''Lonnie D \u2013 The Musical'' took its name from the [[Chas & Dave]] tribute song which started the show. Subsequently, [http://www.peterdonegan.com/ Peter Donegan] formed a new band that performed his father's material and has since linked up with his father's band from the last 30 years with newcomer Eddie Masters on bass. They released an album together in 2009 entitled \"Here We Go Again\". Donegan's eldest son, Anthony, also formed his own band, under the name Lonnie Donegan Jnr.\n\nOn his album ''[[A Beach Full of Shells]]'', [[Al Stewart]] paid tribute to Donegan in the song \"Katherine of Oregon\". Additionally, in the song \"Class of '58\", he describes a seminal British entertainer who is either Donegan or a composite including him.\n\n[[Peter Sellers]] recorded a track ''Puttin' on the Smile'' featuring an musician \"Lenny Goonagain\", who travels to the \"[[Deep South]]\" of [[Brighton]] and who finds an \"obscure folk song hidden at the top of the American hit parade\", re-records it, and reaches number one in the UK.\n\n=== Quotations ===\n\n{{cquote|I'm trying to sing acceptable folk music.
