Two of the founding members, drummer [[Brian Downey (drummer)|Brian Downey]] and bass guitarist/vocalist [[Phil Lynott]], met while still in school. Lynott assumed the role of [[frontman]] and led them throughout their recording career of twelve studio albums. Thin Lizzy are best known for their songs \"[[Whiskey in the Jar]]\", \"[[Jailbreak (Thin Lizzy song)|Jailbreak]]\" and \"[[The Boys Are Back in Town]]\", all major international hits still played regularly on hard rock and [[classic rock]] radio stations. After Lynott's death in 1986, various incarnations of the band have emerged over the years based initially around guitarists [[Scott Gorham]] and [[John Sykes]], though Sykes left the band in 2009. Gorham later continued with a new line-up including Downey.\n\nLynott, Thin Lizzy's ''de facto'' leader, was composer or co-composer of almost all of the band's songs, and the first black Irishman to achieve commercial success in the field of rock music. Thin Lizzy boasted some of the most critically acclaimed guitarists throughout their history, with Downey and Lynott as the [[rhythm section]], on the drums and bass guitar. As well as being multiracial, the band drew their members not only from both sides of the [[Irish border]] but also from both the Catholic and Protestant communities during [[The Troubles]]. Their music reflects a wide range of influences, including [[blues]], [[soul music]], [[psychedelic rock]], and traditional [[Irish folk music]], but is generally classified as hard rock or sometimes [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]]. ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine describes the band as distinctly hard rock, \"far apart from the braying mid-70s metal pack\".<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20071223002851/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/thinlizzy/biography Thin Lizzy]. ''Rolling Stone''.</ref>\n\n[[Allmusic]] critic John Dougan has written that \"As the band's creative force, Lynott was a more insightful and intelligent writer than many of his ilk, preferring slice-of-life working-class dramas of love and hate influenced by [[Bob Dylan]], [[Van Morrison]], [[Bruce Springsteen]], and virtually all of the [[Irish Literature|Irish literary tradition]].\"<ref>[{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p5633/biography|pure_url=yes}} Thin Lizzy: Biography]. ''AllMusic''</ref> Van Morrison, [[Jeff Beck]] and [[Jimi Hendrix]] were major influences during the early days of the band, and later influences included the pioneering twin lead guitars found in [[Wishbone Ash]] and American artists [[Little Feat]] and [[Bob Seger]].\n\nIn 2012, Gorham and Downey decided against recording new material as Thin Lizzy so a new band, [[Black Star Riders]], was formed to tour and produce new releases such as the ''[[All Hell Breaks Loose (Black Star Riders album)|All Hell Breaks Loose]]'' album. Thin Lizzy plan to reunite for occasional concerts.<ref name=\"noise11.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.noise11.com/news/exclusive-thin-lizzy-to-end-black-star-riders-to-begin-20121221 |title=Thin Lizzy to End, Black Star Riders to Begin |date=20 December 2012 |publisher=noise11.com}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n\n===Early years (1969\u201374)===\nThin Lizzy were founded one night in late December 1969 in [[Dublin]], Ireland, when [[Belfast]] guitarist [[Eric Bell]] met up with organist [[Eric Wrixon]] in a pub and found that they shared an ambition to form a group. Both musicians had previously played with [[Them (band)|Them]], fronted by [[Van Morrison]].<ref name=\"byrne\">Alan Byrne, \"Thin Lizzy: Soldiers of Fortune\", Firefly, 2004</ref> The same night, they went to see the band Orphanage, which featured vocalist [[Phil Lynott]] and drummer [[Brian Downey (drummer)|Brian Downey]]. Bell and Wrixon introduced themselves after the gig and suggested the four of them form a band together. Lynott and Downey were aware of Bell's good musical reputation,<ref name=\"putterford\">Mark Putterford, \"Philip Lynott: The Rocker\", Castle, 1994</ref> and agreed with the condition that Lynott play bass guitar as well as sing, and that they perform some of his own compositions.<ref name=\"byrne\" />\n\nIn July 1970, Thin Lizzy released a single, \"The Farmer\"/\"I Need You\", on [[EMI]] with the B-side written by John D'ardis, who owned Trend Studios where the single was recorded. The single sold just 283 copies and is now a collectors' item.<ref name=\"byrne\" /> Wrixon left the band before the single's release, meaning there was a greater share of income for the three remaining members.<ref name=\"putterford\" /> He moved to mainland Europe before returning to Belfast, rejoining his old band, Them.<ref name=\"bailie\">Stuart Bailie, \"The Ballad of the Thin Man\", Boxtree, 1996.</ref> By the end of the year, Thin Lizzy were signed to [[Decca Records]] and they travelled to London in January 1971 to record their debut album, ''[[Thin Lizzy (album)|Thin Lizzy]]''. The album sold moderately well but did not chart in the UK despite airplay and support from influential DJs [[John Peel]] and [[Kid Jensen]].<ref name=\"byrne\" />\n\nAround March 1971, the band permanently relocated to London, before the release of the unsuccessful \"New Day\" [[Extended play|EP]] in August.<ref name=\"bailie\" /> Despite poor sales, Decca agreed to finance the band's second album ''[[Shades of a Blue Orphanage]]'', released in March 1972. Like the previous LP, the songs were filled with Lynott's personal anecdotes and references to his life in Dublin and the people he knew there. Musically the style was [[Celtic rock|Celtic]], with little warning of the hard rock direction that the band were to take in the future.<ref name=\"byrne\" /> Again, the album did not chart in the UK.\n\nIn mid-1972, Thin Lizzy were asked to record an album of [[Deep Purple]] covers, which was released under the title ''[[Funky Junction]] Play a Tribute to Deep Purple''. No mention was made of Thin Lizzy on the record. Vocals and keyboards were handled by members of another band, Elmer Fudd, and a few instrumental tracks composed by the band were also included on the album.<ref name=\"putterford\" /> The album was released in January 1973.\n\n====\"Whiskey in the Jar\"====\n[[File:Thin Lizzy - TopPop 1974 1.png|thumb|Thin Lizzy in early 1974. Left to right: [[Brian Downey (drummer)|Brian Downey]], [[Phil Lynott]], [[Gary Moore]].]]  In late 1972, the band embarked upon a high-profile tour of the UK with [[Slade]], who were enjoying a string of hit singles at the time, and [[Suzi Quatro]]. Around the same time, Decca decided to release Thin Lizzy's version of a traditional [[Irish ballad]], \"[[Whiskey in the Jar]]\", as a single. The band was angry at the release, feeling that the song did not represent their sound or their image,<ref name=\"bailie\" /> but the single topped the Irish chart, and reached no. 6 in the UK in February 1973, resulting in an appearance on ''[[Top of the Pops]]''. It also charted in many countries across Europe. However, the follow-up single, \"Randolph's Tango\", was a return to Lynott's more obscure work, and it did not chart outside Ireland.<ref name=\"brooks\">Ken Brooks, \"Phil Lynott & Thin Lizzy: Rockin' Vagabond\", Agenda, 2000</ref>\n\nThe band's next album, ''[[Vagabonds of the Western World]]'', was released in September 1973 to positive reviews, but again failed to chart.<ref name=\"brooks\" /> The accompanying single \"[[The Rocker]]\" also found little success outside Ireland, and the momentum gained from their hit single was lost.<ref name=\"putterford\" />\n\nEric Bell suddenly left the band on New Year's Eve 1973 after a gig at [[Queen's University Belfast]], due to increasing ill-health and disillusionment with the music industry,<ref name=\"putterford\" /> and young ex-[[Skid Row (Irish band)|Skid Row]] guitarist [[Gary Moore]] was recruited to help finish the tour. Moore stayed until April 1974, but the band recorded three songs with him in that time, including the version of \"[[Still in Love with You (Thin Lizzy song)|Still in Love with You]]\" that was included on the fourth album ''[[Nightlife (Thin Lizzy album)|Nightlife]]''.\n\nWith the departure of Moore, Lynott decided to expand the line-up with two guitarists, and recruited two temporary members to complete a tour of Germany in May 1974. These were ex-[[Atomic Rooster]] and [[Hard Stuff]] guitarist [[John Du Cann|John Cann]], and [[Berlin]]er [[Andy Gee]], who had played with [[Peter Bardens]] and [[Steve Ellis (musician)|Ellis]]. Neither were considered as permanent members, as Lynott and Cann did not get on well personally,<ref name=\"putterford\" /> and Gee was under contract to another record label. The tour was ended early, and with Thin Lizzy's contract with Decca coming to an end, a disillusioned Downey quit the band and had to be begged to return.<ref name=\"bailie\" />\n\nAuditions were held for new members, and Lynott and Downey eventually settled on Glaswegian guitarist [[Brian Robertson]] who was only 17 years old at the time, and Californian [[Scott Gorham]]. The new line-up gelled quickly, dropped most of the old songs when they played live,<ref name=\"bailie\" /> and secured a new record deal with [[Phonogram Records|Phonogram]], but the resulting album ''Nightlife'' was a disappointment for the band due to its soft production and underdeveloped style.<ref name=\"byrne\" /> Robertson described [[Ron Nevison]]'s production as \"pretty naff\" and Gorham said the record was \"ridiculously tame\".<ref name=\"putterford\" /> Like the previous three albums, it failed to chart.\n\n===\"The Boys Are Back in Town\" (1975\u201377)===\n[[File:Phil-Lynott Thin Lizzy.jpg|thumb|220px|right|L to R: [[Brian Robertson]], [[Phil Lynott]], [[Scott Gorham]] performing during the Bad Reputation Tour, 24 November 1977]]\n\nIn early 1975, Thin Lizzy toured the USA for the first time, in support of [[Bob Seger]] and [[Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive]]. When BTO toured Europe later in the year to support their hit single \"[[You Ain't Seen Nothing Yet]]\", Thin Lizzy again accompanied them on what was a very high-profile tour.<ref name=\"putterford\" /> They then recorded the ''[[Fighting (Thin Lizzy album)|Fighting]]'' album, which became the first Thin Lizzy album to chart in the UK, reaching no. 60, although the singles still did not chart. It showed the first real evidence of the twin guitar sound that would lead the band towards their greatest successes, particularly with the dual harmonies of \"Wild One\" and both guitarists' soloing on \"Suicide\".<ref name=\"byrne\" />\n\nAfter a successful multi-band tour in support of [[Status Quo (band)|Status Quo]], the band recorded the album ''[[Jailbreak (album)|Jailbreak]]'', which proved to be their breakthrough record. Released on 26 March 1976, it featured the worldwide hit \"[[The Boys Are Back in Town]]\" which reached no. 8 in the UK, and no. 12 in the US,<ref name=\"stone\">{{cite web|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/6596344/the_boys_are_back_in_town |title=The Boys Are Back in Town |work=Rolling Stone |date=20 June 2008 |accessdate=2011-07-17 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080620041006/http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/6596344/the_boys_are_back_in_town |archivedate=20 June 2008}}</ref> their first charting record in that country. The twin guitar sound had been fully developed by this time and was in evidence throughout the album, particularly on the hit single, and other tracks such as \"Emerald\" and \"Warriors\". The album also charted well on both sides of the Atlantic, and the follow-up single, \"[[Jailbreak (Thin Lizzy song)|Jailbreak]]\", also performed well. Thin Lizzy toured the US in support of various bands such as [[Aerosmith]], [[Rush (band)|Rush]] and [[REO Speedwagon]], and they planned to tour there again in June 1976, this time with [[Rainbow (English band)|Rainbow]]. However, Lynott fell ill with [[hepatitis]] and the tour was cancelled, which set them back a few months.<ref name=\"byrne\" />\n\nWhile Lynott was ill, he wrote most of the following album, ''[[Johnny the Fox]]''. The album was recorded in August 1976 and the sessions began to reveal tensions between Lynott and Robertson; for example, there was disagreement over the composition credits of the hit single \"Don't Believe a Word\".<ref name=\"putterford\" /> Lynott was still drawing on [[Celtic mythology]] and his own personal experiences for lyric ideas, which dominated ''Johnny the Fox'' and the other albums of Thin Lizzy's successful mid-1970s period.<ref name=\"byrne\" /> The tour to support the album was very successful and there were further high-profile TV appearances, such as the ''[[Rod Stewart]] [[BBC]] TV Special''.<ref name=\"bailie\" />\n\nA further tour of the USA was planned for December 1976, but it had to be cancelled when, on 23 November, Brian Robertson suffered a hand injury when trying to protect fellow Glaswegian, singer and friend [[Frankie Miller]] in a fracas at the [[Speakeasy Club]] in London. Miller had been jamming onstage with the [[reggae]] band [[Gonzalez (band)|Gonzalez]], but had been drunk, offending Gonzalez guitarist Gordon Hunte. Hunte attacked Miller with a bottle in the dressing room, and Robertson intervened, suffering artery and nerve damage to his hand.<ref name=\"putterford\" /><ref name=\"bailie\" /> Robertson subsequently broke Hunte's leg, broke the collarbone of another man, and headbutted another, before being hit on the head with a bottle, rendering him unconscious.<ref name=\"putterford\" />\n\nRobertson maintains that, contrary to reports at the time, he was not drunk and had only gone to the venue for a meal.<ref name=\"byrne\" /><ref name=\"putterford\" /> Lynott was angry and replaced Robertson with Gary Moore for another tour of the States in January\u2013March 1977, this time supporting [[Queen (band)|Queen]]. The tour was a success and Lynott asked Moore to stay on, but he returned to his previous band, [[Colosseum II]]. Robertson had not been sacked but was unsure of his position and made plans to start another band with [[Jimmy Bain]] of Rainbow.<ref name=\"putterford\" /> Before the American tour, Lynott had also invited Irish guitarist Jimi Slevin to \"try out a few things\" with Thin Lizzy, prompting speculation that the ex-[[Skid Row (Irish band)|Skid Row]] member could replace Robertson.<ref>''Starlight'' Magazine, 16 December 1976</ref>\n\nThin Lizzy flew to Canada in May 1977 as a trio to record ''[[Bad Reputation (Thin Lizzy album)|Bad Reputation]]'', with Gorham handling all the guitar parts. A month into the sessions Robertson joined them, in his own words, \"as a session player\"<ref name=\"byrne\" /> and in Lynott's words, \"as a guest\".<ref name=\"bailie\" /> Robertson added lead guitar tracks to three songs as well as rhythm guitar and keyboards, and was officially reinstated in July. The album was released in September and sold well, reaching no. 4 in the UK, after a successful single, \"Dancing in the Moonlight (It's Caught Me in Its Spotlight)\". Also in 1977, Thin Lizzy headlined the Reading Festival.\n\n===The return of Gary Moore (1978\u201379)===\n[[File:Thin lizzy 08081977 04 800.jpg|thumb|275px|right|Thin Lizzy 8 August 1977; Robertson, Lynott, Gorham, Downey]]\nIn 1978, Lizzy released their first live album ''[[Live and Dangerous]]''. There is some disagreement over just how much of the album is actually recorded live \u2013 producer [[Tony Visconti]] claimed that the only parts that were not [[overdub]]bed were the drums and the audience. However Brian Robertson has disputed this, saying that he had refused Lynott's request to re-record a guitar solo, and that the only overdubs were backing vocals and some guitar parts by Gorham. He added, \"It's just not true. The only reason we said that it was recorded all over was obviously for tax reasons... so everything that Visconti claims is bollocks.\"<ref name=\"byrne\" /> Gorham concurs, stating that he attempted to re-record a solo but could not recreate the live sound, adding, \"I re-did ''one'' rhythm track and a few backing vocals. But that's it.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.gibson.com/News-Lifestyle/Features/en-us/thin-lizzy-scott-gorham-interview-1213-2012.aspx |title=Thin Lizzy's Scott Gorham talks Les Pauls, tour and memoir |date=13 December 2012 |accessdate=13 March 2014 |publisher=Gibson official website}}</ref> The album was a huge success, reaching no. 2 in the UK, and was ranked as the best live album of all time by [[Classic Rock (magazine)|Classic Rock Magazine]] in 2004.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/music/3526300.stm |title=Thin Lizzy top live album poll |publisher=BBC  |date=1 August 2004 |accessdate=17 April 2011}}</ref> But this success was overshadowed by the permanent departure of Robertson some time after a gig in [[Ibiza]] on 6 July 1978, the disagreements with Lynott having developed to an impossible level.<ref name=\"bailie\" /> Robertson soon teamed up with Jimmy Bain to front their new band, [[Wild Horses (British band)|Wild Horses]].\n\nLynott replaced Robertson with Gary Moore again, and around this time the band loosely joined forces with [[Steve Jones (musician)|Steve Jones]] and [[Paul Cook]] of the [[Sex Pistols]], and also [[Chris Spedding]] and Jimmy Bain, to form The Greedy Bastards, who played a small number of gigs playing a varied selection of songs. In this way Lynott was able to align his band with the [[punk rock|punk]] movement and avoid being tagged as a 'dinosaur' as many other 1970s rock bands had been.<ref name=\"putterford\" />\n\nIn August the band began another tour of the USA, followed by a trip to Australia and New Zealand. Brian Downey did not accompany them, having contracted pneumonia and preferring to spend some time in Ireland. He was replaced for the tour by American drummer [[Mark Nauseef]].<ref name=\"bailie\" /> On their return, Downey rejoined the band and at the beginning of 1979 they recorded ''[[Black Rose: A Rock Legend]]'' in Paris. The sessions were marked by the increasing drug habits of Lynott and Gorham, and the general presence of drugs around the band.<ref name=\"putterford\" /> This also showed in the subject matter on the album, in songs such as \"Got to Give It Up\". Celtic influences remained, however, particularly in the album closer \"R\u00f3is\u00edn Dubh\", a seven-minute medley of traditional Irish songs given a twin guitar rock veneer. Two singles, \"[[Waiting for an Alibi]]\" and \"[[Do Anything You Want To]]\", were successful, and the album reached no. 2 in the UK.<ref name=\"UK\">{{cite web| url=http://www.chartstats.com/artistinfo.php?id=287 |title=Chart Stats \u2013 Thin Lizzy |publisher=Chart Stats |accessdate=25 June 2008|archiveurl=http://archive.is/xvc5|archivedate=25 May 2012}}</ref> A third, moderately successful single, \"[[Sarah (Thin Lizzy song)|Sarah]]\" was Lynott's ode to his new-born daughter.<ref name=\"brooks\" />\n\nHowever, on 4 July 1979, Gary Moore abruptly left Thin Lizzy in the middle of another tour of the USA. Years later, Moore said he had no regrets about walking out, \"but maybe it was wrong the way I did it. I could've done it differently, I suppose. But I just had to leave.\"<ref name=\"putterford\" /> He subsequently pursued his solo career, releasing several successful albums. He had collaborated with Lynott and Downey on his 1978 album ''[[Back on the Streets (Gary Moore album)|Back on the Streets]]'' and the hit single \"[[Parisienne Walkways (song)|Parisienne Walkways]]\" before leaving Thin Lizzy, and in 1985 he and Lynott teamed up again on the UK no. 5 hit single \"[[Out in the Fields (song)|Out in the Fields]]\". Gary Moore died of a heart attack in [[Estepona]], Spain on 6 February 2011, aged 58.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2011/0206/breaking25.html |title=Former Thin Lizzy guitarist Moore dies |date=6 February 2011 |work=The Irish Times}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-12391305 |title=Guitarist Gary Moore 'died of heart attack' |date=8 February 2011 |publisher=BBC }}</ref>\n\nAfter Moore's departure, Thin Lizzy continued the tour for a few nights as a trio before Lynott brought in [[Midge Ure]] to replace him on a temporary basis. Ure had prior plans to join [[Ultravox]], but had co-written a song, \"Get Out of Here\", with Lynott on ''Black Rose: A Rock Legend'', and agreed to help Thin Lizzy complete their touring commitments.<ref name=\"byrne\" /> He also contributed guitar parts for ''[[The Continuing Saga of the Ageing Orphans]]'', a compilation album of remixed and overdubbed versions of Eric Bell-era tracks. On their return to the UK, the band were to headline the Reading Festival for the second time on 25 August 1979, but had to cancel due to the disruption within the line-up.<ref name=\"byrne\" />\n\nBefore a tour of Japan beginning in September, Lynott decided to bring in another guitarist, [[Dave Flett]], who had played with [[Manfred Mann's Earth Band]], to enable Ure to switch to playing keyboards where necessary. The tour was completed successfully, but the line-up now contained two temporary members, and Lynott was spending a lot of time on projects outside Thin Lizzy, including composing and producing material for other bands, as well as putting together his first solo album, ''[[Solo in Soho]]''.<ref name=\"putterford\" /> Lynott also reactivated The Greedy Bastards, who released a one-off Christmas single, \"A Merry Jingle\", in December 1979 as simply The Greedies. With the group now composed of Lynott, Gorham and Downey with Sex Pistols Jones and Cook, the single reached no. 28 in the UK.<ref name=\"brooks\" />\n\n===Later years and break-up (1980\u201383)===\n[[File:Front Thin Lizzy.jpg|thumb|275px|right|Thin Lizzy in concert, 1981]]\nWhile Lynott searched for a permanent guitarist, he and the other members of Thin Lizzy, past and present, worked on ''Solo in Soho'' which was released in April 1980, and the next Thin Lizzy album, ''[[Chinatown (Thin Lizzy album)|Chinatown]]''. Lynott got married on 14 February, and his wife gave birth to a second daughter in July.<ref name=\"lynott\">Philomena Lynott, \"My Boy: The Philip Lynott Story\", Virgin, 1995.</ref> Dave Flett had hoped to be made a permanent member of Thin Lizzy but Lynott chose [[Snowy White]], who had played with [[Pink Floyd]] and [[Peter Green (musician)|Peter Green]].<ref name=\"byrne\" /> Midge Ure was still acting as a temporary keyboard player at gigs during early 1980, but was replaced by [[Darren Wharton]] in April, shortly after White joined the band. Wharton was only 17 at the time and was initially hired on a temporary basis.<ref name=\"byrne\" /> This new line-up completed the ''Chinatown'' album between short tours, and two singles were released from it. The first, \"Chinatown\", reached no. 21 in the UK, but the second, \"[[Killer on the Loose]]\", reached the top 10 amid much adverse publicity due to the ongoing activities of serial killer [[Peter Sutcliffe]], known as \"The Yorkshire Ripper\".<ref name=\"bailie\" />\n\n''Chinatown'' was finally released in October 1980, and reached no. 7 in the UK, but by this time Thin Lizzy albums were not even reaching the top 100 in the USA. After a successful tour of Japan and Australia, the band undertook what was to be their final tour of the USA in late 1980.<ref name=\"byrne\" />\nAt the beginning of 1981, Lynott began work on his second solo album, using Thin Lizzy members among a large group of backing musicians. Around the same time, the band were recording material for the next Thin Lizzy album, and as before, the sessions seemed to merge to the extent that musicians were not always sure which album they were working on. Producer for the Thin Lizzy sessions, [[Chris Tsangarides]], stated, \"The feeling of confusion was in the air in that sometimes nobody knew if they were working on a Phil solo record or a Lizzy album.\"<ref name=\"byrne\" /> Snowy White had previously felt that, as a member of Thin Lizzy, he should have been paid as a session player to appear on Lynott's solo recordings.<ref name=\"putterford\" />\n\nIn April 1981, the band's first 'greatest hits' album was released, and ''[[The Adventures of Thin Lizzy]]'' reached no. 6 in the UK, although a stand-alone single, \"Trouble Boys\", only reached no. 53, the band's worst chart placing since 1975.<ref name=\"bailie\" /> According to White<ref name=\"byrne\" /> and Wharton,<ref name=\"putterford\" /> Lynott was the only person who wanted to release it, and nobody else liked the song. \"Trouble Boys\" had even been pencilled in as the title for the new album, but the single's chart failure resulted in the song being dropped from the album and the title changed to ''[[Renegade (Thin Lizzy album)|Renegade]]''.<ref name=\"byrne\" /> One highlight for the band at this time was headlining the first-ever [[Slane Concert|Slane Castle]] concert on 16 August, with support from [[Kirsty McColl]], [[Hazel O'Connor]] and [[U2]].<ref name=\"byrne\" />\n\nLynott's second solo album, ''[[The Philip Lynott Album]]'', was delayed until 1982 while ''Renegade'' was completed and released in November 1981. ''Renegade'' was not successful, only reaching no. 38 in the UK and no. 157 in the US.<ref name=\"byrne\" /> A single, \"[[Hollywood (Down on Your Luck)]]\", also flopped,<ref name=\"brooks\" /> although it did reach no. 24 on the US [[Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks|Mainstream Rock]] chart.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://allmusic.com/artist/thin-lizzy-p5633/charts-awards/billboard-singles |title=Thin Lizzy Billboard statistics |accessdate=4 December 2011 |work=AllMusic}}</ref> Despite only two songs from the album being written solely by Lynott, and other members of the band contributing more to the compositions, both Gorham and Wharton have since stated their dissatisfaction with some of the songs, such as \"Angel of Death\", \"Fats\" and \"Mexican Blood\".<ref name=\"putterford\" /> Wharton was omitted from the band photos on the back of the record sleeve, despite the fact that he was by this time a permanent member of the band. \"It hurt me a great deal\", he said.<ref name=\"putterford\" />\n\n====\"Thunder and Lightning\"====\n[[File:Thin Lizzy - Manchester Apollo - 1983 (2).jpg|thumb|275px|right|Thin Lizzy performing at the [[Manchester Apollo]], showing their famous dual guitars on each side]]\n\nThe beginning of 1982 was marred by both Downey and Gorham having to take breaks from the European tour to recover from personal problems. Downey was involved in a fight in a nightclub in Denmark in February,<ref name=\"byrne\" /> and Gorham was suffering from drug-induced exhaustion.<ref name=\"bailie\" /> Downey missed five concerts, and was replaced by [[Mark Nauseef]] again for three of them, and by Mike Mesbur of support band The Lookalikes for the other two.<ref name=\"Guide\">{{cite web|url=http://www.thinlizzyguide.com/tours/year/1982.htm |title=Thin Lizzy Tour 1982 |accessdate=4 June 2012 |publisher=Thin Lizzy Guide}}</ref> In March, Gorham collapsed and returned home; eight concerts were performed as a quartet and six others were postponed.<ref name=\"Guide\" />\n\nLater in the year, Lynott went on a solo tour and released his second solo album, which did not sell particularly well. Snowy White left the band in August 1982, having tired of the disorganised schedules and Lynott's drug problems, although by his own admission he was too restrained and quiet to fit in well with his more raucous bandmates.<ref>Interview with Snowy White, [[BBC Radio 1]], \"The Friday Rock Show\", 8 January 1986.</ref> White went on to achieve top ten chart success in the UK with his single \"[[Bird of Paradise (Snowy White song)|Bird of Paradise]]\" in 1983. Long-time co-manager Chris O'Donnell also left at this time, later stating, \"A once-brilliant band was turning to crap before my very eyes.\"<ref name=\"putterford\" />\n\nLynott wanted to find a replacement for White before starting to record the next album, which would turn out to be the band's last. By September 1982, he had settled on [[John Sykes]] who had been a member of [[Tygers of Pan Tang]], and he co-wrote the first single from the album, \"[[Cold Sweat (Thin Lizzy song)|Cold Sweat]]\", although the rest of the album had already been written. ''[[Thunder and Lightning (album)|Thunder and Lightning]]'' was released in March 1983, and was much more successful than its predecessor, reaching no. 4 in the UK.<ref name=\"brooks\" /> Sykes' presence had rejuvenated the band musically, the composing credits were evenly shared, and the style had grown much heavier, veering towards [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]].<ref name=\"byrne\" />\n\nThe tour to support the album was to be a farewell tour, although Lynott was not convinced that this would be the end of the band. Sykes wanted to continue, although Gorham had had enough.<ref name=\"putterford\" /> The tour was successful, and some concerts were recorded to compile a live album. Partway into the tour, many of Thin Lizzy's past guitarists were invited onstage to contribute to some of the songs they had originally recorded, the only exception being Snowy White. The album was released in October 1983 as ''[[Life (Thin Lizzy album)|Life]]'', which included an older performance of \"Renegade\" featuring White, and reached no. 29 in the UK.<ref name=\"brooks\" /> The tour continued while two more singles were released, the last of them, \"[[The Sun Goes Down (Thin Lizzy song)|The Sun Goes Down]]\", only reaching no. 52 in August. Lynott also undertook another solo tour, accompanied by Downey and Sykes, under the name of The Three Musketeers.<ref name=\"byrne\" />\n\nAfter a difficult leg of the tour in Japan, where some members of the band had difficulty obtaining heroin,<ref name=\"putterford\" /> Thin Lizzy played their final UK concert before their break-up at the [[Reading Festival]] on 28 August 1983, which was eventually released in 1992 as their ''[[BBC Radio One Live in Concert (Thin Lizzy album)|BBC Radio One Live in Concert]]'' album. The last concert came in [[Nuremberg]] on 4 September, at the [[Monsters of Rock]] festival, after which the band members went their separate ways.<ref name=\"brooks\" />\n\n===Post-Thin Lizzy projects and tributes (1985\u201396)===\nBefore the end of 1983, Phil Lynott formed a new band called [[Grand Slam (band)|Grand Slam]], but they were never able to secure a contract with a record company and split by the beginning of 1985.<ref name=\"bailie\" /> Sykes and Downey initially agreed to be a part of the band, but Sykes joined [[Whitesnake]] and Downey also changed his mind. Lynott began to focus more on his solo career and enjoyed a no. 5 hit single \"[[Out in the Fields (song)|Out in the Fields]]\" with Gary Moore in May 1985.<ref name=\"bailie\" /> The song, composed by Moore, was taken from his solo album ''[[Run for Cover (Gary Moore album)|Run for Cover]]'' featuring various contributions from Lynott. Lynott's solo efforts did not fare so well, and his last single, \"Nineteen\", only reached no. 76 in the UK.<ref name=\"black rose\">Adam C. Winstanley, \"Black Rose\" magazine, Issue 4, 1990.</ref>\n\nBefore his death, Lynott was planning a third solo album, and had spoken to Downey about a possible reformation of Thin Lizzy around March 1986, with Gorham and Sykes, and had booked studio time for January of that year.<ref>Interview with Brian Downey, [[BBC Radio 1]], \"The Friday Rock Show\", 8 January 1986.</ref> However, he died in hospital in [[Salisbury]], Wiltshire, on 4 January 1986, aged 36, having suffered from internal [[abscess]]es, [[pneumonia]] and [[sepsis|septicaemia]], brought on by his drug dependency, which led to multiple organ failure.<ref name=\"byrne\" /><ref name=\"putterford\" /><ref name=\"brooks\" />\n\nOn 17 May, Thin Lizzy reformed for the [[Self Aid]] concert, with a line-up of Gary Moore, Downey, Gorham, Wharton and [[Bob Daisley]] on bass. [[Bob Geldof]] and Moore handled most lead vocals, though various singers got onstage for \"[[Whiskey in the Jar]]\". A compilation album, ''Soldier of Fortune'', was released in 1987, and also that year, the \"Vibe for Philo\" tribute concert in Lynott's memory was organised by Dublin DJ and promoter Smiley Bolger, which continues on an annual basis on the anniversary of Lynott's death.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vibeforphilo.com |title=The Vibe for Philo |publisher=The Vibe for Philo |accessdate=3 April 2011}}</ref>\n[[File:Brian Robertson in 2011.jpg|thumb|left|220px|Brian Robertson performing at the 25th annual \"Vibe for Philo\" on 4 January 2011]]\nThe remaining members of Thin Lizzy did not work together until the recording of the single \"Dedication\" in October 1990, when a rough demo of Lynott's was worked into a finished song to commemorate the fifth anniversary of his death. The song dated from the Grand Slam days and had been originally written with guitarist [[Laurence Archer]].<ref name=\"byrne\" /><ref name=\"putterford\" /> Modern recording techniques were used to replace the guitar and drum tracks with new work by Downey and Gorham. Gary Moore had agreed to participate as well, but ultimately did not do so.<ref name=\"putterford\" /> The song charted in the UK at no. 35 during early 1991, and no. 2 in Ireland,<ref name=\"irishchart\">{{cite web|url=http://www.irishcharts.ie/search/placement?page=1 |title=Irish Charts \u2013 Thin Lizzy |accessdate=21 June 2011 |publisher=irishcharts.ie}}</ref> and featured on another greatest hits compilation album, ''[[Dedication: The Very Best of Thin Lizzy]]'', released in February of that year, which reached no. 8 in the UK album chart.<ref name=\"bailie\" />  However, a follow-up reissue of \"The Boys Are Back in Town\" only reached no. 63 in the UK,<ref name=\"UK\" /> although it peaked at no. 16 in Ireland.<ref name=\"irishchart\" />\n\nFollowing this, numerous small reunion projects began to appear. In 1991, a line-up featuring Robertson and Downey performed with [[Bobby Tench]] on lead vocals, ex-Grand Slam member Doish Nagle on guitar and Doug Brockie on bass. They toured Ireland briefly with a series of \"An Evening of Thin Lizzy\" concerts.<ref name=\"putterford\" /> In August 1994, Downey, Bell, Robertson and Wharton held a tribute concert in [[Wolverhampton]], together with tribute bands Limehouse Lizzy, Ain't Lizzy and Bad Habitz.<ref name=\"bailie\" /> Another version of Thin Lizzy was formed later that year by John Sykes (now also performing lead vocals) with Downey, Gorham and Wharton, and with bass parts played by [[Marco Mendoza]], who had played with Sykes in [[Blue Murder (band)|Blue Murder]] from 1991\u201393. The tour was advertised as a tribute to Phil Lynott.<ref name=\"byrne\" /> This line-up also played at the Vibe for Philo gig on 4 January 1996, with a number of other notable musicians including Eric Bell, Midge Ure, [[Henry Rollins]], [[Therapy?]] and [[Joe Elliott]] and [[Rick Savage]] from [[Def Leppard]].<ref name=\"bailie\" />\n\nIn 1994, a collection of Thin Lizzy tracks from the BBC Radio 1 [[The Peel Sessions (Thin Lizzy album)|Peel Sessions]] was released, and yet another compilation album was brought out in 1996, called ''[[Wild One: The Very Best Of Thin Lizzy]]''. This was successful, although strangely it did not feature the title track, \"Wild One\".\n\nOn 20 August 1996, [[Rude Awakening (band)|Rude Awakening]] bassist Robert Ryder held \"A Celebration of the Life of Philip Lynott\" at [[Avalon Hollywood|the Palace in Hollywood, California]] at the request of Lynott's mother, Philomena, to commemorate both Phil Lynott's birthday and the tenth year of his passing. Philomena Lynott, her partner Dennis Keeley, and Smiley Bolger (Ireland's Vibe For Philo promoter) were flown to Los Angeles by Ryder to make a personal appearance at the show. It featured concert performances by Rude Awakening, [[Billy Sheehan]], [[Rudy Sarzo]], [[John Norum]], [[Carmine Appice]], [[Phantom Blue]], [[Soma]], producer [[Roy Z]] and his band the Tribe of Gypsies, Mark Ferrari, Oslo, [[Bang Tango]], Stash, Iron Cross and Irish singer-songwriter Mark Dignam.\n\n===Thin Lizzy without Lynott (1996\u2013present)===\n[[File:Thin Lizzy (20).JPG||thumb|240px|The reformed version of Thin Lizzy at [[Gods of Metal]], 2007]]\nIn 1996 John Sykes decided to reactivate Thin Lizzy, presenting the band as a tribute to Phil Lynott's life and work.<ref name=\"sykes99\">{{cite web|url=http://www.melodicrock.com/interviews/johnsykes.html |title=Interview with John Sykes, July 1999 |publisher=Melodicrock.com |accessdate=3 April 2011}}</ref> He decided to take on the role of lead vocals himself in the absence of Lynott, and persuaded Scott Gorham, Brian Downey and Darren Wharton to return to the fold. To complete the line-up, Marco Mendoza continued in Lynott's role as bass player. They received criticism for using the Thin Lizzy name without Lynott being present,<ref name=\"byrne\" /> but the band only played hits from Thin Lizzy's back catalogue, and did not compose any new material.<ref name=\"sykes99\" />\n\nIn 1997, [[Tommy Aldridge]] filled in on drums when Brian Downey was unable to, and became a full member when Downey left shortly thereafter. This line-up remained stable through to 2000, when the group recorded a live album, ''[[One Night Only (Thin Lizzy album)|One Night Only]]''. The band went on to tour the US playing clubs in early 2001, but Wharton had already left the band by the time of the tour. From 2000 to 2003, Mendoza toured with [[Ted Nugent]], and with [[Whitesnake]] in 2004. Sykes released two solo albums in the gap in between 2002\u201303, while Gorham worked with his band [[21 Guns (band)|21 Guns]].\n\nWharton later stated that Thin Lizzy would have been better suited to playing fewer concerts, in bigger venues. He also felt that after the experience of fronting his own band [[Dare (band)|Dare]], it was not satisfying enough to play keyboards behind Gorham and Sykes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lordsofmetal.nl/showinterview.php?id=1194&lang=en |title=Interview with Darren Wharton |publisher=Lords of Metal |accessdate=17 April 2011}}</ref> Sykes said that all the previous Thin Lizzy members were welcome to play with Thin Lizzy at any time.<ref>{{cite web|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080410173028/http://www.johnsykes.com/AtomicInterview.htm |title=Interview with John Sykes c.2004|archivedate=10 April 2008|url=http://www.johnsykes.com/AtomicInterview.htm|work=Komodo Rock, hosted at johnsykes.com|accessdate=18 April 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn 2004, Thin Lizzy worked together again, with Sykes and Gorham bringing in ex-[[Angel (band)|Angel]] bassist [[Randy Gregg (musician)|Randy Gregg]], and drummer [[Michael Lee (musician)|Michael Lee]], who had played with [[Robert Plant]] and [[The Cult]] among others. They toured in North America in both the winter and then the summer as special guests of Deep Purple. This line-up proved temporary however, with Mendoza returning in 2005, and Aldridge returning in 2007. There were no plans for a new album though Thin Lizzy continued to tour. At the London [[Hammersmith Apollo]] concert of 13 December 2007, the line-up was Sykes, Gorham, Aldridge and [[Francesco DiCosmo]] on bass.<ref name=\"Thin Lizzy official website\">{{cite web|url=http://www.thinlizzyonline.com |title=Thin Lizzy official website |publisher=Thinlizzyonline.com |accessdate=3 April 2011}}</ref>\n\nSykes stated that Thin Lizzy was now \"more of a tribute thing\"<ref name=\"sykes99\" /> and that it would be wrong to record new material under that name. He added that while the existing band members might record together, it would not be as Thin Lizzy.<ref name=\"sykes99\" /> In 2007, Gorham said that Lynott still received the biggest cheer of the night at concerts, and that the current Thin Lizzy was not active simply for money.<ref name=\"gorham\">{{cite web|url=http://www.liverpool.com/features/interview-with-thin-lizzy-s-scott-gorham.html |title=Interview with Scott Gorham, December 2007 |publisher=Liverpool F.C. |accessdate=3 April 2011}}</ref> \"We'd stop if we thought we were just going through the motions...

On 30 June, the band's website announced that Sykes had left Thin Lizzy and all shows for the rest of 2009 were cancelled or postponed. Gorham stated that he would announce Thin Lizzy's future plans shortly. In a statement, he said, \"It's been a very tough time of late for myself and the band, firstly with drummer Tommy Aldridge's injury and now the subsequent decision for John and the rest of the group to go their separate ways.

Joining Gorham was original drummer Brian Downey, long-standing keyboardist Darren Wharton, [[Def Leppard]] guitarist [[Vivian Campbell]], and singer [[Ricky Warwick]] from [[The Almighty (band)|The Almighty]], while Marco Mendoza returned to fill the bass guitar role. Ex-Lizzy guitarist Brian Robertson was asked if he wanted to participate but had previous commitments to his own solo career.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rockpages.gr/detailspage.aspx?id=5663&type=1&lang=EN|title=Rock Pages interview with Brian Robertson}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to a full UK and European tour beginning in January 2011, the band initially announced a concert for 4 January at the [[The O2 (Dublin)|O2 Arena]] in Dublin, which was in conflict with the 2011 \"Vibe for Philo\".

He suggested Tin Lizzie, the name of a robot character from the comic, itself named for the common nickname for the iconic [[Ford Model T]] car. Bell also suggested they change 'Tin' to 'Thin' to play on the Irish accent's propensity to drop the 'h'. After a while, Lynott and Downey agreed to the idea and the name stuck, as they thought the confusion was amusing and would create a talking point.<ref name=\"putterford\" /><ref name=\"bailie\" /> For some of their early gigs, the band were mistakenly promoted as \"Tin Lizzy\" or \"Tin Lizzie\".<ref name=\"brooks\" />\n<span id=\"personnel\">\n\n==Style and legacy==\n[[File:Thin Lizzy 1978-Live and Dangerous lineup.jpg|thumb|220px|right|The classic line-up showing the band's famous \"twin guitar\" sound.

Though others had earlier used similar techniques, Thin Lizzy are widely recognised as one of the first hard rock bands to employ double lead guitar harmony sound \u2013 a technique pioneered by [[Peter Green's Fleetwood Mac]] and [[Wishbone Ash]] in the UK, whilst independently in the USA by [[Lynyrd Skynyrd]] and [[The Allman Brothers Band]]. This style was later refined and popularised in the mid-1970s by bands like Thin Lizzy and [[Judas Priest]], and later by the emerging [[New Wave of British Heavy Metal]] groups such as [[Iron Maiden]] and [[Def Leppard]]. Iron Maiden covered the song \"Massacre\" from Thin Lizzy's ''[[Johnny the Fox]]'' album, and released it on their 1988 single [[Can I Play with Madness]].
