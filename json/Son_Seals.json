He began performing professionally by the age of 13, first as a [[drummer]] with [[Robert Nighthawk]], and later as a guitarist.  At age 16, he began to play at the T-99, a local upper echelon club, with Walter Jefferson, \u201cLittle Walter\u201d, who was his brother in law.  At the T-99, he played with many other musicians, such as [[Albert King]], [[Rufus Thomas]], [[Bobby Bland]], [[Junior Parker]], and [[Rosco Gordon]].  Their varying styles contributed to the development of Seals' own playing techniques.  While playing at the T-99, he was also introduced to [[Country music|country]]-[[Western Music (North America)|western]] music by Jimmy Grubbs, who would ask Seals to gig with his group every now and then on both drums and guitar.  At 19 years old, he formed his own band to fill in at a local club in Osceola called the Rebel Club.  Shortly thereafter, a man from [[Little Rock, Arkansas]] came to find \u201cLittle Walter\u201d for a gig at his club, but when he turned it down the offer went to Seals.  The band members were \u201cOld man Horse\u201d (Johnny Moore) on piano, Alvin Goodberry on either drums, guitar, bass, or piano, \u201cLittle Bob\u201d (Robinson) on vocals, and Walter Lee \u201cSkinny Dynamo\u201d Harris on piano.  The band\u2019s name was \u201cSon Seals and the Upsetters.\u201d<ref>''Son Seals: Intensity is the Key,'' D. Thomas Moon, Living Blues, 2000, Issue 153, pp. 15-25, ISBN 00245232.</ref>      \n\nIn 1971, Seals moved to [[Chicago]]. His career took off after he was discovered by [[Bruce Iglauer]] of [[Alligator Records]] at the 'Flamingo Club' in [[Chicago's South Side]].  His debut [[album]], ''The Son Seals Blues Band'', was released in 1973. The album included \"Your Love Is Like a Cancer\" and \"Hot Sauce\".  Seals followed up with 1976's ''Midnight Son'' and 1978's ''Live and Burning''. He continued releasing albums throughout the next two decades, all but one on Alligator Records. These included ''Chicago Fire'' (1980), ''Bad Axe'' (1984), ''Living in the Danger Zone'' (1991), ''[[Nothing But the Truth (Son Seals album)|Nothing But the Truth]]'' and ''Live-Spontaneous Combustion'' (1996). He received the [[Blues Music Award|W.C. Handy Award]] in 1985, 1987, and 2001. \n\nAuthor [[Andrew Vachss]] was a friend of Seals, and used his influence to promote Seals' music.  Vachss gave Seals several [[cameo appearance]]s in his [[novel]]s<ref>[http://www.vachss.com/media/music/sons.html ''Son Seals,''] excerpted from ''Dead and Gone,'' by Andrew Vachss, Knopf, 2000.</ref> and co-wrote songs with him for his 2000 album, ''Lettin' Go''.<ref>''Keepin' On,'' Owen Cordle, ''News & Observer (Raleigh, N.C.),'' March 16, 2001.</ref>  Vachss dedicated the novel ''[[Burke (character)|Mask Market]]'' to Seals' memory.<ref>''Mask Market,'' by Andrew Vachss, Pantheon, 2006.</ref>\n\nIn 2002, Seals was featured on the [[Bo Diddley]] tribute album, ''Hey Bo Diddley - A Tribute!'', performing the song \"My Story\" (aka \"Story of Bo Diddley\").\n\nSeals had a number of problems in his life. He survived all but one of his fourteen [[sibling]]s, and in 1997 he was shot in the jaw by his wife, sustaining injuries which required reconstructive surgery.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.apnewsarchive.com/1997/Chicago-bluesman-Son-Seals-shot-wife-charged/id-4a3fdb639855c426481c013ef2bcccdc|title=Chicago bluesman Son Seals shot, wife charged|publisher=Associated Press, January 7, 1997}}</ref> Also, in 1999 part of his left leg was [[amputation|amputated]], due to complications from [[Diabetes mellitus|diabetes]].
