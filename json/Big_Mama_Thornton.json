She was the first to record [[Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller|Leiber and Stoller's]] \"[[Hound Dog (song)|Hound Dog]]\" in 1952,<ref name=\"russell\"/> which became her biggest hit. It spent seven weeks at number one on the [[Billboard charts|Billboard R&B charts]] in 1953<ref>[{{BillboardURLbyName|artist=big mama thornton|bio=true}} Billboard: Big Mama Thornton \u2013 Biography]</ref> and sold almost two million copies.<ref>[http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/TT/fthpg.html University of Texas: Willa Mae Thornton]</ref> However, her success was overshadowed three years later, when [[Elvis Presley]] recorded his more popular rendition of \"Hound Dog\".<ref name=pc7/> Similarly, Thornton's \"[[Ball 'n' Chain]]\" had a bigger impact when performed and recorded by [[Janis Joplin]] in the late 1960s.\n\n==Style==\n\nThornton's performances were characterized by her deep, powerful voice and strong sense of self. Many collaborators described her with words such as monstrous, intimidating, formidable, and menacing.{{Citation needed|date=June 2014}} She was given her nickname, \"Big Mama,\" by Frank Schiffman, manager of Harlem's Apollo Theater, due to her big voice, size, and personality. Thornton specialized in playing drums and harmonica as well as singing, and she taught herself how to play these instruments simply by watching other musicians perform. Her style was heavily influenced by the gospel music that she witnessed growing up in the home of a preacher, though her genre could be described as blues.<ref name=\"Mahon\">{{cite journal|last1=Mahon|first1=Maureen|title=Listening for Willie Mae \"Big Mama\" Thornton\u2019s Voice: The Sound of Race and Gender Transgressions in Rock and Roll|journal=Women and Music: A Journal of Gender and Culture|date=2011|volume=15|pages=1\u201317|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/women_and_music/v015/15.mahon.html}}</ref>\n\nThornton was famous for her transgressive gender expression. She often dressed as a man in her performances, wearing items such as work shirts and slacks. This led to many rumors about her sexuality, though none confirmed. Her improvisation was a notable part of her performance. She often enters call-and-response exchanges with her band, inserting confident and notably subversive remarks. Her play with gender and sexuality set the stage for later rock 'n' roll artists' own plays with sexuality.<ref name=\"Mahon\">{{cite journal|last1=Mahon|first1=Maureen|title=Listening for Willie Mae \"Big Mama\" Thornton\u2019s Voice: The Sound of Race and Gender Transgressions in Rock and Roll|journal=Women and Music: A Journal of Gender and Culture|date=2011|volume=15|pages=1\u201317|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/women_and_music/v015/15.mahon.html}}</ref>\n\nFeminist scholars such as Maureen Mahon often praise Thornton for subverting traditional roles of African American women.<ref name=\"Mahon\">{{cite journal|last1=Mahon|first1=Maureen|title=Listening for Willie Mae \"Big Mama\" Thornton\u2019s Voice: The Sound of Race and Gender Transgressions in Rock and Roll|journal=Women and Music: A Journal of Gender and Culture|date=2011|volume=15|pages=1\u201317|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/women_and_music/v015/15.mahon.html}}</ref> She added a female voice to a field that was dominated by white males, and her strong personality transgressed patriarchal and white supremacist stereotypes of what an African American woman should be.

Mercury released her most successful album, ''Stronger Than Dirt'', which reached number 198 in the [[Billboard Top 200]] record chart.
