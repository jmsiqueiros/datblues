He originally grew up playing the banjo, but his father wanted him to be a [[jazz]] musician.  Upon hearing that the banjo was originally an African instrument turned almost exclusively into a white [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]] instrument in part through the derogatory black-face [[minstrel shows]] of the 19th century, Taylor dropped the banjo and began to focus solely on the guitar and harmonica.  He played music professionally both in [[Europe]] and the United States in a variety of blues-oriented bands, including [[Zephyr (band)|Zephyr]], until 1977, when he left the [[music industry]] for other pursuits, including becoming an [[antique]] dealer.  \n\nTaylor returned to music in 1995, and as of 2008, has released nine blues albums on several [[record label]]s.
